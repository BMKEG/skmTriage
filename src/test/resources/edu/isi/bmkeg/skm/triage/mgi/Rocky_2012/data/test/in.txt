20019746	www.nature.com cdd Paired-like homeodomain 2 Pitx2 is a member of the bicoid class of paired homeodomain proteins that is mutated in patients affected by the Axenfeld–Rieger syndrome ARS , an autosomal dominant haploinsufficient disorder that includes tooth anomalies , anterior segment eye defects , umbilical abnormalities , and facial dysmorphologies as cardinal fea-tures.1 The phenotype of mice with targeted deletion of Pitx2 mimics , in part , Axenfeld–Rieger syndrome , 2–5 and its analysis established the critical role of Pitx2 in the develop-ment of cranio-facial structures , and of multiple organs including eye , pituitary , heart , and lung . Pitx2 is expressed in myotomes and migrating myoblasts3,6,7 and has been implicated in growth and survival of branchiomeric muscle progenitors.7–9 At early developmental stages , Pitx2 has been involved in the establishment of left–right asymmetry.10–13 We previously showed that Pitx2 activates the transcription of specific growth-regulating genes such as those encoding Ccnd1 and Ccnd2 also known as Cyclins D1 and D2 and it is also profoundly involved in the stabilization of the correspond-ing messengers during Wnt activation.6,14 Moreover , Pitx2 mRNA is stabilized by Wnt activation , and this effect is mediated by AU-rich elements AREs in its 30 untranslated region 30UTR .14 We showed that Pitx2 protein is required for stabilization of its own mRNA , as well as of those encoding Ccnd1 and Ccnd2.14 This effect is achieved , in part , by modulating the function of the ARE-binding protein ARE-BP HuR as Pitx2 and HuR belong to the same complex.14 It is now clear that mRNA decay regulation by different signals makes a huge contribution to the global control of gene expression.15 AREs , located in the 30UTR of many short-lived transcripts , promote mRNA deadenylation , decapping , and degradation , with ARE-BPs functioning as trans-acting factors responsible for the modulation of decay rates.16,17 Some ARE-BPs are decay-promoting factors TTP , BRF1 , KSRP and others , such as HuR , are stabilizing factors.16 Skeletal muscle formation or myogenesis is a complex and highly regulated process that involves the proliferation of myoblasts , followed by morphological , biochemical , and molecular modifications , which result in the formation of multinucleated myotubes.18–20 The C2C12 myogenic cell line , derived from regenerating adult mouse skeletal muscle , provides a good in vitro model for studying the major steps of myoblast proliferation and differentiation 21 and literature cited therein . We have reported that the tight control of the decay rates of transcripts encoding several pro-myogenic factors , in addition to their transcriptional regulation , is essential to ensure that the correct differentiation program takes place.21–23 HuR , regulating the expression of the mRNAs encoding the pro-myogenic transcription factors MyoD and myogenin has a key role in muscle fiber formation.21,22 As HuR and Pitx2 associate to stabilize target transcripts , 14 we hypothesized that the two proteins could cooperate to affect the fate of myoblasts during the myogenic process . In this study , we report that Pitx2 is necessary to ensure proper C2C12 myoblast proliferation and differentia-tion . Pitx2 and HuR belong to the same ribonucleoprotein complex that controls the decay rate of the Ccnd1 mRNA , and this function is regulated by Pitx2 phosphorylation by Akt2 . Results Pitx2 is phosphorylated by Akt2 in C2C12 myoblasts . In a screening for protein serine threonine kinases able to phosphorylate in vitro Pitx2 Gherzi R , unpublished results , we found that Akt2 is able to phosphorylate , in a concentration-dependent manner , the purified recombinant Pitx2c portion encompassing amino acids 1–160 , whereas it does not phosphorylate the C-terminal part of the protein including amino acids 161–324 Figure 1a , left panel . An in silico search http scansite.mit.edu for potential Akt2 phosphorylation sites indicated threonine 97 , embedded in a nearly perfect consensus sequence RQRTHFT , as the most probable Akt2 target residue . Indeed , Akt2 failed to phosphorylate the mutant Pitx2c 1–160 in which threonine 97 was substituted with alanine Pitx2c 1–160T97A , Figure 1a , right panel . The sequence RQRTHFT is located in the homeodomain , is present in the three Pitx2 splicing variants , and is evolutionarily conserved from Drosophila to human Figure 1b . As expected , Akt2 is able to phosphorylate in vitro Pitx2a and b data not shown . Akt1 does not phosphorylate Pitx2c in vitro , although it phosphorylates KSRP , which is used as a control 24 Figure 1c . Interestingly , human PITX2A is phosphorylated by PKC in 10 different residues including threonine 44 , which corresponds to mouse Pitx2c threonine 97.25 Considering the role of Pitx2 during muscle development8,9 and the function of PI3K–Akt signaling in myoblast differentia-tion , 26,27 we chose to study the functional relevance of Pitx2 phosphorylation by Akt2 in C2C12 cells that differentiate into myotubes upon shift from growth medium GM to low-serum-containing differentiation medium DM .23 As shown in Figure 1d , endogenous Pitx2 was phosphorylated in response to DM in intact C2C12 cells . Furthermore , constitutively active Akt2 induced 32P incorpora-tion into Flag-tagged Pitx2c when coexpressed in proliferating C2C12 cells Supplementary Figure S1a . Finally , Akt2 immunopurified from C2C12 cells , either maintained in GM or exposed to DM for different intervals of time , was used to phosphorylate Pitx2c 1–160 in vitro . As shown in Supple-mentary Figure S1b , the kinase activity of Akt2 toward Pitx2c was rapidly 1 h enhanced by exposure to DM. Akt2 activity was maintained up to 36 h in DM and started declining between 36 and 48 h of differentiation , whereas the expres-sion of the enzyme remained unchanged Supplementary Figure S1b . Altogether , these data show that Pitx2 is a substrate for Akt2 at early phases of C2C12 cell differentiation . Pitx2 is required for C2C12 myoblast differentiation . To gain an insight into Pitx2 function in the course of C2C12 cell differentiation , we transiently knocked down the three Pitx2 isoforms by RNA interference siRNA , Figure 2a . The expression of some myogenic differentiation markers , including Myog also called myogenin , Ckm also called muscle creatine kinase , Myod1 , and Cdkn1a also called p21 , was severely impaired in siPitx2-transfected C2C12 cells induced to differentiate by DM Figure 2b . On the contrary , the expression of an early marker of myoblast progenitors and satellite cells Pax7 , as well as markers of myogenic determination such as Myf5 , and Myf6 also called Mrf4 20 remained unchanged Supplementary Figure S1c . Pax3 , another marker of myoblast progenitors , 20 is not expressed in C2C12 cells . To extend our observations , we prepared a short-hairpin sh RNA-based vector targeting mouse Pitx2 and generated two independent stable C2C12 clones , in which approxi-mately 70 % of Pitx2 was knocked down data not shown . The two clones yielded superimposable results and henceforth are collectively cited as C2C12-shPitx2 cells . We confirmed in C2C12-shPitx2 cells that Pitx2 is required for the proper expression of myogenic factors Figure 2c , Supplementary Figure S1d , e , including members of the recently described class of myogenic miRNAs28 Supplementary Figure S1f . Accordingly , connexin 43 , a described target of miR-206 , was upregulated in C2C12-shPitx2 cells 28 and literature cited therein Supplementary Figure S1g . Our data indicate that Pitx2 is required for differentiation of C2C12 myoblasts into myotubes . Pitx2 controls C2C12 myoblast proliferation and affects Ccnd1 mRNA decay . We previously reported that Pitx2 controls cell proliferation in specific tissues.6 Here , we found that Pitx2 knockdown causes a growth reduction in C2C12 cells cultured in GM as assessed by crystal violet staining Supplementary Figure S2a . Using C2C12-shPitx2 cells , we confirmed by both BrdU incorporation into DNA and crystal violet staining that Pitx2 knockdown reduces the proliferation of exponentially growing myoblasts , whereas it does not affect the proliferation rate of cells cultured in DM Figure 3a and b . Conversely , Pitx2 knockdown did not induce apoptosis in C2C12 cells Supplementary Figure S2b . In agreement with our previous findings , 6,14 Pitx2 knock-down reduced the expression of Ccnd1 in proliferating C2C12 myoblasts Figure 3c , Supplementary Figure S2c , whereas it did not affect Ccnd1 expression in differentiating C2C12 cells Supplementary Figure S2d . Surprisingly , we found that Pitx2 is predominantly cyto-plasmic in C2C12 cells and this observation was confirmed by using two different anti-Pitx2 antibodies Figure 3d and data not shown . We previously reported that Pitx2 is able to controls the expression of Ccnd1 and other transcripts at both transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels.6,14 The subcellular localization of Pitx2 in C2C12 cells prompted us to investigate the consequences of Pitx2 knockdown on the decay rate of Ccnd1 mRNA in these cells . In vitro degradation assays revealed that Ccnd1 mRNA is stable in proliferating C2C12 myoblasts and its half-life is reduced by serum withdrawal-induced differentiation Supplementary Figure S3a . These data are consistent with the reduction in Ccnd1 mRNA levels that we observed in the course of C2C12 cell differentiation Supplementary Figure S3b . Most importantly , transient Pitx2 knockdown significantly shortened the Ccnd1 transcript half-life in intact proliferating C2C12 myoblasts , whereas the decay rate of Myog mRNA was unaffected Figure 3e . Similar results were obtained on stable Pitx2 knockdown using in vitro degradation assays Supplementary Figure S3c . We have previously shown that , although it is not able to directly bind to mRNA , Pitx2 participates in a ribonucleopro-tein complex containing , among others , the mRNA stabilizing factor HuR 14 Briata P , unpublished . Furthermore , HuR has been reported to target the inherently labile Ccnd1 transcript and to induce its stabilization.29,30 By ribonucleoprotein complex immunoprecipitation RIP analysis , we found that anti-Pitx2 antibody immunoprecipitates a Ccnd1 mRNA-containing ribonucleoprotein complex from C2C12 cell extracts and that this interaction is reduced by cell differentia-tion Figure 3f upper panel . Similarly , HuR binding to Ccnd1 mRNA is reduced in differentiated C2C12 myotubes when compared with proliferating C2C12 myoblasts Figure 3f lower panel . These results suggest that Pitx2 modulates cell proliferation and Ccnd1 mRNA half-life by participating in a ribonucleo-protein complex that contains HuR . Phosphorylation by Akt2 impairs the ability of Pitx2 to associate with a Ccnd1 mRNA-stabilizing complex . On the basis of the above results , we investigated whether HuR–Ccnd1 mRNA interaction depends on Pitx2 . As shown in Figure 4a , transient Pitx2 knockdown reduced the interaction of HuR with Ccnd1 mRNA in proliferating C2C12 cells upper panel without affecting HuR expression levels lower panel . PI3K–Akt activation favors the differentiation of myoblasts into myotubes 26 and Figure 4b left panel . Importantly , forced activation of Akt2 induced a significant reduction in Ccnd1 mRNA levels in C2C12 cells , reducing the half-life of Ccnd1 mRNA Figure 4b right panel , Supplementary Figure S3d . Furthermore , Akt2 activation decreased the ability of Pitx2 to participate in the Ccnd1 stabilizing complex Figure 4c , upper panel and of HuR to interact with Ccnd1 mRNA Figure 4c , lower panel . It is well known that phosphorylation by Akt kinases can change the ability of substrate proteins to interact with molecular partners.31 By GST pull-down experiments , we found that phosphorylation by Akt2 increases the ability of Pitx2c to interact with the multifunctional protein 14-3-3 while decreasing its ability to interact with HuR Figure 4d . Under the same conditions , Pitx2cT97A , which does not undergo Akt2 phosphorylation Figure 1a , was unable to interact with 14-3-3 , whereas it associated with HuR Figure 4d . Accordingly , coimmunoprecipitation experiments revealed that Pitx2 interaction with HuR was strongly reduced in C2C12 cells cultured in DM , whereas Pitx2 interaction with 14-3-3 was increased Figure 4e and f , and Supplementary Figure S3e . Next , we investigated whether the expression of Pitx2c-T97A in C2C12 cells Supplementary Figure 3f interferes with their differentiation . First , RIP experiments revealed that Ccnd1 mRNA remained associated with Pitx2cT97A expressed in C2C12 cells on differentiation induction Figure 5a . In keeping with these observations , Pitx2cT97A remained associated with HuR on shift of C2C12 cells to DM Figure 5b . As shown in Figure 5c , DM failed to downregulate Ccnd1 mRNA and induce myogenin mRNAs in C2C12 cells expressing Pitx2cT97A . Altogether , our data indicate that Pitx2 is a required factor for HuR–Ccnd1 mRNA interaction in proliferating C2C12 myoblasts and that Akt2 activation , inducing Pitx2 phosphorylation , causes its dismissal from the Ccnd1 mRNA-stabilizing complex . Discussion In this report , we show that Pitx2 is necessary to ensure proper proliferation of C2C12 myoblasts under high-serum culture conditions , as well as for their differentiation under low-serum culture conditions . In C2C12 cells , Pitx2 predominantly localizes in the cytoplasm and is part of an mRNA-stabilizing complex , including the ARE-BP HuR , which controls the Ccnd1 mRNA half-life . On Pitx2 phosphorylation by Akt2 , the Pitx2 HuR-containing complex is dismissed from Ccnd1 mRNA leading to destabilization of the transcript . The contribution of different Akt isoforms to myoblast differentiation is still debated.32 We found that Akt1 does not phosphorylate Pitx2c in vitro . This result is consistent with previous observations of isoform-specific phosphorylation of cellular substrates by Akt family members33,34 and with the reported preference for an arginine residue at position-5 absent in Pitx2c Akt recognition consensus site as displayed by Akt1.35 It has been shown that Pitx2 is implicated in myogenesis during mouse embryonic development.8,9 In this study , we propose that , in proliferating C2C12 myoblasts , Pitx2 is required to maintain an adequate rate of cell division . A similar role has been suggested for Pax3 and Pax7 in satellite cell-derived myoblasts.36 Pax3 is not expressed in C2C12 cells , whereas Pax7 expression is not affected by Pitx2 knockdown , thus suggesting that Pitx2 and Pax7 may regulate parallel pathways that converge on common target genes . However , it is noteworthy that Pitx2 knockdown is sufficient to severely impair the expression of myogenic differentiation markers such as Myog , Myod1 , Ckm , Cdkn1a , as well as myogenic miRNAs . We propose that Pitx2 , in concert with Pax3 and Pax7 , keeps myoblasts actively proliferating and poised for differentiation in response to appropriate environmental conditions . In our hypothesis , Pitx2 promotes C2C12 cell expansion , while maintaining commit-ment to the myogenic lineage . We previously reported that Pitx2 can exert a dual role regulating the expression of target genes not only transcrip-tionally but also posttranscriptionally , being able to modulate the turnover rate of select ARE-containing mRNAs , including Ccnd1 , in response to Wnt b-catenin activation.14 We now report that , in C2C12 cells , Pitx2 displays a predominant cytoplasmic localization and this observation prompted us to analyze in detail the role of Pitx2 on Ccnd1 mRNA turnover . Ccnd1 mRNA is rather stable in proliferating C2C12 myo - blasts , whereas it is destabilized on serum withdrawal-induced differentiation . Pitx2 seems to participate in these events because its knockdown reduces Ccnd1 transcript half-life and steady-state levels in proliferating C2C12 myoblasts . Studies conducted in Gorospe’s laboratory reported that Ccnd1 mRNA is a direct target of the stabilizing ARE-BP HuR.30 Indeed , we observed that HuR interaction with Ccnd1 mRNA is modulated by differentiation . We have previously suggested a role for Pitx2 in controlling HuR function in the context of a stabilizing ribonucleoprotein complex.14 Our present evidence , suggesting that Pitx2 knockdown impairs the ability of HuR to interact with Ccnd1 mRNA , emphasizes the role of Pitx2 as a required component of the HuR-containing stabilizing ribonucleoprotein complex . It has been shown that activation of the PI3K-Akt pathway strongly stimulates myogenesis , greatly increasing myotube formation in myoblast cultures and upregulating muscle-specific proteins.26,27 Here , we propose that Akt2-induced downregulation of Ccnd1 expression through destabilization of its mRNA represents an additional mechanism by which the signaling pathway controls the transition from the undiffer-entiated to the differentiated state in C2C12 cells . We previously reported that the PI3K-Akt pathway can affect the decay rate of ARE-containing transcripts regulating the function of relevant ARE-BPs.24 Once phosphorylated by Akt1 2 , KSRP and Brf1 , two destabilizing ARE-BPs , interact with the multifunctional protein 14-3-3 and , in turn , their function is compromised.24,37 HuR is not a substrate for Akt kinases Gherzi R , unpublished observation and we show that Akt2 activation modulates the function of HuR indirectly , through Pitx2 phosphorylation . The T97A Pitx2c mutant , which is not phosphorylated by Akt2 , is present in a ribonucleoprotein complex including HuR and Ccnd1 mRNA on shifting C2C12 culture medium to DM and , as a consequence , Ccnd1 expression is not down-regulated . Interestingly , myogenin mRNA levels are not induced in the same cells . These results strengthen the idea that modulation of Ccnd1 mRNA levels by Pitx2c is one of the mechanisms underlying C2C12 myoblast differentiation . Indeed , reduction of Ccnd1 transcript on specific knockdown in proliferating C2C12 myoblasts reduced the expression of some muscle-specific transcripts Briata P , unpublished , thus underscoring the requirement of a proper proliferation rate for the subsequent full differentiation . We propose that , in proliferating C2C12 myoblasts , Pitx2 interacts with HuR favoring its binding to Ccnd1 mRNA , which becomes more stable . When cells are shifted to DM , Akt2-phosphorylated Pitx2 fails to interact with HuR , whereas it associates with 14-3-3 . Consequently , HuR no longer binds to Ccnd1 mRNA , whose half-life is shortened . This mechanism summarized in the model presented in Figure 5d contributes to maintain a high proliferation rate in C2C12 cells cultured in GM and to arrest cell proliferation on shift to DM .

20489729	www.nature.com cdd It is estimated that glaucoma affects nearly 70 million individuals worldwide , including at least 6.8 million who are bilaterally blind.1 The disease is characterized by the slow progressive degeneration of the retinal ganglion cells RGCs and their axons , which are usually associated with elevated intraocular pressure IOP . Recent studies have shown that glaucoma is affected by multiple genes and environmental factors , 2,3 and there are several inherited and experimentally induced animal models of high IOP glaucoma , including DBA 2J mice and laser-induced chronic ocular hypertension model.4–6 There is a subtype of glaucoma termed normal tension glaucoma NTG , however , that presents with statistically normal IOP . The number of NTG patients has been thought to be small relative to the total number of glaucoma patients , but recent studies have revealed an unexpectedly high prevalence of NTG.7 These findings suggest that non-IOP-dependent factors may contribute to disease progression , and elucidating these factors is neces-sary to better understand the pathogenesis of glaucoma , especially in the context of NTG . For this purpose , an animal model representing disease characteristics of NTG would be extremely useful . To date , some animal models have been introduced , for example , the optic nerve ligation model shows RGC loss with normal IOP , 8 but this is more suitable as a model of ischemia or optic nerve injury . In addition , prepara-tion of these artificial models requires a high level of technical skills , but unfortunately , long-term reproducibility seems to be somewhat limited . Thus , there has been a great demand to create suitable animal models of NTG . In addition to more extensively studied factors such as reduced ocular blood flow and systemic blood pressure changes , excessive stimulation of the glutamatergic system has been proposed to contribute to the death of RGCs in glaucoma . Excessive extracellular concentrations of glutamate induce uncontrolled elevation of intracellular calcium , which enters through chronically activated glutamate receptors . Glutamate uptake by the glial cells is a well-known mechanism to maintain low extracellular levels of glutamate and promote efficient interneuronal signaling in the central nervous system CNS . Furthermore , the same process is considered to be neuroprotective during neurodegeneration . Clearance of glutamate from the extracellular space is accomplished primarily by the action of glutamate transpor-ters.9 In the CNS , the glutamate aspartate transporter GLAST and glutamate transporter 1 GLT-1 are Na ? -dependent glutamate transporters found in astrocytes . Genetic deletion of GLAST and or GLT-1 causes abnormal brain development and neurological symptoms such as motor deficits.9–11 We have previously reported that GLAST , located in Muller ¨ glial cells , is the only glial-type glutamate transporter in the retina , whereas GLT-1 is expressed in neurons , including bipolar cells and photoreceptors.12 Not surprisingly , GLAST is more active than GLT-1 in preventing glutamate neurotoxicity after ischemia.12 In addition , we recently found that GLAST-deficient GLAST and GLAST ? mice show spontaneous RGC death and optic nerve degeneration without elevated IOP.13 Interestingly , GLAST is essential not only to keep the extracellular glutamate concentration below a neurotoxic level but also to maintain glutathione levels by transporting glutamate , which is a substrate for glutathione synthesis , into Muller ¨ cells . As retinal concentration of glutathione , a major cellular antioxidant in the retina , was decreased in GLAST-deficient mice , both glutamate neuro-toxicity and oxidative stress may be involved in NTG-like pathology.13 Together with the evidence that downregulation of GLAST human EAAT1 in the retina and of glutathione level in the plasma are found in human glaucoma patients , 14,15 it is appropriate to consider GLAST-deficient mice as a valid and adequate model that offer a powerful system to determine the mechanisms of and evaluate new treatments for NTG . Apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 ASK1 has key roles in human diseases closely related to the dysfunction of cellular responses to oxidative stress and endoplasmic reti-culum stressors , including neurodegenerative diseases.16,17 We have previously reported that ASK1 is primarily expressed in RGCs , and ASK1 mice are less susceptible to ischemic injury.18 The role of ASK1 in glaucoma , however , is unknown . In an attempt to identify the apoptotic signals regulating RGC death in GLAST-deficient mice , we generated GLAST ? ASK1 and GLAST ASK1 mice and determined the effect of ASK1 deficiency on the NTG-like phenotype . Results ASK1 deficiency protects visual function in GLAST - deficient mice . To determine whether ASK1 deficiency is capable of preventing the NTG-like phenotype in GLAST-deficient mice , 13 GLAST ? ASK1 ? mice were interbred and genotyped at weaning . GLAST ? ASK1 and GLAST ASK1 mice were born in accordance with Mendelian inheritance ratios , survived into adulthood and were fertile . We first examined the visual function of these mice at 3 months of age 3 M using multifocal electroretinograms mfERGs , an established noninvasive method.13 Figure 1a and b show the averaged responses of the second-order kernel in each group . The visual function of WT and ASK1 mice was indistinguishable Figure 1c . As we have previously reported , visual function in the GLAST ? and GLAST mice was impaired in all visual fields , but was clearly improved by ASK1 deficiency Figure 1a–c . In particular , the amplitude of the secondary kernel in GLAST ? ASK1 mice 4.7±0.4 nV deg2 n ? 8 was not significantly different compared with WT mice 5.0±0.3 nV deg2 n ? 9 P ? 0.67 , Figure 1c . These results suggest that ASK1 deficiency has no harmful effects during development and prevents visual disturbances in GLAST-deficient mice . ASK1 deficiency protects retinal neurons in GLAST - deficient mice . We next analyzed the histopathology of the retina . Consistent with the results of the mfERGs , the retina of ASK1 mice showed normal organization at 3 weeks 3 W , 3 M and 6 M Figure 2 . Cell number in the ganglion cell layer GCL was significantly decreased after 3 M in GLAST ? mice and after 3 W in GLAST mice Figures 2 and 3a . In addition , the thickness of the inner retinal layer IRL was decreased after 3 M in both strains Figure 3b . In GLAST ? ASK1 mice , however , GCL cell number was significantly increased at 3 M and 6 M compared with GLAST ? mice Figure 3a . IRL thickness was increased to a normal level 105±11 % at 3 M and 95±11 % at 6 M n ? 6 in GLAST ? ASK1 mice Figure 3b . In GLAST ASK1 mice , IRL thickness was significantly increased at 3 M and 6 M compared with GLAST mice Figure 3b . In addition , GCL cell number was increased at 3 W and 3 M , but not at 6 M Figure 3a . These results suggest that ASK1 deficiency prevents the loss of RGCs and secondary retinal degeneration in GLAST-deficient mice . ASK1 deficiency prevents optic nerve degeneration in GLAST-deficient mice . As nearly half of the cells in the rodent GCL are displaced amacrine cells , we needed to distinguish RGCs from displaced amacrine cells by retrograde labeling.18 As ASK1 deficiency was most effec-tive in 3 M GLAST ? mice , we examined RGC number in WT , ASK1 , GLAST ? and GLAST ? ASK1 mice at 3 M Figure 4a–h . RGC number per square millimeter in ASK1 mice 4200±238 n ? 3 was normal compared with WT mice 4050±170 n ? 3 P ? 0.64 , Figure 4m . In GLAST ? mice , RGC number 3358±180 n ? 3 was significantly reduced compared with WT mice Po0.05 . However , RGC number in GLAST ? ASK1 mice 4067±121 n ? 3 was clearly increased compared with GLAST ? mice Po0.05 and in normal range compared with WT mice P ? 0.94 , Figure 4m . Similarly , RGC number in GLAST ASK1 mice 3392±102 n ? 3 was increa-sed compared with GLAST mice 2592±269 n ? 3 Po0.05 , Figure 4m . Degeneration of the optic nerve is one of the hallmarks of glaucoma . To analyze morphological changes in the optic nerve , semi-thin transverse sections were cut and stained with toluidine blue Figure 4i–l . Consistent with severe RGC loss , the degenerating axons in 3 M GLAST ? mice had abnormally dark axonal profiles arrowheads in Figure 4k . Such degenerating axons , however , were almost absent in GLAST ? ASK1 mice Figure 4l . Taken together , these results demonstrate that ASK1 deficiency protects against RGC loss and optic nerve degeneration in GLAST-deficient mice , which leads to improved visual function as detected by mfERG Figure 1 . IOP measurement in GLAST ASK1 double-deficient mice . We have previously reported that GLAST-deficient mice show normal IOP compared with WT mice.13 To determine the effect of ASK1 on IOP , we examined the IOP of ASK1 , GLAST ? ASK1 and GLAST ASK1 mice . IOP measurements were carried out at around 2100 hours , when IOP is highest in mouse eyes.19 The IOP values of ASK1 , GLAST ? ASK1 and GLAST ASK1 mice were not significantly decreased compared with WT and GLAST mice Figure 5 . These results suggest that the recovery of NTG-like pathology in GLAST ? ASK1 and GLAST ASK1 mice is IOP independent . Role of oxidative stress and glutamate neurotoxicity in GLAST ASK1 double-deficient mice . Oxidative stress has been proposed to contribute to RGC death in glaucoma , and a reduction in glutathione levels was repor-ted in the plasma of human glaucoma patients.15 Consistent with these findings , we have previously reported a decreased glutathione concentration in the retina of GLAST mice.13 To determine the effect of ASK1 on glutathione synthesis , we examined the glutathione concentration in the retina of 6 M ASK1 and GLAST ASK1 mice and found that it was not significantly increased compared with WT and GLAST mice , respectively Figure 6a . In addition , the malondialdehyde concentration in the retina of ASK1 and GLAST ASK1 mice was indistinguishable from that of WT and GLAST mice , respectively Figure 6b . We have previously reported that intravitreal glutamate concentration is normal , but memantine , N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist , partially protected RGCs in GLAST mice.13 In addition , we showed that GLAST has a major role in glutamate uptake into Muller ¨ glial cells.20 To explore the possibility that ASK1 is involved in glutamate transport , we examined glutamate uptake activity in Muller ¨ glial cells prepared from ASK1 and GLAST ? ASK1 mice , and found that it was not significantly increased compared with WT and GLAST ? mice , respectively Figure 7 . These findings suggest that ASK1 deficiency attenuates NTG-like degenera-tion without affecting the conditions of oxidative stress and glutamate neurotoxicity in GLAST-deficient mice . Effect of ASK1-p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase MAPK signaling in Muller ¨ glial cells and RGCs . ASK1 is activated in response to cytotoxic stresses , including reactive oxygen species ROS and tumor necrosis factor TNF , and relays these signals to p38 MAPK.16,17 To determine whether this pathway is active in Muller ¨ glial cells , we first examined the effects of TNF on cultured Muller ¨ cells from WT and ASK1 mice . Western blot analysis demon-strated that stimulation of WT Muller ¨ cells with TNF leads to strong phosphorylation of p38 in a dose-dependent manner Figure 8a . The activation of p38 , however , was significantly suppressed in ASK1-deficient Muller ¨ cells Figure 8a . Nitric oxide NO generated by inducible nitric oxide synthase iNOS is involved in retinal neuronal cell death , 21,22 and a previous study has reported that TNF-induced iNOS expression and NO release are suppressed by a specific inhibitor of p38 in mouse astrocytes.23 These results suggest that the ASK1-p38 pathway regulates TNF-induced iNOS expression in Muller¨ cells . To evaluate this possibility , we next examined iNOS protein levels in cultured Muller ¨ cells . In untreated Muller ¨ cells , iNOS protein was almost absent , but TNF clearly increased iNOS expression levels Figure 8b . Similar iNOS induction was detected in GLAST-deficient Muller ¨ cells Figure 8b . However , TNF-induced iNOS expression was completely suppressed in ASK1-deficient Muller ¨ cells Figure 8b . These results suggest that the ASK1-p38 pathway is required in Muller ¨ cells for the TNF-induced iNOS production , which may lead to the death of retinal neurons including RGCs . We further examined the direct effect of TNF on cultured RGCs.18 TNF-induced cell death in cultured RGCs from ASK1-deficient mice was significantly decreased 41±9 % n ? 6 compared with that from WT mice Po0.05 , Figure 8c . Taken together , loss of ASK1 prevents TNF-induced RGC death through both the direct pathway and the indirect pathway through Muller ¨ cells that is independent of GLAST . In this study , we show that ASK1 is associated with progressive RGC loss , glaucomatous optic nerve degenera-tion and visual disturbances in GLAST-deficient mice . We previously suggested the possibility that dysfunction of GLAST human EAAT1 has a role in RGC death in human NTG.13 It has been reported that EAAT1 is downregulated in the retinas of human patients with glaucoma14 and in fibroblasts from patients with Alzheimer’s disease.24 Con-sidering the high frequency of glaucoma in Alzheimer’s disease patients , 25 common mechanisms such as GLAST dysfunction might contribute to both diseases . Interestingly , ROS-mediated ASK1 activation is a key mechanism for amyloid beta Ab -induced neurotoxicity , which has a central role in Alzheimer’s disease.26 The accumulation of Ab is also observed in apoptotic RGCs in a rat model of glaucoma due to high IOP.27 In this model , inhibiting amyloidogenic pathways by agents affecting multiple stages of the Ab pathway reduces RGC apoptosis in vivo.27 This suggests a new hypothesis for RGC death in glaucoma involving ASK1-dependent Ab neurotoxicity , mimicking Alzheimer’s disease.28 In addi-tion , multiple single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the Toll-like receptor 4 TLR4 gene have been associated with the risk of NTG.29 As ASK1 is required for innate immune responses dependent on TLR4,30 TLR4-ASK1 signaling may be involved in the development of NTG . Taken together , these findings suggest that ASK1 may have roles in various neuro-degenerative disorders , including glaucoma.16–18 Our present results demonstrate reduced RGC death , decreased axonal loss and mild visual disturbance in GLAST ? ASK1 and GLAST ASK1 mice , high-lighting ASK1 as a potential therapeutic target for NTG . Loss of ASK1 had no effect on IOP Figure 5 , the production of malondialdehyde Figure 6 or glutamate uptake activity by Muller ¨ cells Figure 7 . Whereas TNF-induced iNOS produc-tion was suppressed in ASK1-deficient Muller ¨ cells , and ASK1-deficient RGCs were more resistant to TNF-induced death compared with WT RGCs Figure 8 . Thus , in combi-nation with conventional treatments to lower IOP , inhibition of ASK1 signaling may be useful in the treatment of glaucoma . In addition , we recently reported that interleukin-1 IL-1 increases glutamate uptake by Muller ¨ cells , primarily through the activation of GLAST , and protects RGCs from glutamate neurotoxicity.20,31 IL-1 is a mediator of brain injury induced by ischemia or trauma and has been implicated in chronic brain diseases , such as Alzheimer’s disease , Parkinson’s disease and multiple sclerosis.32 Therefore , we need to examine the beneficial and detrimental roles of IL-1 during glaucoma in vivo . Furthermore , we are undertaking experi-ments to determine the neuroprotective effect of GLAST against neurotoxicity , axotomy and neuroinflammation in mice overexpressing GLAST . A recent study has shown that upregulation of GLAST in Muller ¨ cells by glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor GDNF and neurturin NTN is required to rescue RGCs following optic nerve transection.33 As the receptors for GDNF and NTN are increased in Muller ¨ cells after RGC axotomy , the neuroprotective effects of GDNF and NTN may be indirect , at least partly , through the enhancement of glutamate uptake in Muller ¨ cells . Similar upregulation of the receptors for GDNF and NTN has been observed in a rat model of photoreceptor degeneration.34,35 In this animal model , trophic factors such as nerve growth factor , brain-derived neurotrophic factor and basic fibroblast growth factor increase the production of multiple trophic factors in Muller ¨ cells , which indirectly leads to photoreceptor survival.35–37 In addition , nerve growth factor eye drops may prevent the progress of human glaucoma.38 In this study , we found that the loss of ASK1 prevented the activity of p38 and TNF-induced iNOS production in Muller¨ cells Figure 8 . Recent studies have shown that TNF and NO can induce RGC death and participate in the pathophysiology of glaucoma.39–41 Our results suggest that the ASK1-p38 pathway is involved in the process of TNF-induced RGC degeneration in neighboring glial cells , as well as in the RGC itself Figure 8 .18 Taken together , these findings suggest that such a glial–neuronal network may be functional in various forms of neurodegenerative diseases and that ASK1 , NO , GLAST and trophic factors in Muller ¨ cells have important roles in this network during glaucoma.42,43 Thus , further efforts to discover new compounds that can enhance glutamate uptake and inhibit ASK1 signaling for a prolonged period may lead to the development of novel strategies for the management of glaucoma , including NTG . Materials and Methods Mice . Experiments were carried out using ASK1 , 18 GLAST ? and GLAST mice12,13 in accordance with the Tokyo Metropolitan Institute for Neuroscience Guidelines for the Care and Use of Animals . After mating ASK1 and GLAST mice , GLAST ? ASK1 ? mice were interbred to obtain GLAST ? ASK1 and GLAST ASK1 mice . Histological and morphometric studies . Paraffin retinal sections of 7 mm thickness were cut through the optic nerve and stained with hematoxylin and eosin . RGC number and the extent of retinal degeneration were quantified in three ways.18 First , the thickness of the IRL between the internal limiting membrane and the interface of the outer plexiform layer and the outer nuclear layer was analyzed . Second , in the same sections , the number of neurons in GCL was counted from one ora serrata through the optic nerve to the other ora serrata . Third , RGCs were retrogradely labeled from the superior colliculus with Fluoro-Gold FG Fluorochrome , Englewood , CO , USA . At 7 days after FG application , the eyes were enucleated , and the retinas were detached and prepared as flattened whole mounts in 4 % PFA in 0.1 M PBS solution . The GCL was examined in whole-mounted retinas with fluorescence microscopy to determine RGC density . Four standard areas 0.04 mm2 of each retina at a point 0.1 mm from the optic disc were randomly chosen . Labeled cells were counted by observers blinded to the identity of the mice , and the average number of RGCs mm2 was calculated . The changes in RGC number were expressed as a percentage of the WT control eyes . For detailed morphological analysis , optic nerves were fixed in 2 % glutaraldehyde and 2 % paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer overnight at 41C . After dissection , the pieces of tissue were placed in 1 % osmium tetroxide , and after dehydration , the pieces were embedded in Epon Nisshin EM , Tokyo , Japan . Transverse semi-thin 1 mm sections were stained with 0.2 % toluidine blue in 1.0 % sodium borate.13,44 IOP measurement . IOP was measured by a previously validated commercial rebound tonometer TonoLab Colonial Medical Supply , Franconia , NH , USA in anesthetized mice as reported previously.45 To minimize variation , the data were collected during a time window 4–6 min after injection of the anesthetic during which IOP plateaus . The animals were 6 months of age , and their body weights ranged from 22–36 g at the time of IOP measurement . As the 24-h IOP pattern in mouse eyes is biphasic , with IOP being highest around 2100 hours , 19 we examined IOP between 2000 and 2300 hours . mfERG . Mice 3 months old were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of a mixture of xylazine 10 mg kg and ketamine 25 mg kg . The pupils were dilated with 0.5 % phenylephrine hydrochloride and 0.5 % tropicamide . mfERGs were recorded using a VERIS 6.0 system Electro-Diagnostic Imaging , Redwood City , CA , USA . The visual stimulus consisted of seven hexagonal areas scaled with eccentricity . The stimulus array was displayed on a high-resolution black and white monitor driven at a frame rate of 100 Hz . The second-order kernel , which is impaired in patients with glaucoma , was analyzed.13,44 Malondialdehyde and glutathione assay . The concentrations of malondialdehyde and glutathione were measured using the Bioxytech LPO-586 Oxis Research , Beverly Hills , CA , USA and Glutathione Assay Kit Cayman Chemical , Ann Arbor , MI , USA , according to the manufacturers’ protocols . Glutamate uptake assay . Glutamate uptake assay in primary cultured Muller ¨ cells was carried out as previously reported.20,31 Muller ¨ cells were cultured in 5.5 mM glucose-containing DMEM supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum . The culture media were replaced with a modified Hanks’ balanced salt solution HBSS for a 20-min preincubation , before the addition of 0.025 mCi ml L- [ 3H ] -glutamate Amersham , Uppsala , Sweden and 100 mM unlabeled glutamate to the media . Uptake was terminated after 7 min by three washes in ice-cold HBSS , immediately followed by cell lysis in 0.1 M NaOH . Aliquots were taken for scintillation counting , and protein concentration was determined using BSA standards . Immunoblot analysis . Primary Muller ¨ cells were obtained as previously reported35–37 and treated with TNF at various concentrations for 20 min or 16 h . Immunoblotting was carried out as previously reported.20,31 Membranes were incubated with antibodies against p38 1 1000 BD Biosciences Pharmingen , San Diego , CA , USA , phospho-p38 1 1000 BD Biosciences Pharmingen or iNOS 1 1000 BD Biosciences Pharmingen . Assessment of TNF-induced cell death in cultured RGCs . RGCs derived form WT and ASK1 mice were seeded at a density of 5 104 cells per well and cultured with 0.1 ml of medium on a 96-well culture plate.18 After 2 days , they were stimulated with 400 ng ml of TNF for 2 days , and dying RGC number was counted after staining with propidium iodide .

20489731	www.nature.com cdd Macrophage colony-stimulating factor M-CSF , also known as CSF-1 is the primary cytokine for cells of the mononuclear phagocyte lineage such as monocytes , macrophages and osteoclasts , and regulates their development and effector functions.1,2 A unique receptor , Fms , the proto-oncogene c-fms products and receptor tyrosine kinase , mediates the biological effects of M-CSF.3,4 The binding of M-CSF induces the dimerization and activation of the tyrosine kinase activity of Fms.3,4 This leads to the autophosphorylation of specific tyrosine residues in the Fms cytoplasmic domain and the subsequent interaction of the phosphorylated tyrosine resi-dues with other signaling proteins , which initiates signaling along specific pathways.3–5 The essential role of the M-CSF Fms axis in the mononuclear phagocyte lineage has been well established using naturally occurring M-CSF-deficient op op mice6,7 and Fms knockout mice.8 Both mice have low body weight , low growth rate and skeletal abnormalities , and are toothless and deficient in most tissue macrophages.6–8 Importantly , Lin et al.9 recently identified interleukin-34 IL-34 as the second and functional ligand for Fms . First , they expressed B3400 human-secreted proteins , tested their activity in 30 different assays and identified a protein that supported the survival of human peripheral blood monocytes . The protein was a hypothetical protein in the public database C16orf77 and designated as IL-34 . IL-34 mRNA is widely expressed in tissues , including heart , brain , lung , liver , kidney , thymus and spleen.9 Next , they screened their library of extracellular domains of transmembrane proteins to block the activity of IL-34 on monocytes and identified Fms as a possible receptor of IL-34 . Indeed , the binding of biotinylated IL-34 to human monocytic THP-1 cells was blocked by anti-Fms antibody or M-CSF , 9 confirming that IL-34 and M-CSF shared Fms as the receptor . Such alternative ligand has not been identified for Kit and Flt3 , the hematopoietic receptor tyrosine kinases that are structurally closely related to Fms . In non-hematopoietic systems , there are several precedents of multiple ligands for a single receptor tyrosine kinase , for example , platelet-derived growth factors and their recep-tors.10 However , in quite contrast to these ligand-receptor systems , M-CSF and IL-34 shared no homology in their amino-acid sequences.9 Thus , it is possible to predict that IL-34 and M-CSF are different in their biological activity and signaling , which would provide a clue to understand the physiological significance why two ligands exist for Fms . IL-34 is shown to support the survival of human peripheral blood monocytes and promote the formation of macrophage colonies in human bone marrow cell cultures.9 However , it remains to be analyzed whether the phenotype and function of macrophages differentiated by IL-34 are identical to those by M-CSF . It also remains to be analyzed whether the pattern , kinetics and strength of signal activation by IL-34 are identical to those by M-CSF . Macrophages comprise a heterogeneous population of cells , and it is thought that their function phenotype are regulated by coordinated actions of different classes of cytokines.2,11–14 If the macrophages differentiated by IL-34 have some sort of difference from those by M-CSF in their phenotype and signaling , it would mean that the regulation of macrophage phenotype function is more com-plicated than thought , even at the single receptor level . Here , we provide the first evidence that these two ligands for Fms , IL-34 and M-CSF , indeed resemble but are not necessarily identical in their biological activity and signal activation . Results Bioactivity of IL-34 is not necessarily identical to that of M-CSF . Recombinant human rh IL-34 promoted the survival of human peripheral blood monocytes in a dose-dependent manner , the degree of which was similar to that by rhM-CSF Figure 1a . IL-34 and M-CSF often induced macrophages with different morphologies Figure 1b . In donor 1 upper panels but not in donor 2 lower panels , the culture with IL-34 contained less fibroblast-like elongated macrophages indicated by arrows , which are charac-teristics of M-CSF-macrophages.11,12 The percentage of fibroblast-like elongated macrophages in IL-34-culture was lower than that in M-CSF-culture , in most if not all donors tested Figure 1b . The level of CD54 adhesion molecule was lower , but on the contrary , that of HLA-DR major histocompatibility complex class II was higher in IL-34-macrophages Figure 1c . The replication of HIV-1 viruses tended to be higher in IL-34-macrophages Figure 1d . However , all these differences were quite slight . Moreover , the levels of cell-surface molecules such as CD14 , CD16 , Table 1 Differences and similarities between M-CSF-and IL-34-macrophages Phenotype macrophages macrophages CD11b integrin aM , CD18 integrin b2 , CD29 integrin b1 , CD49d integrin a4 , CD163 scavenger receptor , CD204 scavenger receptor or CD86 costimulatory molecule were the same between these two macrophages , and their ability of phagocytosis of Escherichia coli was comparable data not shown . Nevertheless , the ability of these two macrophages to produce chemokines was distinct . The amount of MCP-1 was lower , but on the contrary , the amount of eotaxin-2 was higher in IL-34-macrophages , which was observed in all four donors tested Figure 1e . The difference and similarity in phenotypes between two macrophages observed in this study are summarized in Table 1 . We next performed assays with a human cell line , TF-1-fms , which was previously established by expressing human Fms into TF-1 cells.15 Because TF-1 cells require granulocyte-macrophage GM -CSF for their growth but lack the expression of Fms , 16 neither M-CSF nor IL-34 stimulated the growth of TF-1 cells data not shown . In contrast , both cytokines stimulated the growth of TF-1-fms cells Figure 2a , which was abolished by the Fms kinase inhibitor GW258017 Figure 2b . Thus , Fms mediated the activity of both cytokines to TF-1-fms cells . Importantly , the morphology of the cells was distinct between the two cultures . rhM-CSF-cultured TF-1-fms cells formed many large aggregates but such large aggre-gates were few in rhIL-34-cultured cells Figure 2c , left panels and bar graph . The morphological difference was not due to contaminants in the recombinant proteins , if any , as this was observed even when the supernatants of transfected 293T cells were used as a source of M-CSF or IL-34 Figure 2c , right panels . We also performed bioassays with mouse cells . As human IL-34 did not bind mouse Fms unlike human M-CSF see Figure 8a , we used recombinant mouse rm IL-34 , and rhM-CSF as a reference . The ability of IL-34 to promote the survival of peritoneal macrophages was comparable to that of M-CSF Figure 3a , and the ability of IL-34 to stimulate the growth of bone marrow progenitor cells Figure 3b or M-NFS-60 cells Figure 3c was slightly weaker than that of M-CSF . Importantly , in contrast to these results , the difference in their ability to induce cell migration was obvious . As shown Figure 3d , IL-34 had a markedly weaker ability to induce the migration of J774A.1 cells . The ability of IL-34 at a higher concentration 250 ng ml was still weaker than that of M-CSF at 100 ng ml Figure 3d . Altogether , our bioassays showed that the biological activity of IL-34 indeed resembled but were not necessarily identical to that of M-CSF . In most assays , IL-34 and M-CSF showed the equivalent ability to support cell growth or survival . However , they were different in the ability to induce the production of chemokines such as MCP-1 and eotaxin-2 in primary macrophages , the morphological change in TF-1-fms cells and the migration of J774A.1 cells . Signal activation by IL-34 is not necessarily identical to that by M-CSF . To clarify the molecular basis by which IL-34 and M-CSF differently regulate cellular phenotype , we compared the steady-state signal activation status in IL-34-macrophages to that in M-CSF-macrophages . To simultaneously assess the phosphorylation status of various kinases and signaling molecules , we used a dot blot array Figure 4a . As summarized Figure 4b , the levels of MAP kinases MAPK phosphorylation were slightly higher in IL-34-macrophages donor 1 or comparable between the two macrophages donor 2 . When analyzed by western blotting , we found no obvious difference in the strength kinetics of ERK activation between M-CSF-and IL-34-stimulated macrophages during the first 30 min after stimulation data not shown . Nevertheless , those of ribosomal S6 kinases and Stat proteins were lower in IL-34-macrophages , in both donors , albeit slightly Figure 4 . To prove more convincingly that IL-34 and M-CSF elicit different signal activation , we next used human myeloid TF-1-fms cells as a model , because the morphology of the cells cultured with IL-34 was distinct from that with M-CSF Figure 2c . We found two obvious differences in the overall protein tyrosine phosphorylation between IL-34-and M-CSF-stimulated TF-1-fms cells Figure 5a , a strong but transient phosphorylation of several proteins by IL-34 indicated by asterisks and a rapid decline of phosphorylation of other several proteins by IL-34 indicated by arrows . The latter correlated well with a rapid downregulation of Fms in cells treated with IL-34 Figure 5b . Importantly , the transiently strong but rapid decline of phosphorylation by IL-34 was also observed with Fms itself Figure 5c . When activated , Fms phosphorylates its own tyrosine residues such as Tyr708 , Tyr723 and Tyr809 , which triggers the interaction of the activated Fms with downstream signaling molecules.1,3,4 As summarized Figure 5d , IL-34 phosphorylated these and other residues Tyr546 and Tyr699 more strongly than M-CSF at 1 min of stimulation upper panel . The difference in Tyr546 was more obvious than that in other tyrosines . However , these signals by IL-34 declined more rapidly and became weaker than those by M-CSF at 15 min of stimulation lower panel . The difference in Tyr546 , Tyr699 and Tyr723 was more obvious than that in other tyrosines . The transiently strong but rapid decline of phosphorylation by IL-34 was also observed with focal adhesion kinase FAK and an adaptor protein p66Shc Figure 6 , both of which were shown to be phosphorylated by M-CSF.18,19 The rapid decline of phos-phorylation was also obvious with p52Shc isoform Figure 6 . Collectively , these results indicated that IL-34 temporarily activated Fms and downstream pathways more strongly than M-CSF , but those signals were terminated more quickly due to the rapid Fms downregulation . Possible difference in domains of Fms that IL-34 and M-CSF bind . Mutagenesis studies for M-CSF showed that as few as first 148 amino acids were sufficient for its activity , 7 cysteine residues in the active domains formed three intrachain bonds and one interchain bond , and all these disulfide bonds were essential for its activity.20–22 Moreover , despite a lack of appreciable sequence homology , M-CSF , SCF the ligand for Kit and Flt3L the ligand for Flt3 had at least three conserved cysteines in their active domains , which implicated structurally equivalent part of these cytokines in receptor recognition.23 Thus , to gain an insight into the difference in the signaling events between IL-34 and M-CSF , we determined the domain of IL-34 required for its activity and compared the number and position of cysteines in the active domains of IL-34 with those of M-CSF . As shown by the DC60 mutant Figures 7a and b , the C-terminal 60 amino acids , which contained two cysteines , 9 were dispensable for IL-34 to stimulate the growth of TF-1-fms cells . The apparent weak activity of DC60 to stimulate the growth of the cells was due to its low expression see Figure 7a . Further deletion of C terminus resulted in abortive expression of mutant IL-34 proteins data not shown . As shown Figure 7c , the position of cysteines was less conserved between the active domains of IL-34 and those of M-CSF . Moreover , two out of three cysteines , which were conserved among M-CSF , SCF and Flt3L indicated by shaded boxes , 23 were not found in IL-34 . These results raised a possibility that IL-34 and M-CSF were different in receptor recognition . To test this possibility , we used the flow cytometry-based ligand binding analysis , 24 in which target cells were sequentially incubated with Flag-tagged human IL-34 or human M-CSF , biotin-labeled anti-Flag antibody and PE-labeled streptavidin . In this analysis , the fluorescence Figure 3 Activity of IL-34 on mouse cells . a and b Peritoneal cells and femoral bone marrow BM cells , both of which were obtained from Balb C mice , were seeded at 1 105 and 1 106 cells per ml , respectively , and cultured with indicated concentrations of rhM-CSF or rmIL-34 for 3 days . The cultures were replaced with fresh complete media and incubated for another 3 days . The survival or growth of these cells was monitored using MTT assay . Results were shown as the mean±S.D. of triplicate assays . c M-NFS-60 cells were seeded at 1 104 cells per ml and cultured with rhM-CSF or rmIL-34 for 3 days . The growth of these cells was monitored using MTT assay . Results were shown as the mean±S.D. of triplicate assays . d The migration of J774A.1 cells was measured using a transmigration chamber assay with 8 mm pore size inserts . rhM-CSF or rmIL-34 was added to wells at the indicated concentrations . The number of J774A.1 cells migrated through the inserts was monitored using MTT assay . Results were shown as the mean±S.D. of triplicate assays . a–d Data shown are representative of two independent experiments with similar results . *Po0.01 signal was observed with Fms-positive TF-1-fms cells but not with Fms-negative TF-1 cells Figure 8a . Moreover , in agreement with the finding that human M-CSF , but not human IL-34 , stimulated the growth of mouse Fms-positive M-NFS-60 cells data not shown , the fluorescence signal was observed only when the cells were incubated with M-CSF-Flag Figure 8a . Thus , the observed signal indeed reflected the specific binding of these Flag-tagged ligands . Using this system , we first confirmed that purified rhIL-34 inhibited the binding of M-CSF-Flag to TF-1-fms cells and vice versa Figure 8b . We also confirmed that an anti-Fms monoclonal antibody MAb clone 12-2D625 inhibited both the binding of M-CSF-Flag to TF-1-fms cells and the binding of IL-34-Flag to the cells Figure 8c , upper panels . Another anti-Fms MAb clone 2-4A525 inhibited the M-CSF-Flag binding more efficiently than the MAb clone 12-2D6 lower left panel . However and of importance , the 2-4A5 clone did not inhibit the IL-34-Flag binding to TF-1-fms cells at all lower right panel . Consistent with the result , the clone 2-4A5 completely inhibited the growth of TF-1-fms cells by M-CSF but not by IL-34 data not shown . These results suggested that IL-34 and M-CSF bound overlapping but different domains of Fms . Taken all together , our present study showed that IL-34 and M-CSF indeed resembled but were not necessarily identical in their biological activity and signal activation kinetics strength , which might be caused by the difference in their structure , Fms domains that they bound and the rate of Fms downregulation . Macrophages comprise a heterogeneous population of cells with various phenotypes and functions , which are distinctly regulated by cytokines such as M-CSF and GM-CSF . Indeed , macrophages derived from these cytokines showed marked differences in the morphology , the ability to support HIV-1 replication and the production of cytokine or chemokine.2,11–14 These differences are basically due to the difference in the structure of their receptors.2 In this study , we showed that macrophage phenotype and function were differently regu-lated even at the level of the single receptor Fms , by using IL-34 and M-CSF . We showed that IL-34-macrophages and M-CSF-macro-phages were not necessarily identical in their phenotype or function . The replication of HIV-1 tended to be higher in IL-34-macrophages Figure 1d , which was consistent with the finding that the levels of MAPK phosphorylation were slightly higher in IL-34-macrophages or comparable between two macrophages Figure 4 , as the activation of MAPK pathway was required for HIV-1 replication.26 The notable difference was the production of chemokines . IL-34-macro-phages produced lesser MCP-1 but more eotaxin-2 than M-CSF-macrophages Figure 1e . The lesser MCP-1 produc-tion might be due to the lower phosphorylation of Stat family proteins in IL-34-macrophages Figure 4b , as the activation of Stat was required for the expression of MCP-1.27,28 Given that chemokines have a crucial role in immune and inflammatory reactions29 and thus their expression should be tightly regulated , 30 our result implies that IL-34 and M-CSF are differently involved in those reactions . Using cultured cell lines , we further showed that IL-34 and M-CSF differently regulated cellular phenotypes . The most notable differences were the migration of J774A.1 cells Figure 3d and the morphology of TF-1-fms cells Figure 2c , which was likely to be due to a differential regulation of the reorganization of actin cytoskeleton or the expression of adhesion molecules . These results may also support the idea that these cytokines are differently involved in immune and inflammatory reactions , as the recruitment of macrophages at specific sites is important in achieving a localized and efficient reaction . It is well known that the rate of downregulation of receptor tyrosine kinases , which associates with their endocytosis , 31 regulates the signal kinetics or strength . For instance , macrophages obtained from mice lacking Cbl , a ubiquitin ligase that targets Fms to the endocytic machinery , 32,33 exhibited a delayed downregulation of Fms , a prolonged tyrosine phosphorylation of Fms and downstream molecules , and an enhanced growth response to M-CSF.34–36 In this study , we showed that IL-34 temporarily activated Fms and downstream pathways more strongly than M-CSF Figures 5a , c and 6 , but those signals were terminated more quickly due to the rapid Fms downregulation Figure 5b . Thus , it is reasonable to conclude that this difference in the earliest signaling events leads to the observed cellular phenotypic differences . The rapid termination of signal might explain why the steady-state signal activation status was generally low in IL-34-macrophages Figure 4 . Among the autophosphorylation sites of Fms , Tyr546 was the most typical site showing the strong but transient phosphorylation upon IL-34-stimulation Figures 5c and d . However , signaling molecules that interact with this site have not been identified yet.1,4,37 The identification of such molecules will facilitate the understanding of signaling cascades unique to IL-34 . Using Biacore analysis , Lin et al.9 previously showed that M-CSF and IL-34 bound the extracellular domain of Fms with a Kd of 34 pM and about 1 pM , respectively , which appeared to explain our finding that the inhibition of M-CSF-Fms binding by IL-34 was more effective than the inhibition of IL-34-Fms binding by M-CSF Figure 8b . Our results also suggested the difference in the disulfide bond formation between IL-34 and M-CSF Figure 7c and Fms domains that they recognized Figure 8c . Thus , it was highly likely that IL-34 and M-CSF bound overlapping but different domains of Fms with different affinities , and thereby elicited the different Fms activation kinetics and strength . This idea should be further confirmed by determining the crystal structure of the complex between IL-34 and Fms , as done with M-CSF-Fms complex.38 rmIL-34 showed the marked weak activity in the migration of J774A.1 cells Figure 3d . The weak in vitro activity of mouse IL-34 was apparently consistent with the finding that overall phenotypes of M-CSF-deficient op op mice and Fms knockout mice were quite similar , although the osteopetrosis in femurs and the depletion of macrophages in kidney were slightly severe in Fms knockout mice.8 However , the activity of human IL-34 was not always weaker than that of M-CSF , as shown in this study . Thus , in vivo role of IL-34 may be different between mice and humans . In summary , we showed that two ligands for Fms , IL-34 and M-CSF , indeed resembled but were not necessarily identical in their biological activity and signal activation . In other words , we showed that macrophage phenotype and function were Figure 6 Tyrosine phosphorylation of downstream molecules . a TF-1-fms cells were M-CSF-depleted for 14 h and then stimulated with 100 ng ml rhM-CSF or 100 ng ml rhIL-34 for the indicated periods at 371C . The total cell lysates were subjected to western blotting . Antibodies used were as follows anti-phosphorylated FAK Tyr576 577 , anti-FAK total , anti-phosphorylated Shc Tyr239 240 and anti-Shc total . b The profiles , which were created by quantifying the band pixel densities on a , were shown . a and b Data shown are representative of three independent experiments with similar results differentially regulated even at the level of the single receptor Fms . Moreover , our study provided a new example showing that cellular response to cytokines was tightly regulated by the rate of receptor downregulation and the kinetics strength of receptor activation . However , it is still unclear why these functionally different ligands exist for Fms . For the reason mentioned above , it may be difficult to apply results obtained from studies with mice , for example IL-34 knockout mice , to gain insights into the role of IL-34 in humans . Thus , it is important to analyze the steady-state in vivo level of IL-34 proteins and its alteration in various human disorders . More functional assays as well as comprehensive transcriptional profiling analyses11,39 are also needed to fully understand the phenotype , function and signaling of IL-34-macrophages .

Mononuclear cells obtained using LSM reagent MP Biomedicals , Solon , OH , USA were suspended into RPMI 1640 medium-1 % FCS at 1 106 cells per ml and seeded into multiwell plates . Monocytes were enriched by adherence to plates for 1 h at 371C , and non-adherent cells were removed by extensive washing with PBS . Then , the adherent monocytes were differentiated into macrophages by culturing with RPMI 1640-10 % FCS containing either rhIL-34 or rhM-CSF . After 3 days , the cultures were replaced with fresh complete media and incubated for another 3 days . The purity of the day 6-macrophages prepared by this method was routinely more than 95 % when assessed by the expression of CD14 , as reported previously.16 The number of macrophages was monitored using MTT reagent Sigma , St Louis , MO , USA .

Detection was performed with HRP-labeled secondary antibodies GE Healthcare and the ECL Plus Western Blotting System . The intensity of bands on scanned film images was quantified using Quantity One software . Fms downregulation . The downregulation of the cell-surface Fms upon IL-34 or M-CSF binding was determined by flow cytometry on a FACSCalibur . TF-1-fms cells maintained with rhM-CSF were M-CSF-depleted for 6 h , and then left untreated or treated with 100 ng ml rhIL-34 or 100 ng ml rhM-CSF for 10 or 90 min at 371C .

The staining and washing steps were carried out on ice . We selected the clone 3-4A4 for Fms staining , as the clone inhibited neither IL-34-Fms nor M-CSF-Fms binding Chihara T and Suzu S , unpublished results . Preparation of Flag-tagged IL-34 and M-CSF . In this study , we prepared human IL-34 proteins with Flag tag sequence DYKDDDDK at its C terminus IL-34-Flag for the ligand binding analysis see below . Human M-CSF-Flag was prepared as described previously.24 Using the full-length IL-34 cDNA obtained by PCR as a template , we prepared IL-34-Flag cDNA also by PCR . To determine the active domain of IL-34 , we further prepared Flag-tagged mutant IL-34 cDNAs that lacked C-terminal 20 , 40 and 60 amino acids DC20 , DC40 and DC60 see Figure 7a . The PCR primers used were as follows 50-GGGGACGAGGAACACCACCAT-30 the common upstream primer , 50-ATCCGCAGTCACCATCCAGGG-30 for the full-length IL-34 , 50-TTCATTTATC ATCATCATCTTTATAATCGGGCAAGAGGCC-30 for the full-length IL-34-Flag , 50-CCTATTTATCGTCGTCATCTTTGTAGTCCGTGGAGTGAGG-30 for the IL-34-DC20-Flag , 50-CCTACTTGTCGTCGTCGTCCTTATAATCATACTGCAATGA-30 for the IL-34-DC40-Flag and 50-CTCATTTATCATCATCATCTTTATAATCGCTTT GTTTACA-30 for the IL-34-DC60-Flag . The PCR products were cloned into pCR2.1 vector Invitrogen and the nucleotide sequences were verified using a BigDye Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit Applied Biosystems , Foster City , CA , USA and ABI PRISM 3100 Genetic Analyzer Applied Biosystems . The insert cDNAs were subcloned into pcDNA3.1 expression vector Invitrogen , and the expression plasmids were transfected into 293T cells using Lipofectamine 2000 as described previously.16,24 The supernatants collected after 2 days were analyzed for the expression of Flag-tagged proteins by western blotting with anti-Flag antibody clone M2 Sigma and the activity to stimulate the growth of TF-1-fms cells , or subjected to the ligand binding analysis . The sequence alignment was performed using the ClustalW algorithm.43 Ligand binding and competition analyses . The binding of IL-34-Flag or M-CSF-Flag proteins to hematopoietic cell lines was assessed by the flow cytometry-based analysis.24 Before assay , the supernatants of transfected 293T cells were analyzed for the amount of IL-34-Flag or M-CSF-Flag proteins by western blotting with anti-Flag M2 antibody , and appropriately diluted with DMEM medium-10 % FCS . TF-1 cells maintained with rhGM-CSF , and TF-1-fms and M-NFS-60 cells maintained with rhM-CSF were factor-depleted in RPMI 1640-10 % FCS for 6 h at 371C . The factor-depleted cells were first incubated with the diluted 293T cell supernatants on ice for 20 min . After washing twice with chilled PBS-1 % BSA , the cells were then incubated with biotin-labeled anti-Flag M2 antibody 10 mg ml in PBS-1 % BSA for 20 min on ice . After washing as above , the cells were finally incubated with PE-labeled streptavidin 5 mg ml Pharmingen for 20 min on ice , and analyzed on a FACSCalibur .

After ligand binding , Notch proteins are activated by a series of cleavages that release its intracellular domain Notch-IC , followed by its nuclear translocation.3 The nuclear translocation of Notch-IC results in the transcriptional activation of genes of the HESs family [ Hes E spl family ] and HEYs family Hesr Hey family through the interaction of Notch-IC with CSL CBF1 recom-bining binding protein suppressor of hairless RBP-Jk in vertebrates , Suppressor of Hairless [ SuH ] in Drosophila melanogaster , Lag-1 in Caenorhabditis elegans , and through mastermind-like MAML .2,3 In the absence of the Notch-IC , RBP-Jk acts as a transcriptional repressor because of its ability to bind transcriptional corepressors and histone deacetylase-1 . Notch-IC translocates to the nucleus in which it interacts with the RBP-Jk and displaces corepressor complexes and recruits coactivators , thus turning RBP-Jk into a transcriptional activator.4 c-Jun N-terminal kinase JNK -interacting protein-1 JIP1 was first identified as a scaffold for JNK signaling from a yeast two-hybrid screen , facilitating mixed-lineage kinase Hong1 , J Jung1 , Y-H Choi1 , J-H Yoon1 , S-M Kim1 , E-J Choi3 , MLK -dependent JNK signal transduction by aggregating the three components of the module , MLK , MKK7 , and JNK , on different regions of JIP1.5,6 JIP proteins can form homo-and hetero-oligomeric complexes with components of the JNK signaling pathway . In addition , JIP1 interacts with Alzheimer’s amyloid precursor protein , 7 p190rhoGEF , 8 light chain of kinesin , 9 apolipoprotein E receptor 2,10 T-lymphokine-acti-vated killer cell-originated protein kinase , 11 the vaccinia virus B1R kinase , 12 vaccinia-related kinase-2,13 protein kinase B Akt , 14 Src family kinase , 15 TGF-b-activated kinase-1,16 and the intracellular domain of Notch1 Notch1-IC .17 The inter-action of JIP1 with a variety of proteins suggests that JIP1 serves as a multifunctional protein . We earlier showed that Notch1-IC , an active form of Notch1 generated by the action of g-secretase , functions as a negative regulator of JNK signaling by disrupting the scaffold function of JIP1.17 Despite these observations , the precise mechanisms underlying the connection between Notch and JIP1-JNK signaling pathways remain to be accurately delineated . Therefore , in this study , we evaluated the mole-cular basis of the signal cross-talk occurring between them . JIP1 suppresses Notch1-IC-mediated signaling through disruption of the Notch1–RBP-Jk complex . Interestingly , the down-regulation of Notch1 signaling was found to be the consequence of the cytoplasmic retention of RBP-Jk through physical interaction with JIP1 . Furthermore , we found that the ectopic expression of RBP-Jk inhibited JIP1-mediated activation of JNK1 signaling and cell death induced by glucose deprivation . Collectively , our findings show that there is feedback regulation between the Notch1–RBP-Jk and JIP1-JNK pathways through protein–protein interaction and there-by regulate cell-fate decisions , differentiation , proliferation , and cell death and survival . Results JIP1 suppresses the Notch1 signaling pathway . We have earlier shown that Notch1-IC suppresses the JIP1-mediated JNK signaling cascade and cell death through physical association.17 Inversely , to determine whether JIP1 is involved in the regulation of Notch1 signaling , a transcriptional reporter assay was performed using Notch1-dependent promoter elements linked to the luciferase gene . The Notch1-IC-induced luciferase reporter activity was inhibited by the cotransfection of JIP1 in HEK293 Figure 1a and NIH3T3 cells Figure 1b . To determine the function of endogenous JIP1 in Notch1 signaling , we performed a transcription reporter assay using JIP1 wild-type JIP1 ? ? and JIP1-deficient JIP1 fibroblast cells . The transcriptional activity of Notch1-IC in JIP1-deficient fibroblasts was threefold higher than in JIP1 wild-type cells Figure 1c . We also found that Notch1-IC transcriptional activity was suppressed by overexpressed JIP1 in JIP1-deficient cells Figure 1d . These results indicated that JIP1 suppresses the transcriptional activity of Notch1 in intact cells . JIP1 prevents physical association between Notch1-IC and RBP-Jk . Our further findings indicated that the JIP1-induced suppression of Notch1 activity was not significantly correlated with the inhibition of the g-secretase-dependent proteolytic cleavage of the active Notch1 mutant DEN1 to Notch1-IC Figure 2a . In addition , the steady state protein level of DEN1 and Notch1-IC were not diminished in these cases Figure 2a , suggesting that , at least in part , the JIP1-induced inhibition of Notch1 can be linked neither to the regulation of cleavage patterns , nor to protein stability . To determine the effects of JIP1 on the molecular interactions occurring between Notch1-IC and RBP-Jk , coimmuno-precipitation was conducted in HEK293 cells after the cotransfection of vector encoding Myc-tagged Notch1-IC , Flag-tagged RBP-Jk , and HA-tagged JIP1 . The results indicated that JIP1 interrupts the physical association between Notch1-IC and RBP-Jk Figure 2b and c . To further substantiate this finding , coimmunoprecipitations were performed in JIP1 wild-type and JIP1-deficient fibro-blast cells . Endogenous binding between Notch1-IC and RBP-Jk in JIP1-deficient fibroblasts was much higher than in JIP1 wild-type cells Figure 2d . These results suggest that JIP1 may negatively regulate the transactivation of Notch1-IC target genes , through the suppression of the interaction between Notch1-IC and RBP-Jk in intact cells . fold 8 6 R.L.U fold 40 30 R.L.U JIP1 sequesters RBP-JK in the cytoplasm . Notch1-IC and RBP-Jk are localized mainly in the nucleus , and as shown in Figure 3a , the intracellular distribution of JIP1 is in the cytoplasm . To determine the effect of JIP1 on Notch1-IC and RBP-Jk localization , cells were cotransfected with vector encoding HA-JIP1 , Flag-RBP-Jk , and Myc-Notch1-IC . The expression of JIP1 significantly blocked the translocation of RBP-Jk into the nucleus and about 90 % of RBP-Jk remained in the cytoplasm Figure 3a . However , JIP1 did not affect the cellular localization of Notch1-IC , which was distributed in the nucleus . We found similar results using JIP1 knockout cell lines . The overexpression of JIP1 in the JIP1 cells prohibited nuclear accumulation of RBP-Jk Figure 3b . The results of this experiment suggest that the inhibitory function of JIP1 in the Notch1 signaling pathway is mediated by regulating RBP-Jk subcellular localization . JIP1 interacts with RBP-Jk and Notch1-IC and forms a trimetric complex . Earlier we have shown that JIP1 may interact with Notch1-IC , 17 and Notch1-IC was mainly present in the nucleus and moderately present in the cytoplasm.17–19 To delineate more precisely the manner in which JIP1 prevents Notch1-IC and RBP-Jk-mediated transcription , we conducted a series of in vitro binding and coimmuno-precipitation experiments . In the in vitro binding studies , an interaction between GST-RBP-Jk and JIP1 was detected on the bead complexes Figure 4a . To further characterize the physical interaction occurring between JIP1 and RBP-Jk , coimmunoprecipitation was conducted in the HEK293 cells through the cotransfection of vector encoding Flag-RBP-Jk or HA-JIP1 . The results indicated that JIP1 interacts with RBP-Jk Figure 4b . In addition , using cytoplasmic fraction of mouse brain extract , PC12 cells and SH-SY5Y cells , we found endogenous binding not only between Notch1-IC and JIP1 , but also between RBP-Jk and JIP1 Figure 4c . Furthermore , we also confirm the endogenous binding between these proteins using JIP1 ? ? , JIP1 , and JIP1 introduced JIP1 cells Figure 4d . From these results , we could postulate that JIP1 forms a trimeric complex with Notch1-IC and RBP-Jk . To confirm this , HEK293 cells were cotransfected with vectors encoding Myc-Notch1-IC , Flag-RBP-Jk , and HA-JIP1 , and were then subjected to coimmunoprecipitation analysis using cytoplasmic fraction of cell lysates . Immunoblot analysis revealed that JIP1 formed a trimeric complex with Notch1-IC and RBP-Jk Figure 4e . Next , we examined whether endogenous JIP1 could form a trimeric complex in cytoplasmic fraction of mouse brain extracts . Immunoblot analysis indicated the trimeric formation of endogenous JIP1 , Notch1-IC , and RBP-Jk Figure 4f . In the trimeric complex , we questioned whether JIP1 could bind RBP-Jk without Notch1-IC , or whether JIP1 could bind Notch1-IC without RBP-Jk . To examine this question , we used Notch1-IC-DRAM , which is unable to interact with RBP-Jk . JIP1 still formed complexes with Notch1-IC-DRAM and RBP-Jk , suggesting that JIP1 can bind separately to Notch1-IC and RBP-Jk through perhaps different domains Figure 4g . Taken together , JIP1 could bind both Notch1-IC and RBP-Jk in the cytoplasm without competition and finally RBP-Jk accumulated in the cytoplasm , but Notch1-IC move into the nucleus under unknown mechanism . C-terminal region of JIP1 including the Src homology 3 domain is critical for binding to the proline-rich region of RBP-Jk . To address which domain of JIP1 might have an important function in the binding and suppression of Notch1 signaling , we performed an in vitro binding and coimmuno-precipitation assay using several deletion mutants Figure 5c . In our earlier report , it was shown that Notch1-IC could bind to the JNK-binding domain JBD domain of JIP1 and thereby suppress JIP1-mediated JNK1 signaling pathway.17 Here , we investigated which of the domains might be involved in the interaction of JIP1 and RBP-Jk . In vitro binding analysis with GST-fused RBP-Jk revealed Flag-RBP-Jk HA-JIP1 IP Flag SH-SY5Y JIP1 -- that amino-acids 292–518 , including the Src homology 3 SH3 domain of JIP1 , was required for binding to RBP-Jk Figure 5a . A subsequent coimmunoprecipitation experi-ment also showed that amino-acids 292–518 of JIP1 , including SH3 domain , were important for binding to RBP-Jk Figure 5b . Therefore , we could suggest that Notch1-IC interacts with the JBD domain of JIP1 and RBP-Jk interacts with C-terminal domain of JIP1 including SH3 domain Figure 5c . We then assessed the inhibition of Notch1 activity by the JIP1 deletion mutants , JIP1-DJBD , JIP-JBD , and JIP1-phosphotyrosine interaction domain PID . We found that JIP1-DJBD were able to suppress Notch1-IC-mediated transactivation of the 4XCSL luciferase reporter system Figure 5d . The PID domain of JIP1 did not participate in binding or suppression of the Notch1 signaling pathway Figure 5d . Earlier reports have shown that RBP-Jk contains a poly-proline region , which can serve as a docking site to SH3 domains.20 To address the possible region of RBP-Jk that binds to JIP1 , we performed the site-directed mutation of poly-proline to alanine within RBP-Jk amino-acids 95–97 . The physical association occurring between JIP1 and RBP-Jk was diminished by the proline to alanine mutation Figure 5e . Furthermore , JIP1 did not alter the RBP-Jk PPP AAA mutant and Notch1-IC-mediated transactivation Figure 5f . Next , we examined the effect of JIP1 on the subcellular localization of RBP-Jk and RBP-JK PPP AAA mutant . The expression of JIP1 significantly blocked the translocation of RBP-Jk into the nucleus . However , JIP1 did not affect the cellular localization of RBP-Jk PPP AAA mutant , which was distributed in the nucleus Figure 5g . The overexpression of JIP1 and JIP1-DJBD prohibited nuclear accumulation of RBP-Jk Figure 5h . Taken together , these data suggest that the physical interaction between SH3 domain of JIP1 and the proline-rich domain of RBP-Jk sequesters RBP-Jk in the cytoplasm and is an important mechanism by which JIP1 suppresses Notch1-IC activation . RBP-Jk prevents JIP1-mediated signaling and cell death . JIP1 physically associates with MLK3 , MKK7 , and JNK , and thus functions as a scaffold protein that facili-tates JNK activation by the MLK3–MKK7–JNK signaling module.6,21,22 To characterize further the mechanism under-lying the action of RBP-Jk on the JIP1 pathway , we examined whether RBP-Jk affects JIP1-mediated activation of JNK . Coexpression of JIP1 increased the kinase activity of ectopic JNK1 in HEK293 cells that had been cotransfected with vectors for MLK3 , MKK7 , and JNK1 Figure 6a . This scaffold function of JIP1 was inhibited by RBP-Jk . We then examined whether RBP-Jk could alter the binding of JIP1 to MLK3 , MKK7 , or JNK1 . Coimmunoprecipitation analysis revealed that RBP-Jk markedly inhibited interaction bet-ween JIP1 , and MLK3 and MKK7 , and did not affect the interaction between JIP1 and JNK1 Figure 6b . We then examined the effect of RBP-Jk on the homo-dimerization of JIP1 in transfected HEK293 cells . Coimmunoprecipitation analysis showed that JIP1 proteins were bound to each other and this interaction was effectively inhibited by RBP-Jk Figure 6c . Earlier the deprivation of glucose and oxygen in hippocam-pal neurons has been shown to induce activation of the JNK pathway and consequent apoptosis dependent on JIP1.22 JNK1 enzyme activity , which was stimulated by glucose deprevation , was promoted through the down-regulation of Notch1 signaling using g-secretase-specific inhibitor DAPT and down-regulation of RBP-Jk expression in JIP1 JIP1 and JIP1 ? ? mouse embryonic fibroblast MEF cells Figure 6d–g . Similarly , ectopic expression of JIP1 in the JIP1 MEF cells supported glucose deprivation-induced JNK1 activation , which was inhibited by ectopic expression of RBP-Jk Figure 6h . RBP-Jk expression also inhibited JNK1 activation in wild-type MEF cells Figure 6i . In contrast , mutant RBP-Jk did not affect the activation of JNK1 induced by JIP1 in the JIP1-introduced JIP1 MEF Figure 6h or the wild-type MEF cells Figure 6i . Furthermore , RBP-Jk , but not mutant RBP-Jk , inhibited glucose deprivation-induced apop-tosis in the JIP1 MEF cells , as shown by 40,6-diamidino-2-phenyl-indole dihydrochloride DAPI staining Figure 6j . Glucose deprivation did not induce apoptosis in the JIP1 MEF cells . Consistent with an earlier report , we found that glucose deprivation-induced cell death was suppressed by Notch1-IC and Notch1-IC-DRAM Figure 6j . Taken together , these results suggest that RBP-Jk inhibits the activation of JNK and apoptosis mediated by JIP1 . Discussion In our earlier report , it was shown that Notch1 negatively regulates the JNK signaling pathway and JNK-dependent cell death through physical binding with JIP1.17 The Notch1-IC-mediated inhibition of JNK signaling seems to require physical interaction , given that Notch1 containing the extracellular cysteine-rich LIN-12 Notch GLP repeats Notch1-LNG , which are not converted to Notch1-IC by g-secretase , did not inhibit JNK activation.17 In contrast , we have now shown that JIP1 can negatively regulate Notch1 signaling by facilitating the accumulation of RBP-Jk in the cytoplasm . 1 292 518 698 fold 80 fold 200 60 150 R.L.U JIP1 ? JBD Furthermore , we found that RBP-Jk inhibited the scaffold activity of JIP1 in the JNK signaling pathway through physical association . These findings give us interesting evidence for negative feedback between Notch1 and JIP1 signaling . Our results showed that Notch1 transcriptional activity was inhibited by JIP1 in intact cells and that the transcriptional activity of endogenous Notch1-IC was higher in JIP1 null cells than in JIP1 wild-type cells , suggesting that JIP1 can regulate Notch1-IC signaling . As the nucleus constitutes the primary site of interaction between Notch1-IC and RBP-Jk , and JIP1 is localized primarily in the cytoplasm , in complexes with components of JNK signaling , it is unlikely that JIP1 directly regulates Notch1-IC transcription activity . In our subsequent experiments , we observed that the subcellular location of RBP-Jk proteins was predominantly in the cytoplasm in the presence of JIP1 , which indicated that JIP1 may regulate the subcellular distribution of RBP-Jk . The subcellular distribution of Notch1-IC was not significantly alerted by JIP1 . Our data imply that JIP1 may suppress Notch1 transcriptional activity through cytoplasmic retention of RBP-Jk Figure 7a . In this study , we observed both in vivo and in vitro binding between RBP-Jk and JIP1 proteins . We also confirmed both in vivo and in vitro binding between Notch1-IC and JIP1 proteins as reported earlier.17 The interaction between JIP1 and either RBP-Jk or Notch1-IC protein was not enhanced by the presence of both proteins together . Furthermore , we also found the formation of the JIP1–Notch1-IC–RBP-Jk trimeric complex in this case . In the trimeric complex , we questioned whether JIP1 could bind RBP-Jk without Notch1-IC , or whether JIP1 could bind Notch1-IC without RBP-Jk . By using Notch1-ICDRAM , which lacks the RBP-Jk-interacting domain , we proved that , while JIP1 can form a trimeric complex with Notch1-IC and RBP-Jk , it binds them at distinct sites despite this trimeric complex formation . Notch1-IC could be localized into the nucleus in the presence of JIP1 , implying that binding between JIP1 and Notch1-IC is not persistently kept . On the basis of these results , we propose that endogenous JIP1 may prevent Notch1 transcriptional activity through the sequester-ing of RBP-Jk , because of the dissociation of Notch1-IC and RBP-Jk . JIP1 contains an N-terminal JBD and C-terminal MLK-and MKK7-binding domain . The C-terminal MLK-and MKK7-binding domain contains a putative PID and an SH3 domains.21,23 JBD binding , in particular , has pivotal functions in binding with JNK . In our earlier reports , we have shown that the JBD domain of JIP1 is the binding site for Notch1-IC.17 Interestingly , our results seem to show that the DJBD domain of JIP1 including SH3 domain is capable of inhibiting Notch1 transcriptional activity through direct binding , whereas the JBD and PID-KE domains alone neither bind to Notch1 , nor inhibit Notch1 transcriptional activity . Accordingly , Notch1-IC and RBP-Jk bind to distinct regions of JIP1 . SH3 domains mediate the assembly of specific protein complexes through binding to proline-rich peptides in their respective binding partners.24 We found that JIP1 did not alter the RBP-Jk PPP AAA mutant and Notch1-IC-mediated transactivation , and subcellular localization of RBP-Jk PPP AAA mutant . Here , we report that maybe the proline-rich region of RBP-Jk is recognized by the SH3 domain of JIP1 . Thus , the SH3 domain is important for the binding of JIP1 to RBP-Jk and the JIP1-induced inhibition of Notch1 signaling . Notch1 has a critical function in the determination of cell fate , and in many cases this is related to the regulation of apoptosis . Interestingly , according to a study by MacKenzie et al.25 , the inhibition of JNK activation and cell death by Notch4 activation in endothelial cells is through RBP-Jk-dependent and -independent pathways , 25 whereas a recent report showed that the activation of RBP-Jk-dependent Notch1 signaling on its own is sufficient to prevent drug-induced JNK activation and cell death.26 Our earlier work shows that Notch1-IC , by binding to JIP1 , interferes with the physical interaction between JIP1 and JNK , thereby antago-nizing the JIP1-mediated activation of JNK signaling.17 Taken together , these earlier reports raise the question of whether RBP-Jk is a critical player in JIP1-mediated activation of JNK signaling and cell death . We observed that RBP-Jk interferes with the physical association of JIP1 with MLK3 and MKK7 , but not with JNK Figure 7b . Given that Notch1-IC and RBP-Jk bind to distinct regions of JIP1 , and that both of the proteins have anti-apoptotic functions , it would be worthwhile to examine the possibility of functional cooperation or compen-sation between Notch1 and RBP-Jk for regulating JIP1-mediated JNK activation and cell death . It would also be of considerable interest to determine whether RBP-Jk , such as Notch1-IC , has a protective function in excitotoxic neuronal injury . The results of this study shed light on a signal cross-talk JIP + + mechanism of RBP-Jk and JIP1 , or they may point to the existence of Notch1-independent cross-talk in the regulation of cell-fate decisions , differentiation , proliferation , and cell death and survival . Materials and Methods Cell culture and transfection . HEK293 cells , NIH3T3 cells , PC12 cells , SH-SY5Y cells , and MEFs from JIP1 ? ? or JIP1 mice were maintained at 371C in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium DMEM supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum and 1 % penicillin streptomycin , in a humidified incubator with an atmosphere containing 5 % CO2 .

Given that Notch1-IC and RBP-Jk bind to distinct regions of JIP1 , and that both of the proteins have anti-apoptotic functions . b At the low level of JIP1 expression , Notch1-IC interacts with RBP-Jk and with coactivator complexes to promote target gene expression . At the high level of JIP1 expression , the RBP-Jk proteins are accumulated in the cytoplasm after it forms a trimeric complex with JIP1 and Notch1 . After binding with JIP1 , however , Notch-IC translocates to the nucleus with unknown mechanism thereby forms a decreased Notch1–RBP-Jk complex by JIP1 in the nucleus 
20523353	S Leverrier1 , GS Salvesen2 and CM Walsh* , 1 On ligation of death receptors DRs , a complex of proteins essential for inducing apoptosis termed as the death-inducing signaling complex DISC is assembled.1 Recruited by association with the death domain-containing adaptor FADD , caspase-8 casp8 is thought to become catalytically active through homodimerization . As an apical caspase , activated casp8 is crucial for most subsequent steps involved in transducing apoptotic signals after DR ligation . Quite unexpectedly , and distinct from the phenotype of mice-bearing mutations in other apoptotic regulatory factors , a deficiency in casp8 terminates embryonic development at roughly 10.5–12 days of gestation.2 Similar embryonic defects have been observed in mice lacking FADD3,4 or the catalytically inactive casp8 homolog c-FLIP , 5 suggesting that DISC constituents serve alternate functions in a variety of cell types . Non-apoptotic functions for casp8 , FADD , and c-FLIP have been observed in proliferating lymphocytes . In mice with a T-cell-specific conditional deletion of casp8 , T-cell clonal expansion is highly defective.6 Similar defects have been observed in mice bearing a transgene encoding a domi-nantly interfering form of FADD , FADDdd , 7–9 or in mice-bearing T-cell-specific conditional deletions of FADD3,10 or c-FLIP.11,12 Furthermore , casp8 is essential for human T-cell function , as individuals bearing a single point mutation that renders casp8 non-functional possess few T cells , and the few remaining T cells are refractory to activation through the T-cell antigen receptor TCR .13 Thus , productive T-cell activation is highly contingent on the function of proteins that are also involved in integrating apoptosis after DR ligation . Earlier studies have shown that incubation of T cells with the broad range caspase inhibitor zVAD-FMK blocks T-cell proliferation.14,15 However , it remains unresolved whether this non-apoptotic function of casp8 requires its catalytic activity . An alternative and plausible scenario is that casp8 may instead serve as a scaffold to orchestrate T-cell signaling . Moreover , if casp8 enzymatic activity is indeed necessary , the mechanistic basis for this non-apoptotic activity in T-cell proliferation and its potential dependency on DR signaling remain elusive . Here , we show using retroviral reconstitution of casp8 T cells that the catalytic activity of this cysteine protease is essential for T-cell clonal expansion in non-apoptotic cells . We further show that this activity does not depend on extrinsic or intrinsic apoptotic-signaling cascades . Finally , we show that pro-casp8 becomes enzymatically active without autoproteolysis and that such autoprocessing is dispensable for efficient T-cell proliferation . Taken together , these findings show that full-length casp8 catalytic activity is both induced by and necessary for the survival of rapidly dividing T cells , suggesting the existence of differential modes of casp8 activation induced by DR ligation versus mitogen stimulation . Results TCR stimulation leads to FADD-dependent induction of IETDase enzymatic activity . To assess caspase catalytic activity in primary T cells , cell lysates obtained after stimu-lation with anti-CD3 plus anti-CD28 were incubated with the fluorogenic probes IETD-7-amino-4-trifluoromethyl coumarin AFC or DEVD-AFC optimally recognized by casp8 and casp3 , respectively . IETDase activity in T lymphocytes isolated from wild-type Wt mice increased over time after stimulation and reached a plateau at roughly 48 h Figure 1a . This is consistent with earlier reports14,15 showing that chemical caspase inhibitors – although now proven to lack selectivity in complex samples16 – block T-cell activation . As a quantitative reference , the IETDase activity observed 36–48 h after TCR stimulation represents roughly two-thirds of the proteolytic induction measured after DR-induced apoptosis Supplementary Figure S2B . On activation , FADDdd-expressing T cells exhibited signi-ficantly reduced IETDase activity . As expected , casp8 T cells possessed greatly diminished IETD-AFC cleavage activity , with the residual activity likely because of other proteases such as casp3 or granzyme B. The decreased activity observed in FADDdd T cells relative to Wt can not be attributed to diminished casp8 expression , as casp8 levels were comparable in both genotypes Figure 1b . Interestingly , although processing of casp8 resulting from cleavage between the large and small subunits of the catalytic domain has been earlier observed in response to DR ligation , immunoblotting analysis revealed that IETDase activity was not accompanied by casp8 processing see below . IETDase activity in mitogen-stimulated Wt T cells was not a result of an increased fraction of cells undergoing apoptosis . Indeed , although slightly induced after TCR stimulation , DEVDase activity – one of the most reliable readouts of apoptotic cells – remained comparable among the three different genotypes Figure 1c . Moreover , the proportion of Annexin-V positive cells remained modestly but consistently higher in FADDdd and casp8 T cells Figure 1d , in accord with earlier studies17,18 showing enhanced death in these mutant T cells . Thus , although IETDase activity was greatly enhanced in mitogenically stimulated Wt T cells , this protease activity , consistent with casp8 activation , did not seem to be linked to apoptotic induction . The enhanced casp8 catalytic activity observed in proliferating T cells was not selectively induced by CD28 co-receptor stimulation , as similar results were observed after activation with anti-CD3 plus hIL2 Supplementary Figure S1A . Taken together , these results suggest that an FADD-dependent casp8 activity is induced in non-apoptotic T cells on TCR stimulation , and occurs in the absence of autoproteolytic processing . As a possible mechanism to eliminate chronically activated lymphocytes , activated T cells induce the expression of death ligands of the TNF family , including FasL , TNF-a , and TRAIL . Accordingly , we tested whether TCR-induced casp8 activity was dependent on extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic-signaling cascades . Inhibition of Fas ligand , TNF-a , or TRAIL using Fas-Fc chimeric protein , antagonistic anti-TNF-a , and anti-TRAIL , respectively , had no impact on IETDase enzymatic AnnV 40 % 20 activity during the course of anti-CD3 CD28 stimulation Supplementary Figure S1B . Thus , the induction of casp8 activity after TCR stimulation was not due to paracrine or autocrine DR stimulation leading to DISC formation.1 The pro-apoptotic protein Bim and the pro-survival factor BclXL , both involved in regulating intrinsic apoptosis , are similarly regulated by TCR ligands . To assess the potential regulation of casp8 activity by intrinsic apoptosis regulators , we evaluated casp8 activity in Bim 19 or BclXL-overexpres-sing20 T cells Supplementary Figure S1C . TCR ligation of T cells from both mutant mouse lines led to an induction of IETDase activity indistinguishable from Wt T cells . The above data suggest that in non-apoptotic T lymphocytes , mitogen-induced casp8 activity is independent of extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic-signaling cascades . Casp8 catalytic activity confers a survival advantage to proliferating T cells . Although casp8 T cells remain sensitive to mitogenic stimulation , they fail to proliferate and survive , 18 suggesting that in this context , casp8 function is to maintain efficient expansion and prevent death . Nevertheless , the importance of casp8 proteolytic activity for T-cell proliferation has not been fully resolved . It is possible that casp8 is essential for T-cell clonal expansion because of a non-enzymatic adaptor function , as casp8 binds to a number of important signaling molecules , including FADD , Rip kinase 1 RIPK1 , and c-FLIP.21 To determine whether casp8 catalytic activity is essential for efficient T-cell proliferation , we reconstituted casp8 catalytic activity in mitogenically activated casp8 T cells . We compared the effect of wild-type casp8 C8-Wt to a catalytically inactive mutant generated by replacing the essential catalytic cysteine with alanine , casp8-CA C8-CA . To overcome the inability to transfect na ? ve ¨ murine T cells , casp8-Wt or C8-CA mutant was subcloned into the MSCV-IRES-Thy1.1 pMit 22 retroviral vector , which in our experi-ence leads to expression at roughly physiological levels in primary T cells see below , a potential concern as overexpression of casp8 can promote apoptosis.23,24 Retro-viral supernatants of comparable titers were used to infect casp8 T cells mitogenically activated for 24 h . The fold change of Thy1.1 expression , a marker of T cells infected with the retrovirus , was compared with the initial measurement at d3 Figure 2a . Thy1.1 expression significantly increased in casp8-Wt-transduced cultures over the 7 days , suggesting that cells reconstituted with Wt catalytically active casp8 possessed a proliferative advantage over control-transduced cells . In contrast , casp8 T cells infected with C8-CA failed to gain a proliferative advantage , supporting the hypothesis that casp8 catalytic activity is crucial for T-cell accumulation after mitogen stimulation . To determine whether this effect was due to an increased cycling rate or to a survival advantage , we analyzed division of Thy1.1 ? cells using CFSE Figure 2b . Casp8 T cells transduced with pMit , casp8-Wt , or C8-CA proceeded through division at roughly equivalent rates , although with very different accumulation profiles , consistent with the notion that casp8 catalytic activity confers a survival advantage . Cells expressing catalytically inactive mutant C8-CA or empty vector initially accumulated , but failed to continue expansion . Strikingly , casp8-Wt-infected cells continued to accumulate over the course of the assay . These findings lead to the interesting conclusion that casp8 catalytic activity does not accelerate cell cycle , but rather maintains the survival of proliferating T cells . a Thy1.1+ 6 4 Change Fold 2 b cells Full-length casp8 is catalytically active in proliferating T cells . Casp8 activation through the DISC has been asso-ciated with concomitant autoproteolysis.23–25 Such proteo-lysis , which occurs between the large and small subunits of the catalytic domain , is not required for generation of catalytic activity , but stabilizes the activated enzyme , at least in vitro.25–27 Although we found casp8 catalytic activity to be essential to the survival of proliferating T cells , we failed to observe any processing of casp8 in TCR-stimulated primary T cells Figure 1b . Moreover , earlier studies14,15 have reported the presence of casp8 proteolytic fragments in activated human T cells , whereas others28 have suggested that full-length casp8 is required after TCR stimulation for optimal T-cell activation . We , therefore , hypothesized that the absence of processing may prevent apoptosis and may indicate a distinct mode of casp8 activation . However , the immunoblotting approach used in Figure 1b may simply have failed to accurately report casp8 processing during T-cell proliferation . Even though caspases have been the focus of intense studies , there are few reliable chemical tools available to study specific activity in vivo.16,29 The widely used probe , bVAD-fmk , not only produces robust labeling of recombinant caspases , and executioner caspases-3 , -6 , and -7 in whole cells , but also yields very high background labeling in vivo 29 and data not shown . We thus used an alternative strategy to specifically determine whether the initiator casp8 may become catalytically active without autoproteolytic processing in primary T lymphocytes . This approach makes use of biotin-EVD-acyloxymethyl ketone bEVD-aomk , a cell-permeant biotinylated activity-based probe that selectively and cova-lently labels active caspases , 30 coupled with two-dimensional gel electrophoretic 2DGE separation to provide a ‘fingerprint’ of enzymatically active caspase isoforms present in viable cells before lysis . Purified T cells were mitogenically stimu-lated for 36 h , and during the final hour of culture , bEVD-aomk was added , followed by lysis . As a control for casp8 activation by DR ligation , parallel cultures activated for 24 h were incubated with anti-Fas for an additional 6 h before bEVD-aomk labeling and cell lysis . When tested for in vivo labeling by bEVD-aomk , full-length endogenous pro-casp8 was found to be linked to the biotinylated substrate in mitogenically activated primary Wt T cells , as detected by Avidin Biotin-HRP probing of 2DGE blots Figure 3a , but not in Wt T cells treated with anti-Fas Figure 3b . As a control , naive and activated casp8 T cells were also submitted to an in vivo labeling by bEVD-aomk , and as expected , neither inactive casp8 nor active casp8 could be detected Supplementary Figure S2 . To analyze the effect of bEVD irreversible binding to casp8 on the protein’s pI , we have labeled recombinant pre-activated human casp8 mutant form lacking the 2 DED domains , DDED-casp8 with bEVD , or with its vehicle DMSO as a control Supplementary Figure S3 . After separation on a 2DGE , both labeled and unlabeled DDED-casp8 lead to several spots between 6.4 and 6.9 , but only the protein incubated with the biotinylated substrate shows an additional spot , suggesting that bEVD binding on casp8 induces a pI shift toward the acidic pole . This shift can be correlated with the appearance of the two active forms No. 3 and No. 4 in the mitogenically activated sample , suggesting that these two ‘more acidic’ forms are the result of bEVD binding . As full-length casp8 is not active in anti-Fas-treated cells , only the unlabeled forms No. 1 and No. 2 are present . These data also suggest that when mitogenically activated T cells are treated with anti-Fas , the pool of catalytically activated full-length casp8 becomes fully processed , most probably by casp6 and or casp3 , providing an amplification loop . This may explain why proliferating T cells are much more susceptible to DR-mediated apoptosis . Moreover , in these DR-stimulated cells , the overall amount of full-length casp8 was lower than in activated cells , a likely result of casp8 proteolysis . Even though casp8 cleaved products were not detected after 6 h of anti-Fas treatment – compared with 2 h post-induction in which p30 and p18 were revealed by casp8 mAb Supplementary Figure S4 – we chose this ‘relatively late’ time point of 6 h to analyze caspase in vivo activities , as primary naive T cells require a preliminary TCR-mediated activation before being sensitive to anti-Fas , and our objective was to clearly distinguish mitogenically stimulated T cells from apoptotic cells . Despite modest DEVDase activity in proliferating T cells , casp3 in vivo labeling revealed a series of active forms , corresponding to the p19 and p17 fragments.25 It is unlikely that non-specific bEVD-aomk labeling occurred during the lysis procedure , as it was performed under highly denaturing conditions . However , this concern may be significant for IETDase and DEVDase activity assays involving post-lysis incubation with AFC-labeled substrates . A comparison of these experimental procedures revealed further casp3 , but not casp8 , processing during post-lysis incubation Supple-mentary Figure S5A and B . Nevertheless , DEVDase activity remained significantly lower in the non-apoptotic versus anti-Fas-treated sample Supplementary Figure S5C . As an additional control , naive Wt T cells have also been incubated with bEVD-aomk , which failed to reveal active casp8 or casp3 Supplementary Figure S6 . Overall , these results show that full-length endogenous pro-casp8 attains catalytic activity on mitogenic stimulation , but not after DR ligation in T lymphocytes . Proteolytic processing is not required for casp8 activation in non-apoptotic T cells . Given the apparent absence of casp8 processing after its catalytic activation in response to mitogenic stimulation of T cells , we then sought to determine whether blockade of casp8 processing impacts T-cell proliferation . In vitro studies26 have shown that a non-cleavable mutant of casp8 can dimerize , albeit to a lesser extent than the Wt , and that such dimers retain normal enzymatic activity.27 Moreover , a recent study by Wallach and coworkers31 has revealed that in T cells expressing a non-cleavable form of casp8 , responsiveness to TCR stimulation is not compromised , whereas DR-induced apop - tosis is impacted . To explore this further , we used the aforementioned approach to reconstitute casp8 T cells with a mutant form of the initial self-processing site of casp8 that occurs to separate the two subunits of the catalytic domain C8-D387A . Activated casp8 T cells were trans-duced with retroviruses carrying empty vector pMit , the D387A processing mutant or casp8-Wt , and we measured the fold change of Thy1.1 ? retrovirally infected cells . We determined that the non-cleavable casp8-D387A mutant confers a similar survival advantage as casp8-Wt when introduced into casp8 T cells Figure 4a . Transgene-enforced casp8 expression in casp8 T cells was found to be comparable with that of endogenous casp8 in Wt T cells Figure 4b . We also observed that the recovery of cycling cells was similar in casp8-Wt and casp8-D387A-expressing cells , and significantly greater than that found for pMit-transduced cells Figure 4c . On TCR stimulation , casp8 T cells reconstituted with either of the above casp8 constructs or with the empty vector exhibited an equivalent level of basal apoptosis , as assessed by the fold change in Annexin-V positive cells Figure 4d . However , after a 6 h incubation with anti-Fas , Annexin-V staining was significantly higher in casp8-Wt-expressing T cells when compared with pMit - , C8-CA - , or casp8-D387A-transduced cells data not shown . Overall , these results show that casp8 cleavage is dispensable for rescuing the proliferative defect of casp8 T cells , and suggest that catalytically active full-length casp8 promotes T-cell survival without eliciting an immediate apoptotic response . Further , although casp8 catalytic activity is critical for T-cell survival during proliferation and for DR-induced apoptosis , casp8 processing is only required for the latter . Differential induction of casp8 enzymatic activity in CD8 versus CD4T cell subsets . Casp8 T cells are defective in mitogen-induced proliferation relative to Wt T cells , and this defect is particularly acute in CD8 ? T lymphocytes , 18 a result similarly observed in FADDdd-expressing T cells.22 As casp8 catalytic activity promotes survival during T-cell proliferation through a pathway dependent on FADD , we analyzed casp8 activity in both CD4 ? and CD8 ? sub-populations using magnetic sorting of Wt and FADDdd splenocytes Figure 5a . After culture with anti-CD3 plus anti-CD28 , a substantial level of IETDase proteolytic activity was present in CD8 ? cells , with only very modest induction of enzymatic activity in CD4 ? cells . As with unfractionated T cells , a diminished level of IETDase activity was observed in CD8 ? FADDdd cells , reinforcing the link between FADD-dependent casp8 induction and T-cell proliferation . To determine whether casp8 catalytic activity in CD8 ? T cells was accompanied by efficient proliferation , we reconstituted casp8 catalytic activity in mitogenically activated casp8 T cells – as in Figure 2a – and compared the effect of C8-Wt in both CD8 ? and CD4 ? subsets Figure 5b . Thy1.1 expression significantly increased in casp8-Wt CD8 ? -transduced cultures over the 7 days , whereas the proliferative advantage gained by casp8 CD4 ? T cells infected with casp8-Wt was significantly lower , showing that casp8 catalytic activity is required to a greater extent in proliferating CD8 ? versus CD4 ? T-cell subsets . Thy1.1+ 6 C8-CAC8-D387A pMitpMitC8-Wt Such results may trivially be a consequence of differential induction of casp8 expression in CD8 ? versus CD4 ? T cells . However , levels of pro-casp8 were very similar in both T-cell subsets and in both genotypes , showing that a rise in casp8 expression level is not sufficient to induce its activity , supporting the notion that other regulatory mechanism s are involved Figure 5c . Likewise , differential expression of c-FLIP might account for these findings . Although enhanced by TCR stimulation , c-FLIP expression was similar in CD4 ? versus CD8 ? T-cell subsets – with only a slight increase in naive Wt CD4 ? cells – discounting the possibility that differential expression of this casp8 regulatory factor accounts for differences in casp8 enzymatic activity between the two subsets . Although c-FLIP is required for T-cell proli-feration , 11,12 changes in its expression in proliferating lymphocytes do not seem sufficient to promote casp8 activity induced by mitogens . Although caspases are clearly critical mediators in the route to apoptosis , studies from many groups have highlighted a large number of additional cellular functions these cysteine pro-teases control.32 One of these alternative functions is to a 3000 CD4+ Activity 1500 IETDase Thy1.1+ 6 ? actin cFLIP ? actin promote the clonal expansion and survival of mitogenically stimulated lymphocytes.21 Here , we have found that non-apoptotic casp8 catalytic activity is induced in cycling CD8 ? T cells . We have further showed that mitogen-dependent casp8 activation is distinct from that induced by DR ligation , with only the latter involving proteolysis in the linker separating the two subunits of the catalytic domain , generally considered to be a result of autoprocessing . However , both processes leading to casp8 activation depend on the activity of FADD . Finally , we have found that C8-Wt and a cleavage-resistant mutant , but not a catalytically inactive mutant form , were capable of rescuing the defective survival of mitogenically stimulated casp8 T cells . These results show that the enzymatic function , but not processing of casp8 , is crucial for T lymphocyte clonal expansion . This work raises several important questions . First , how might casp8 be activated in proliferating lymphocytes inde-pendent of DR signaling ? A recent report31 has shown that T-cell activation is not affected in mice bearing a mutation in the casp8 processing site . Our findings extend that notion by showing that casp8 acquires enzymatic activity in a DR-independent manner without inter-subunit proteolysis , and that this activity maintains T-cell survival and efficient clonal expansion . These findings imply distinct cellular contexts in which casp8 enzymatic activity is facilitated , possibly involving the formation of an analog of the DR-induced DISC . We have recently discovered that casp8 and FADD associate with RIPK1 and the autophagosome-associated proteins Atg5 , Atg12 , and Atg16L , 33 suggesting that casp8 is recruited to pre-autophagosomal structures , possibly leading to the induction of its enzymatic activity . FADDdd and casp8 T-cells display hyperautophagic morphologies after mitogenic stimulation , and interference with autophagic-signaling rescues these proliferative defects . We have further observed that casp8 activity is dependent on Vps34 , an important regulator of pre-autosomal structure development , as its blockade with 3-methyladenine diminished non-apoptotic IETDase induction in cycling Wt T cells . Treatment with the RIPK1-specific inhibitor Necrostatin-134 also completely restored the defective proliferation of casp8 T cells , and reduced IETDase activity , suggesting that RIPK1 signaling may be the target of casp8 activity in proliferating T cells . Finally , silencing of RIPK1 in casp8 T cells similarly rescued their proliferation.35 Overall , these findings support the concept that during T-cell clonal expansion , casp8 activity is regulated within a DISC-like complex in a DR-independent manner , in which it modulates autophagic signaling . Differ-ential complex assembly may thus explain the distinct modes through which casp8 activity is achieved DR-induced casp8 activation is accompanied by autoproteolytic cleavage , likely occurring within the DISC , whereas mitogen-induced casp8 activation fails to induce self-processing . This may also explain the selective necessity for FADD and casp8 activity in mitogen-and Ag-stimulated CD8 ? T cells22,33 in which the high rate of cell division observed in these cells may place very stringent energetic demands that necessitate autophagic signaling . However , in this sense , an alternative explanation is simply that CD8 ? T cells generate distinct signaling cascades that depend on FADD and casp8 . The means by which active casp8 is restrained from inducing caspase-dependent apoptosis in proliferating lymphocytes also remains an important question , a paradox originally considered within the framework of the initial discovery of non-apoptotic caspase activity in T cells.21 One explanation is that the context of casp8 activation itself is important . Our findings indicate that self-processing is differentially involved in these seemingly opposing casp8 functions it is needed for the induction of DR-dependent cell death , but not for triggering T-cell proliferation . The mono-meric form of casp8 is activated by dimerization25,27,36 and not by proteolysis , and the essential biochemical difference between single chain casp8 and processed two chain casp8 seems simply to be a matter of stability of the active dimer . How does this difference play into the distinct biological functions of the protease ? Perhaps the higher stability of the cleaved dimer results in a more sustained proteolytic signal . Alternatively , the absence of casp8 proteolysis may limit the potential of this activated protease to interact with down-stream targets that would promote apoptosis . Such restriction may conversely enhance substrate selectivity against non-apoptotic targets , such as RIPK1 , the kinase domain of which potentiates both autophagic and necroptotic signaling.37,38 It is still not clear whether proteolysis in the linker segment correlates with proteolytic removal of the casp8 pro-domain , which contains receptor interacting DEDs . Thus , activated full-length casp8 may also remain associated through its pro-domain to its binding partners and this would entail sequestration of the protease within a restricted subcellular compartment , such as pre-autophagosomal structures . Con-finement of enzymatically active casp8 at such structures would prevent free diffusion through the cytosol , potentially limiting its interactions with apoptosis promoting substrates such as casp3 and Bid . This may explain observations described here and elsewhere15 of limited casp3 activity in proliferating T cells as compared with that of apoptotic cells . In addition , other anti-apoptotic proteins may also prevent the elaboration of an apoptotic response in proliferating T cells until such a response is required to maintain lymphoid homeostasis . Consistent with this , an XIAP deficiency in human T cells leads to apoptotic hypersensitivity in response to both CD95-crosslinking as well as mitogenic stimulation.39 Although many important questions remain unanswered , including the identity of activated full-length casp8 interaction partners , substrates , and inhibitors , the study here highlights a vital mechanism for the regulation of casp8 catalytic activity in proliferating versus apoptotic T lymphocytes .

20539307	Y-T Wu1 , H-L Tan1 , Q Huang1 , X-J Sun2 , X Zhu2 and H-M Shen* , 1,3 On the basis of the morphological and biochemical features , programmed cell death PCD can be classified into three categories apoptosis , autophagic cell death , and necrosis.1 The autophagic cell death has been described as a non-apoptotic cell death that is caused by excessive induction of autophagy2,3 On the other hand , there are several types of programmed necrosis described in the literature , including necrosis induced by ATP depletion , 4 and necroptosis initiated by engagement of death receptors with their corresponding ligands , such as tumor necrosis factor-a TNFa .5 TNFa is a pleiotropic proinflammatory cytokine that is capable of triggering multiple signaling pathways to regulate various physiological and pathological cellular processes . One important biological function of TNFa is to induce apoptosis by the extrinsic pathway.6 On the other hand , TNFa has also been demonstrated to trigger programmed necrosis , or necroptosis , in a number of cell types.7–10 The execution of necroptosis requires the kinase activity of receptor-interacting protein 1 RIP1 and can be blocked by the RIP1 kinase inhibitor , necrostatin-1.9–11 At present , how RIP1 controls necroptosis is largely unknown . One possibility is that RIP1 may promote intracellular ROS production and c-Jun N-terminal kinase JNK activation by the activation of Nox1 NADPH oxidase.12 Recently , RIP3 has been identified as another crucial factor in TNFa-induced necrotic cell death by interacting with RIP1.8,13,14 In TNFa-mediated necroptosis , there is one intriguing observation blockage of caspase cascade by either chemical inhibitors or overexpression of a viral caspase inhibitor CrmA greatly promotes the cell death.15,16 The exact mechanisms underlying such a sensitization effect are not known . As caspase 8 has been shown to cleave RIP1 in TNFa signaling , 17 one possibility is that suppression of the caspase cascade would enhance the RIP1 protein stability and then promote RIP1-mediated necroptosis . Among many types of caspase inhibitors , zVAD-fmk zVAD is probably the most commonly used pan-caspase inhibitor . Interestingly , although zVAD has been demon-strated to be of low cytotoxicity to most of cell lines in vitro , 18 it can induce robust necrotic cell death in certain cell lines , particularly in L929 cells.19,20 Such necrosis was originally recognized as an autophagic cell death evidenced by a massive accumulation of the autophagic markers in the dying cells.19 However , our earlier works have provided compelling evidence that zVAD-induced cell death in L929 cells is not autophagy-dependent instead , autophagy has a protective function for cell survival.20,21 Therefore , the pro-death mechanism in zVAD-mediated necroptosis remains to be examined . In this study , we demonstrate that autocrine production of TNFa is required for zVAD-induced necrotic cell death in L929 cells . Furthermore , zVAD-mediated autocrine production of TNFa is achieved by the activation of the protein kinase C PKC –mitogen-activated protein kinases MAPKs –activat-ing protein-1 AP-1 signaling pathway . Data from this study thus provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying zVAD-induced necroptosis , an important form of PCD with increasing understanding of its biological signi-ficance in health and diseases . Results zVAD-fmk and BocD-fmk , but not QVD-oph , induce necrosis in L929 cells . zVAD-fmk zVAD is a well-established general caspase inhibitor to block apoptosis . Intriguingly , zVAD is also capable of efficiently inducing necrotic cell death in a selected group of cell types , particularly in L929 cells.19,20 In this study , we first asked whether other caspase inhibitors possess the similar activity as zVAD for induction of necrosis . As shown in Figure 1a , among the caspase inhibitors tested , only zVAD-fmk and BocD-fmk were able to induce evident cell death in L929 cells . Interestingly , QVD-oph , another pan-caspase inhibitor that has been reported to be more efficient and of broader-spectrum than zVAD-fmk and BocD-fmk for caspase inhibition , 22 was unable to induce cell death Figure 1a . The effectiveness of all these caspase inhibitors was confir-med by their inhibitory effects on TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand TRAIL -induced cleavage of caspase 8 , caspase 3 , and poly ADP-ribose polymerase-1 PARP-1 in L929 cells Figure 1b . Among the caspase inhibitors tested above , the fmk group has been demonstrated to be much more cytotoxic than oph.18 We thus tested whether it is the fmk group that confers zVAD-fmk and BocD-fmk the killing ability . First , we found that neither zFA-fmk a non-caspase inhibitor carrying fmk group alone nor zFA-fmk plus QVD-oph induces cell death data not shown . Next , the two caspase 8 inhibitors with different tags , IETD-fmk and IETD-oph , were found to induce marginal necrosis in L929 cells Figure 1a . Moreover , at the same concentration , IETD-oph was slightly more toxic than IETD-fmk Figure 1a . These results therefore negate the possibility that it is the fmk group leading to the cell death . In an earlier report , the killing ability of zVAD was attributed to its caspase 8 inhibition effect.19 In this study , we further examined this by overexpression of CrmA , a viral protein known to specifically inhibit caspase 8.23 As shown in Figure 1c , overexpression of CrmA indicated by co-trans-fected GFP fluorescence in L929 cells led to no cell death , whereas CrmA greatly enhanced cell death in the cells treated with exogenous TNFa , being consistent with earlier observations.16 Furthermore , knockdown of caspase 8 or fas-associated death domain FADD did not kill L929 cells Supplementary Figure S1b , while effectively suppressed TRAIL-induced caspase 3 and PARP-1 cleavage , and apoptosis Supplementary Figure S1a , S1b . Taken together , all these findings clearly suggest that inhibition of caspase 8 alone is not sufficient for zVAD to induce cell death in L929 cells . zVAD-induced necrotic cell death requires de novo protein synthesis . To further understand the mechanisms underlying zVAD-induced cell death , we then tested whether de novo gene transcription and protein synthesis are required for such cell death . As shown in Figure 1d , actino-mycin D ActD or cycloheximide CHX offered perfect protection against zVAD-induced cell death . In contrast , ActD or CHX markedly enhanced TNFa-induced cell death in L929 cells data not shown , indicating that their protective effect is specific to zVAD-induced cell death . These results thus suggest that zVAD-induced necrotic cell death requires de novo gene transcription and protein synthesis . Another interesting and accidental finding is that the volume of cell culture medium affects zVAD-induced cell death . As shown in Figure 1e , when L929 cells were cultured in different volume of medium containing the same final concentration of zVAD 10 mM , the cell death was found to be mitigated by increasing medium volume . In contrast , alterations of medium volume did not affect cell death induced by exogenously administered TNFa Figure 1e . It is thus possible that some newly synthesized proteins are secreted into the medium to trigger the cell death signaling pathway . zVAD-induced cell death is RIP1-and RIP3-dependent . It has been well-established that RIP1 has a critical function in TNFa-induced necroptosis and that necrostatin-1 , a specific RIP1 kinase inhibitor , can suppress necroptosis.24 In this study , necrostatin-1 was found to be effective in suppressing cell death induced by zVAD , similar to that induced by TNFa , but not in MNNG-induced necrosis which has been reported to be mediated by PARP-1 overactivation data not shown . On the other hand , RIP3 has recently been identified as a key modulator in TNFa-induced necrop-tosis.8,13,14 In this study , we also tested whether RIP3 is involved in zVAD-fmk-induced cell death . As shown in Supplementary Figure S2 , knockdown of RIP3 signi-ficantly reduced cell death induced by zVAD or TNFa , while displayed no effect on TRAIL-induced apoptosis . It is thus believed that zVAD-induced cell death is similar to TNFa-induced necroptosis involving both RIP1 and RIP3 . zVAD promotes autocrine production of TNFa . L929 cells are well known to produce a variety of cytokines , including TNFa.25 Moreover , autocrine production of TNFa has been recently recognized as a critical signal for the induction of apoptosis in response to Smac-mimetics or IAP antago-nists.26–28 In this study , we hypothesized that autocrine production of TNFa is involved in zVAD-induced necrotic cell death . A very low basal level of TNFa around 3 pg ml was detected in the medium Figure 2a , while the TNFa level was markedly increased upon zVAD treatment for 8 h Figure 2b . The drop of TNFa concentration at 24 h-time point was probably due to cell death as shown earlier . Meanwhile , pretreatment with CHX totally abrogated the autocrine production of TNFa Figure 2b . Next , we checked TNFa mRNA level using RT-PCR . As shown in Figure 2c , there zVAD-fmk BocD-fmk DMSO was a higher level of TNFa mRNA in zVAD-treated cells than that in control cells . More importantly , both zVAD-fmk and BocD-fmk , but not QVD-oph , enhanced the transcription of TNFa Figure 2c and accordingly , autocrine production QVD-oph IETD-fmk IETD-oph DEVD-cho TRAIL medium of TNFa in the medium Figure 2d . Such findings are also consistent with the pattern of cell death induced by these caspase inhibitors as shown in Figure 1a . Blockage of TNFa signaling suppresses zVAD-induced necroptosis . To test whether zVAD-induced autocrine production of TNFa , as shown above , is required for cell death , we first intercepted the TNFa signaling by blocking TNFa receptor 1 TNFR1 using a TNFR1 blocking antibody . It is to be noted that this antibody dose-dependently suppressed zVAD-induced cell death Supplementary Figure S3a . As expected , this antibody also prevented exogenous TNFa-induced cell death , without showing any protection against TRAIL-induced apoptosis in L929 cells Supplementary Figure S3a . Moreover , a TNFa-neutralizing antibody that specifically neutralizes the TNFa ligand in Cell 20 % Viable 40 % 40 Viable culture medium also ablated zVAD-induced cell death dose-dependently Supplementary Figure S3b . In an attempt to seek further supporting evidence , we next used XENP1595 , a DN-TNF protein against soluble TNFa as reported previously.29 As shown in Supplementary Figure S3c , XENP1595 offered perfect protection against cell death induced by zVAD and exogenous TNFa . Collec-tively , these data clearly demonstrate that zVAD-induced necrotic cell death in L929 cells is necroptosis that depends on autocrine production of TNFa . Remarkably , such findings are consistent with a recent report in which autocrine production of TNFa was identified , through a genome-wide RNAi library screening , to be required for zVAD-induced cell death in L929 cells.30 Nuclear factor-kB NF-kB pathway is not involved in zVAD-induced autocrine production of TNFa , but has a protective AP-1 activitation is required for zVAD-induced autocrine production of TNFa and cell death . In addition to NF-kB , another important transcription factor , AP-1 , has been implicated in TNFa transcription.32 We thus attempted to elucidate the possible role of AP-1 in zVAD-mediated autocrine production of TNFa and subsequent necroptosis . As c-Jun is one of the essential components of AP-1 , we TNF 1 20 function during zVAD-induced necroptosis . It is known that both canonical and non-canonical NF-kB pathways are implicated in autocrine production of TNFa in cancer cells.26,28 In this study , we investigated whether NF-kB pathway is involved in zVAD-induced autocrine production of TNFa . We first silenced I-kB kinase IKKb and IKKa , the two key upstream kinases of NF-kB . The IKKb and IKKa knockdown efficiency was shown in Figure 3a . Disruption of the canonical NF-kB pathway by targeting IKKb markedly sensitized L929 cells to zVAD-induced cell death , whereas silencing the non-canonical pathway by targeting IKKa did not significantly affect cell death Figure 3b . We next disrupted the canonical and non-canonical NF-kB pathways by directly silencing their key components , RelA and RelB , respectively . The knock-down efficiency is shown in Figure 3c . Knockdown of RelA also greatly sensitized L929 cells to necroptosis induced by zVAD Figure 3d , being consistent to the data from knock-down of IKKb Figure 3b . Finally , we found that knockdown of RelA or RelB failed to block the autocrine production of TNFa Figure 3e . It is thus believed that neither the canonical nor the non-canonical NF-kB pathway contributes to zVAD-induced TNFa transcription , and the canonical NF-kB path-way acts as a prosurvival mechanism to ablate zVAD-induced cell death . ? 5 0 DMSO zVAD QVD BocD first examined the effects of c-Jun knockdown on AP-1 activity , TNFa transcription , and cell death . The knockdown efficiency is shown in Figure 4a . Silencing of c-Jun signi-ficantly ablated AP-1 luciferase activity in the cells treated with zVAD Figure 4b and reduced TNFa mRNA trans-cription Figure 4c . As expected , knockdown of c-Jun dramatically suppressed zVAD-induced cell death in L929 cells Figure 4d . Therefore , this set of data strongly implies that AP-1 is responsible for zVAD-stimulated TNFa transcription . zVAD-induced AP-1 activation is mediated by JNK and ERK . Next , we sought to explore the upstream signaling pathways mediating zVAD-induced AP-1 activation , by focusing on mitogen-activated protein kinases MAPKs . First , zVAD treatment was found to activate c-Jun Figure 5a . Second , zVAD was able to enhance the phos-phorylation of JNK and extracellular signal-regulated kinase ERK , the two important MAPKs upstream of AP-1 Figure 5a . As TNFa is also known as a activator of MAPKs and c-Jun 33 it is thus possible that the activation of JNK , ERK , and c-Jun is triggered by autocrine production of TNFa , but not by zVAD per se . To exclude this possibility , we treated the cells with TNFa-neutralizing antibody to block the secreted TNFa function and found that zVAD was still capable of activating JNK , ERK , and c-Jun Figure 5b , suggesting that zVAD-activated MAPKs is independent of autocrine production of TNFa . To further test whether JNK and ERK are the upstream molecules mediating AP-1 activation upon zVAD treatment , we next used two chemical inhibitors , SP600125 SP and PD98059 PD , to inhibit JNK and ERK activation , respectively . As shown in Figure 5c , these two inhibitors almost completely abrogated zVAD-induced phosphorylation of JNK and ERK , as well as that of c-Jun . As a result , they blocked zVAD-induced AP-1 activa-tion as determined by the AP-1 luciferase assay Figure 5d . As expected , these inhibitors dramatically suppressed the autocrine production of TNFa Figure 5e and eventually offered perfect protection against zVAD-induced necroptosis in L929 cells Figure 5f . Therefore , data from this part of the study clearly demonstrate that the MAPKs-mediated AP-1 activation is required for zVAD-induced autocrine production of TNFa and subsequent necroptosis . 20 PKC has a critical function in zVAD-mediated MAPKs-AP1 activation , autocrine production of TNFa , and cell death . After establishing the role of MAPKs JNK and ERK in zVAD-induced TNFa transcription , here we sought to find the upstream mechanism mediating zVAD-induced MAPKs activation . It has been well established that PKC is one of the important signals upstream of MAPKs.34 Therefore , we examined whether zVAD is able to activate MAPKs by PKC . First , zVAD was found to evidently activate PKC , similar to the effect of 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate TPA , as determined by phosphorylation of the total PKC substrate Figure 6a . A PKC inhibitor PKCi , bisindolylmaleimide I was able to completely inhibit both reactions . Importantly , TPA enhanced , whereas PKCi effectively suppressed , zVAD-induced phosphorylation of JNK , ERK , and c-Jun Figure 6b , suggesting that PKC acts upstream of JNK and ERK , leading to AP-1 activation . Consistently , TPA was found to promote TNFa transcription and secretion Figure 6c and d . Moreover , TPA further enhanced , whereas PKCi almost completely blocked , zVAD-induced TNFa autocrine production Figure 6c and d . As expected , TPA markedly increased , whereas PKCi perfectly protected against , zVAD-induced cell death . Interestingly , TPA and PKCi modulated exogenously administered TNFa-induced necroptosis in an opposite pattern to their effects on zVAD-induced necroptosis Figure 6e . These results suggest that activation of PKC can enhance zVAD-induced necroptosis by promoting autocrine production of TNFa , without affecting the downstream TNFa signaling pathways . To further understand the involvement of PKC in zVAD-induced necroptosis as demonstrated above , we compared the effects of different pan-caspase inhibitors on PKC activation . As anticipated , zVAD-fmk and BocD-fmk , but not QVD-oph , were capable of activating PKC , as well as JNK , ERK , and c-Jun Figure 7a . This result prompted us to test whether activation of PKC would affect the effect of QVD-oph on L929 cells . Interestingly , TPA indeed effectively turned QVD-oph into a cell killer Figure 7b , while it has no effect on DEVD-cho caspase 3 inhibitor Figure 7b , indicating that inhibition of certain caspases by QVD-oph , but not by DEVD-cho , is critical for such cell death . Similarly , TPA was also effective for induction of necroptosis in cells with knockdown of caspase 8 Figure 7c , whereas knockdown of caspase 8 per se is not cytotoxic Supplementary Figure S1 . Such observations thus suggest that both autocrine produc-tion of TNFa and inhibition of the caspase cascade are required for necroptosis induced by zVAD-fmk and BocD-fmk . Discussion In recent years , necrotic cell death has been increasingly appreciated as an important form of PCD . In contrast to apoptosis , the molecular mechanisms underlying necrosis is much less understood . Necrosis usually occurs in cells when the apoptosis machinery is suppressed or absent . zVAD-induced necrotic cell death is among several necrosis models established so far . In this study , we identified autocrine production of TNFa as the missing pro-death signal in zVAD-induced necrotic cell death or necroptosis . Such results are indeed consistent with a recent report in which TNFR1 and autocrine production of TNFa were found to be crucial for zVAD-induced necrosis in L929 cells.30 It is known that endogenously produced TNFa can be secreted into the extracellular environments or exists as a membrane-bound form , both of which are able to trigger downstream signaling , leading to cell death.35 It is to be noted that our data suggest activity siRNA Scramble luciferase c-Jun fold 1 c-Jun siRNA 120 100 % 80 cells 60 Viable 40 20 0 that zVAD-fmk-induced necroptosis in L929 cells is predomi-nantly executed by the secreted soluble TNFa , on the basis of the following observations i the TNFa-neutralizing antibody , which can only neutralize the soluble TNFa in medium , attenuated zVAD-fmk-induced cell death Supplementary Figure S3b and ii blocking the soluble TNFa by the DN-TNF protein offered perfect protection against zVAD-fmk-induced cell death Supplementary Figure S3c . The major aim of this study is to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying zVAD-induced autocrine production of TNFa . It is known that the TNFa promoter region contains both NF-kB and AP-1 responsive elements.36 In cancer cells treated with the IAP antagonists , autocrine TNFa is produced by both the canonical and non-canonical NF-kB path-ways.26,28 In this study , we show that zVAD mainly uses the AP-1 pathway , but not the NF-kB pathway , to promote TNFa transcription Figures 3 and 4 . It is to be noted that such a notion is also supported by the finding in which , by using genome-wide RNAi library screening , Jun , but not NF-kB components , was identified as one of the critical functions involved in zVAD-induced necrosis.30 Moreover , we demon-strate that zVAD-induced AP-1 activation in L929 cells is mediated by the activation of MAPKs including JNK and ERK Figure 5 . These data are indeed consistent with recent luciferase fold reports that TNFa expression was regulated by JNK32 or ERK.37 Therefore , it appears that the transcriptional machi-nery for TNFa expression is cell type and stimulus specific . One important finding in this study is that PKC acts upstream of MAPKs to promote autocrine production of TNFa in response to zVAD . The PKC family is an important group of proteins with diverse functions in many cellular processes such as cell proliferation , differentiation , and cell death.38 Among the three pan-caspase inhibitors tested in this study zVAD-fmk , BocD-fmk , and QVD-oph , their effects on PKC activation , autocrine production of TNFa , and induction of cell death are highly correlated Figures 1a , 2c , d , and 7a . Moreover , when combining with caspase inhibition , the typical PKC activator , TPA , was found to induce necroptosis in L929 cells Figure 7b and c . Among the three groups of PKC , TPA is able to activate both the conventional a , b , and g and novel d , e , y , and Z isoforms of PKC.39 Therefore , future work should include the identification of the exact isoforms of PKC involved in zVAD-induced autocrine production of TNFa and cell death . Another important and intriguing question would be how zVAD activates PKC . It appears that the activation of PKC is not related to caspase inhibition as QVD-oph fails to activate PKC . On the other hand , zVAD-fmk and BocD-fmk have been reported to possess nonspecific inhibitory effect toward other proteases such as cathepsins , while QVD-oph does not.22 It is thus possible that PKC activation might be due to the off-target effect of zVAD-fmk and BocD-fmk . Although zVAD has been shown in this study to promote TNFa transcription and production , the autocrine level is still very low around 10pg ml Figure 2b . Exogenous TNFa of such a concentration was found not cytotoxic data not shown . Remarkably , when combining with zVAD , exogenous TNFa could induce necroptosis in L929 cells with a much faster kinetics and at a much lower concentration data not shown . Therefore , it is believed that zVAD performs a dual function to induce necroptosis in L929 cells i to promote autocrine production of TNFa , and ii to sensitize L929 cells to TNFa-induced necroptosis , most probably by suppression of the caspase cascade . At present , there is some evidence linking caspase suppression with promotion of necroptosis , on the basis of an earlier report that RIP1 , the key kinase in TNFa-mediated necroptosis , is cleaved by caspase 8.17 This notion is also supported and strengthened by the following observations from this study i although TPA alone and QVD-oph alone were not cytotoxic , combined treatment of TPA and QVD-oph was able to kill the cells efficiently Figure 7b and ii TPA alone was capable of inducing necroptosis when caspase 8 is silenced Figure 7c . Thus far , the detailed mechanism under-lying this sensitization effect requires further investigations . Targeting caspase has been developed as a therapeutic approach to inhibit pathological apoptosis in vivo . However , the success of antiapoptotic therapies has been limited in mammalian cells and one possible reason is that the cells may undergo necrosis in the absence of apoptotic pathway.5,15 Such a hypothesis is underscored by two very recent studies the programmed necrosis in vivo was shown to implicate in the defense against vaccinia virus infection , 13 and cerulein-induced acute pancreatitis is resulted from massive necrosis in vivo.8 Interestingly , in both models , the necrosis was triggered by endogenous TNFa . As a potent pan-caspase inhibitor , zVAD has been applied to various animal models to suppress the apoptotic responses . Recently , zVAD was reported to improve the therapeutic outcomes of radiation on tumor xenograft.40 It remains to be further determined whether the observed therapeutic effect of zVAD in vivo is due to caspase inhibition and suppression of apoptosis or due to promotion of autocrine production of TNFa and induction of necroptosis . Taken together , data from this study suggest that a group of caspase inhibitors represented by zVAD are capable of inducing programmed necrosis or necroptosis by the following two orchestrated pathways i promotion of autocrine produc-tion of TNFa by PKC–MAPKs–AP-1 signaling pathway , and ii inhibition of the caspase cascade , as illustrated in Figure 7d . It is of interest to further examine whether zVAD zVAD TPA PKCi 120 DMSO PKCi TPA Viable 40 0 or other caspase inhibitors possess similar effects on other cell types , especially in human cancer cells .

20616807	YJ Kang1,3,4 , M-K Lu1,2,3 and K-L Guan* , 1 www.nature.com cdd Tuberous sclerosis complex TSC is an autosomal dominant disease characterized by the growth of benign tumors in multiple vital organs such as brain , which results in severe neurological disorders.1 Mutations in either TSC1 or TSC2 lead to constitutive activation of mTORC1 the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 and downstream signaling cascades , resulting in the development of TSC . The TSC1 and TSC2 proteins interact with each other to form a physical and functional complex that regulates cell growth by inhibiting the Ras homolog enriched in brain Rheb and the mammalian target of rapamycin mTOR pathway.2–7 mTOR protein functions in two different complexes called mTOR complexes 1 and 2 mTORC1 and mTORC2 . A linear TSC1 2-Rheb-mTORC1 pathway has been revealed , in which Rheb is an essential molecule mediating the effect of TSC1 2 to control mTORC1 activity.8–10 In contrast , Rheb does not directly stimulate mTORC2 activity . Excessive expression of unfolded or misfolded proteins , nutrient deprivation and calcium homeostasis perturbation cause a variety of endoplasmic reticulum ER stress conditions that can be sensed by intracellular signaling pathways collectively called the unfolded protein response UPR or ER stress.11,12 Initiation of this signaling cascade is primarily achieved by the activation of three ER stress sensors . The type I transmembrane endonuclease protein kinase inositol-requiring enzyme 1 IRE1 , PKR-like ER kinase PERK and a type II transmembrane protein called activating transcription factor 6 ATF6 11,12 collectively sense unfolded proteins in ER and elicit cellular responses , including general inhibition of protein synthesis , selective protein translation and induction of stress responsive genes . UPR is believed to be a mechanism to protect cells from unfavorable conditions . However , uncontrolled UPR can lead to apoptosis . Activation of PERK leads to phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2a eIF2a and therefore , results in reduced protein synthesis by inhibiting translation initia-tion.13,14 The phosphorylated eIF2a also selectively translates some proteins , such as the ATF4 transcription factor that in turn induces expression of stress responsive genes . The nuclease of IRE1 specifically cleaves the mRNA of a transcription factor called X-box binding protein-1 XBP-1 it removes 26 bp from the XBP-1 mRNA precursor to produce a mature form of XBP-1 mRNA , therefore stimulating XBP-1 protein expression.12,15,16 ER stress also induces site-specific proteolysis of ATF6 , and the cleaved cytoplasmic domain of ATF6 moves into the nucleus to act as a transcription factor to increase the transcription of ER chaperones.17,18 Further-more , ER stress promotes proteasome-dependent protein degradation . Failure in relief of ER stress-induced protein overload could result in cell death mediated by massive induction of proapoptotic transcription factor C EBP homo-logous protein CHOP and activation of caspase cascade.19 In this study , we investigated ER stress response in TSC mutant cells . We found that the TSC1 or TSC2 cells are sensitive to ER stress-induced apoptosis . We observed that loss of either TSC1 or TSC2 results in a truncated ER stress response . The TSC mutant cells show elevated eIF2a phosphorylation but activation of transcription factors such as ATF4 , ATF6 and CHOP are significantly reduced . As a consequence , the TSC mutant cells are much more sensitive to ER stress-induced apoptosis . The hypersensitivity to ER stress is not affected by rapamycin treatment , but suppressed by raptor knockdown , and can be mimicked by Rheb activation . These results led to the conclusion that TSC1 and TSC2 protect cells from ER stress and suggest a possibility of using ER stress agents for TSC treatment . Results TSC mutant cells are sensitive to ER stress-induced apoptosis . Previously we showed that the TSC mutant cells are sensitive to glucose starvation and undergo apoptosis during prolonged glucose deprivation.20 We conclude that this effect is due to the defects of TSC mutant cells in energy starvation response . However , glucose starvation could also cause ER stress.21 We therefore examined the effect of ER stress on TSC mutant cells . Thapsigargin is an ER calcium ATPase inhibitor and induces ER stress . We found that the TSC1 MEF cells but not the control TSC1 ? ? cells were very sensitive to thapsigargin treatment and showed a massive cell death during 18 h of treatment Figure 1a . Tunicamycin blocks protein glycosylation and is also a commonly used ER stress inducer . Tunicamycin treatment also induced a robust cell death in the TSC1 but not in the control cells Figure 1a . Knowing TSC1 cells are sensitive to thapsigargin and tunicamycin , we examined the sensitivity to MG132 , a proteasome inhibitor that also induces UPR . As expected , MG132-induced cell death in TSC1 but not the control cells Figure 1a . To determine whether the high sensitivity to ER stress is unique to TSC1 inactivation , similar experiments were performed in the TSC2 LEF cells and controls that re-express TSC2 labeled as TSC2 ? ? for convenience . Massive cell death was observed in the TSC2 cells in response to thapasigargin , tunicamycin or MG132 treatment while the TSC2 ? ? cells were not killed by similar treatments Figure 1b . Together , our data show that mutation in TSC1 or TSC2 sensitizes cells to ER stress inducers and the TSC mutant cells initiate apoptosis under ER stress conditions . The above results show that TSC1 and TSC2 normally protect cells from ER stress . Uncontrolled ER stress is known to induce apoptosis.12 To test whether the cell death induced by ER stress in the TSC cells was due to apoptosis , we determined caspase activa-tion . Site-specific cleavage of procaspase to smaller mature caspase is a hallmark of caspase activation . We found that MG132 treatment induced a dramatic increase in active cleaved caspase 12 , 9 and 3 in TSC1 cells Figure 2a . In contrast , no caspase activation was observed in the control TSC1 ? ? cells under similar treatment conditions . These data support that MG132-induced apoptosis in TSC1 cells . We also tested the effect of thapsigargin and tunicamycin . Our data showed that both ER stress inducers caused activation of caspase 12 , 9 and 3 although the effect of tunicamycin is less dramatic than thapasigargin MG TG Tm Figures 2a and b . Consistent with cell death observed in Figure 1 , ER stress-induced caspase activation in TSC2 cells as determined by the appearance of cleaved mature caspase 9 and 3 , whereas ER stress did not induce caspase activation in the control TSC2 ? ? cells Figure 2b . Caspase 12 has been implicated in ER stress-induced apoptosis to function upstream of caspase 9 , which is in the intrinsic cell death pathway.22,23 Caspase 3 functions downstream of caspase 9 and is the effector caspase involved in the execution of cell death.24,25 Our data establish that the ER stress-induced cell death in TSC mutant cells correlates with the activation of caspase 12 , 9 and 3 . ER stress is also known to induce autophagy.26 We also tested whether deletion of TSC affects the ER stress-mediated induction of autophagy , and we observed that autophagy was induced in both TSC1 and wild-type MEFs by ER stress data not shown . Elevated basal and stress-induced eIF2a phosphorylation in TSC mutant cells . Phosphorylation of eIF2a is one of the best-characterized markers for ER stress . A key physiological response to ER stress is to suppress protein synthesis , which is mediated in large part by the phosphorylation-dependent inhibition of eIF2a . TSC1 cells showed a significant level of basal eIF2a phosphorylation even under no treatment Figure 3 , an observation consistent with previous report that the TSC 0 8 12 16 20 24 0 8 12 16 20 24 Tm hrs MEFs a and TSC2 ? ? or LEFs b were incubated with MG 132 by western blotting using antibodies specific to caspase 12 , cleaved caspase 9 mutant cells are under constant ER stress because of overload of elevated protein synthesis caused by the uncontrolled mTORC1 activation.27,28 We also found that not only was the eIF2a phosphorylation increased by MG132 but also at significantly higher levels Figures 3a and b . Both thapsigargin and tunicamycin caused a stronger eIF2a phosphorylation in the TSC1 cells than the control cells as determined by western blotting Figure 3a . Similar observations were made in the TSC2 cells Figure 3b . Our data indicate that the TSC mutant cells show an elevated basal UPR and a stronger eIF2a phosphorylation induced by ER stress . TSC mutant cells show a truncated ER stress response . ER stress response protects cells to cope with unfavorable stress environment . Then , it is perplexing why the TSC mutant cells are sensitive to ER stress-induced apoptosis on one hand while these cells also show stronger eIF2a phosphorylation on the other hand . Besides eIF2a phosphorylation by PERK , activation of the three ER stress sensors also induces expression of many ER stress proteins . We examined several ER stress markers , including ATF4 , ATF6 , XBP-1 and CHOP , which have critical roles in proper ER stress response . ER stress also activates two other ER stress sensors , ATF6 and IRE1 . IRE1 activation results in expression of XBP-1 while eIF2a phosphorylation induces 0 .5 1 2 4 8 the selective translation of ATF4 . Furthermore , both ATF4 and ATF6 , two transcription factors , contribute to the expression of CHOP . Multiple ER stress responses collectively protect cells from ER stress . TSC1 ? ? or cells were treated with MG132 and nuclear fractions were collected . Western blotting with ATF4-specific antibody showed that MG132 robustly increased ATF4 protein levels in the TSC1 ? ? cells Figures 4a and b . Surprisingly , the induction of ATF4 was significantly blunted in TSC1 cells . Next , we examined the effect of MG132 on CHOP expression . Similarly , CHOP induction was significantly compromised in the TSC1 cells compared with the TSC1 ? ? control cells . Western blots were also performed for ATF6 and XBP-1 . We observed that the MG132-induced XBP-1 expression was decreased in the TSC1 cells . In contrast , the induction of ATF6 was comparable in both TSC1 ? ? and TSC1 cells . Similar experiments were performed in TSC2 cells and identical results were observed Figure 4a . Therefore , our data indicate that the induction of ER stress response , including ATF4 , CHOP and XBP-1 , is compromised in TSC mutant cells . We further analyzed the ER stress response induced by thapsigargin and tunicamycin . As expected , both compounds induced expression of ATF4 , CHOP and ATF6 in the control cells although the induction was less robust than the MG132 treatment Figures 4a and b . Importantly , the induction of these three ER stress response genes was abolished in the TSC1 cells . We did not detect XBP-1 expression by thapsigargin or tunicamycin in our western blotting . This could be due to a combination of a low sensitivity of the antibody and a weaker ER stress response induced by the two compounds . The induction of ATF4 , CHOP , ATF6 b TSC2 + + and XBP-1 were also examined in TSC2 cells and a blunted ER stress response was observed Figure 4a , suggesting that the defective ER stress response is common to both TSC1 and TSC2 cells . Our results suggest a critical role of TSC1 and TSC2 for a full range ER stress response . Moreover , the truncated ER stress response may contribute to the high ER stress-induced apoptosis in the TSC mutant cells . Reconstitution of TSC2 blocks while knockdown of TSC1 increases ER stress-induced apoptosis . To rule out the possibility that the hypersensitivity of TSC mutant cells to ER stress is due to acquired mutations other than TSC1 or TSC2 , we next re-expressed TSC2 in TSC2 LEF cells and transiently knocked down TSC1 in HeLa cells Figures 5a and e . The ER stress response was measured by western blotting for active ATF6 induction , and apoptosis was analyzed by detecting the level of cleaved caspase 9 by western blotting and by flow cytometry analysis of annexin V propidium iodide stained cells . As shown in Figure 5 , TSC2-rescued cells restored ER stress response Figure 5b and concomitantly underwent less apoptosis compared with control TSC2 cells Figures 5c and d . Although knockdown of TSC1 in HeLa cells decreased the level of active ATF6 induced by thapsigargin and tunicamycin Figure 5f , and the ER stress-induced apoptosis was increased Figures 5g and h . These results indicate that the truncated ER stress response and higher sensitivity to apoptosis in TSC mutant cells are indeed caused by the mutation of TSC1 or TSC2 , and not only in MEF but also in other cell types , such as HeLa cells . NE WCL NE WCL 15 60 Rapamycin does not protect TSC mutant cells from ER stress-induced apoptosis . Mutation in either TSC1 or TSC2 results in constitutive activation of Rheb and mTORC1 . We first analyzed the role of mTORC1 by using rapamycin , which is a potent and specific inhibitor of mTORC1 . Glucose starvation is known to induce apoptosis in TSC mutant cells.25 The glucose starvation-induced apoptosis could be effectively blocked by rapamycin Figure 6a , consistent with a critical role of high mTORC1 activation in energy starvation-induced apoptosis . To test the role of mTORC1 , rapamycin was added together with MG132 , thapsigargin or tunicamycin to treat TSC1 cells . We were surprised to find that rapamycin had little effect in protecting TSC1 cells from apoptosis induced by the ER stress Figure 6a . Western blotting for active caspase 3 supported the morphological cell death data Figure 6b . Rapamycin completely blocked the appearance of active caspase 3 in response to glucose starvation in TSC1 cells . In contrast , rapamycin did not block caspase 3 activation caused by MG132 , thapsigargin or tunicamycin . In fact , rapamycin even slightly enhanced the appearance of active caspase 3 in the TSC1 cells in response to thapsigargin and tunicamycin Figure 6b . Parallel experiments were performed with TSC2 cells and we also found that rapamycin did not protect ER stress-induced apoptosis Figures 6a and b . Quantification of apoptosis by FACS analysis further supports this conclusion Figure 6c . The above observations indicate that a rapamycin-insensitive downstream signaling pathway sensitizes TSC mutant cells to ER stress . Higher apoptosis induced by ER stress in TSC mutant cells is Rheb and raptor-dependent . We next tested the effect of the Rheb GTPase , which is a direct target of TSC1 TSC2 . We stably overexpressed calmodulin-binding protein CBP epitope-tagged wild type or constitutively active Rheb S16H in HeLa cells Figure 7a . We were unable to generate HeLa cells that stably overexpress dominant-negative Rheb S20N because we could not detect the expression of dominant-negative Rheb after hygromycin B selection . Active Rheb overexpression or Rheb knockdown MEFs were also generated as confirmed by western blotting with Rheb-specific antibody Figure 7d . The induction of apoptosis by different ER stress inducers in these cells was examined . Overexpression or knockdown of Rheb did not induce apoptosis under normal culture conditions Figures 7b–d . However , expression of wild type and active Rheb-induced activation of caspase 9 and caspase 3 when cells were treated with MG132 , thapsigargin or tunicamycin , supporting a role of Rheb in ER stress Figures 7b and d , and active Rheb showed a more dramatic effect as shown by higher level of cleaved caspase 9 and higher proportion of cell death measured by FACS analysis Figures 7b and c . In contrast , knockdown of Rheb did not sensitize cells to thapsigargin-or tunicamycin-induced apoptosis Figure 7d . It is worth noting that Rheb knockdown did sensitize cells to MG132 Figure 7d . Given the fact that MG132 causes global accumulation of ubiquitinated protein , the effect of MG132 could be broader than ER stress . Together , our data indicate that high Rheb activity sensitizes cells to ER stress , supporting a notion that the high Rheb activity in the TSC mutants is responsible for the ER stress-induced apoptosis . Although the ER stress-induced apoptosis in TSC mutant cells is rapamycin-insensitive , it is still possible that mTORC1 is involved . We further examined whether raptor is required for ER stress hypersensitivity in the TSC mutant cells . We performed raptor knockdown in TSC1 MEFs , and raptor protein knockdown and decrease in S6K phosphorylation was confirmed Figure 8a . We tested ER stress response and apoptosis in raptor knockdown and control TSC1 MEFs when treated with medium , thapsigargin or tunicamycin . Surprisingly , when raptor was knockdown , the TSC mutant cells restored ER stress response as shown by similar ATF6 activation as in the TSC1 ? ? MEFs Figures 4a and 8b and simultaneously , TSC mutant cells were protected from apoptosis induced by thapsigargin and tunicamycin Figures 8c and d . Taken together , our data suggest a raptor-dependent rapamycin-insensitive function of mTORC is responsible for hypersensitivity to ER stress in TSC mutant cells . Discussion The TSC1 TSC2 tumor suppressor complex functions as GTPase-activating protein GAP toward Rheb , which is a potent and direct activator of mTORC1 . In TSC mutant cells , mTORC1 is constitutively active , therefore stimulates transla-tion and promotes cell growth . The TSC-Rheb-mTOR path-way integrates a wide range of intracellular signals to coordinate cell growth with cellular environment . Under unfavorable conditions , activation of TSC1 TSC2 would inhibit unwanted cell growth , and thus protect cells from harmful conditions . In this report , we showed that TSC1 and TSC2 are required for a full range ER stress response and function to protect cells from ER stress-induced apoptosis . Interestingly , this function of TSC1 TSC2 is mediated by Rheb and raptor , but in a manner insensitive to rapamycin inhibition . Different from conventional kinase inhibitor , rapamycin forms a com-plex with FKBP12 then binds to the FRB domain in mTOR to inhibit the ability of mTORC1 to phosphorylate downstream substrates , such as S6K1 . Therefore , rapamycin does not directly inhibit the intrinsic mTOR kinase activity . Interestingly , Choo et al.29 showed that a rapamycin-resistant mTORC1 activity is required for 4EBP1 phosphorylation under some conditions , showing that not all functions of mTORC1 are inhibited by rapamycin . Our study indicates that a rapamycin-insensitive mTORC1 activity may be responsible for the hypersensitivity to ER stress in the TSC mutant cells . A potential function of TSC in ER stress response has been suggested . Ozcan et al.28showed that TSC mutant cells have higher basal eIF2a phosphorylation and higher apoptosis in response to ER stress . These investigators concluded that the elevated ER stress response contributes to cell death in the TSC mutant cells . However , besides eIF2a phosphorylation other ER stress response markers were not examined . Our study showed that the TSC mutant cells show a defective ER stress response , as indicated by the blunted induction of ATF4 , ATF6 and CHOP although higher level of eIF2a TSC2 -- TSC2 -- 1.19 2.61 1.51 32.1 1.54 Control TSC1 phosphorylation occurred . We suggest that the incomplete ER stress response in TSC mutant cells fails to protect cells from unfolded protein stress and contributes to the high level of apoptosis under ER stress . CHOP has been implicated in ER stress-induced apoptosis . Surprisingly , we observed that CHOP induction is abolished in TSC mutant cells in response to thapasigargin and tunicamy-cin , yet the TSC cells show a massive apoptosis . These data indicate that CHOP induction is not required for apoptosis induced by ER stress , at least in the TSC mutant cells . Furthermore , our data suggest that a normal function of CHOP induction a moderate induction by ER stress may protect rather than kill cells . Only when expressed at a very high level , CHOP may contribute to apoptosis . This function of CHOP is similar to p53 , of which a moderate induction protects cells by stopping cell cycle while a massive p53 induction promotes apoptosis.19,30 The cell-protecting func-tion of TSC1 or TSC2 is likely to be cell type independent . For example , the TSC1 mutant neurons also show hypersensiti-vity to ER stress.31 We found that TSC mutant cells showed a truncated ER stress response . The TSC1 or TSC2 cells show elevated basal and stress-induced eIF2a phosphorylation , which is catalyzed by PERK . However , there are three ER stress sensors , IRE1 , ATF6 and PERK . In TSC mutant cells , the induction of ATF4 , ATF6 and CHOP are severely compromised in response to ER stress . XBP-1 induction by MG132 treatment is also diminished . These observations indicate that the TSC mutant cells showed a partial ER stress response as indicated by the elevated eIF2a phosphorylation but decreased induction of other ER stress markers . High eIF2a phosphorylation is implicated to promote translation of selective mRNAs , such as ATF4 . However , ATF4 is not induced in TSC mutant cells although eIF2a phosphorylation is high , indicating a possibly uncoupling between early ER stress response and the late ER stress events in the TSC mutant cells . MG132 inhibits proteasome-mediated degrada-tion and causes a general UPR , including ER stress response . The TSC mutant cells similarly show hypersensitivity to MG132 . We suggest that the incomplete ER stress response in the TSC mutant cells contributes to the high sensitivity to ER stress . Hyperactivation of mTORC1 has been shown to contribute , to much of the abnormality in the TSC mutant cells . As a potent inhibitor of mTORC1 , rapamycin has been implicated as a potential drug for TSC treatment.32 Interestingly , rapamycin does not protect TSC mutant cells from ER stress-induced apoptosis . In contrast , rapamycin potently protects TSC mutant cells from glucose starvation-induced apoptosis . However , the high sensitivity to ER stress in TSC mutant cells is Rheb-and raptor-dependent , indicating a rapamycin-insensitive activity of mTORC1 in ER stress-induced cell death . Recent studies have indicated that rapamycin may inhibit some but not all mTORC1 func-tions.29,33 The rapamycin-FKBP12 complex may interfere with phosphorylation of some but not all mTORC1 substrates . Thus , it will be interesting to examine how raptor has a role in response to ER stress and what new substrates of mTORC1 are involved . A role of Rheb in ER stress response is clearly supported by the observation that increased Rheb activity sensitizes cells to ER stress and Rheb knockdown abolished the apoptosis induction by thapsigargin and tunicamycin . Future studies to elucidate the mechanism of Rheb-and mTORC1-dependent function downstream of TSC1 TSC2 in cellular regulation would provide new insights into the mechanisms of TSC1 and TSC2 in normal cell growth regulation , stress response and tumorigenesis . Our study further supports the critical function of the TSC1 and TSC2 tumor suppressor genes in coordinating cell growth with extracellular and intracellular signals . A key physiological TSC1 -- function of TSC1 and TSC2 is to provide a protection mechanism for cells in response to unfavorable conditions . As the TSC mutant cells are highly sensitive to ER stress , ER stress agents , which can selectively kill TSC cells , could be used for TSC treatment . Velcade is a proteasome inhibitor approved by FDA as a cancer drug . We speculate that Velcade may also have a beneficial effect for TSC . Consis-tently , we have observed that injection of Velcade induces apoptosis in TSC1 liver cells in a TSC1 tissue-specific knockout mouse model data not shown . Rapamycin mainly TSC2 -- 0.43 0.55 9.81 22.7 0.32 0.35 PI 10.8 6.7 10.8 14.4 1.16 4.88 0.87 4.5 provides cytostatic effect to inhibit TSC tumor growth . Given the fact that rapamycin does not suppress ER stress-induced apoptosis in TSC mutant cells , a combination of rapamycin to inhibit TSC cell growth and Velcade to induce TSC cell apoptosis could be considered for TSC treatment . Moreover , our studies also suggest that Velcade may be more effective for cancers that have low TSC1 or TSC2 activity , such as those with activated PI3K-AKT that inhibits TSC2 .

20671747	L Farhana1,2 , MI Dawson3 , F Murshed4 and JA Fontana* , 1,2 The ability of a novel class of compounds , termed adamantyl-substituted retinoid-related molecules ARRs by several investigators to induce apoptosis in malignant cells has been well documented.1,2 While inducing death of malignant cells , several studies have documented that these compounds have no detrimental effects on normal cells.3,4 In addition , ST1926 , an analog of the parent compound CD437 , is now undergoing Phase I clinical trials.3 We have previously shown the ability of the retinoid-related molecule 4-3-Cl-1-adamantyl -4-hydroxyphenyl -3-chlorocinnamic acid 3-Cl-AHPC to induce apoptosis in a number of malignant cell types.5 Furthermore , we and others have also reported that apoptosis induction by 3-Cl-AHPC requires NF-kB activation.1,6 NF-kB represents a complex family of proteins that have key roles in a variety of cellular processes , including oncogenesis , proliferation , inflammatory and stress respon-ses as well as apoptosis.7,8 The NF-kB family consists of p50 , p52 , RelA p65 , c-Rel and RelB.7,8 Recent investigations have documented the presence of the following three major NF-kB-activating pathways.7,8 1 A canonical pathway in which external stimuli through a number of intracellular cas-cades activate the IkB kinase IKK complex that in turn phos-phorylates IkB and p105 followed by their polyubiquitination by the SCFbTrCP E3 ligase complex and their subsequent destruction . These events in turn result in the release of p50 , p65 and c-Rel their localization in the nucleus formation of heterodimers and modulation of gene transcription . 2 A noncanonical pathway involving the processing of NF-kB2 p100 to generate p52-containing complexes preceded by NF-kB-inducing kinase NIK activation of a unique IKK signalo-some consisting of IKKa homodimers.7,8 3 DNA damage or oxygen stress induced NF-kB activation using an IKK-independent process.9 Numerous studies using in vitro as well as in vivo model systems have documented a role for NF-kB in cell survival and the inhibition of cellular apoptosis.10–12 Knockout of RelA resulted in an embryonic lethal phenotype in transgenic mice because of RelA’s failure to inhibit tumor necrosis factor TNF -induced hepatocyte apoptosis.10 More-over , NF-kB was shown to block TNF-mediated apoptosis in a number of malignant and nonmalignant cell lines.11 More recent studies have strongly suggested that NF-kB activation under specific situations may have an important role in the induction of apoptosis in certain cell types . Many of the studies examined the effects of inhibition of NF-kB activation on apoptosis induction and have shown that NF-kB inhibition blocked cellular apoptosis.1 Other studies have shown that NF-kB activation by a number of therapeutic agents promoted cell death.13 NF-kB activation by doxorubi-cin and daunorubicin in U2OS osteosarcoma cells promoted cell death.13 Similar observations were made in colorectal carcinoma cell lines where activation of NF-kB was required for doxorubicin induction of apoptosis in these cells.13 Although some observations have suggested that NF-kB-mediated induction of apoptosis may be related to the activation of specific family members , other studies have suggested that this is not the case and that family members such as c-Rel and RelA can function as both pro-apoptotic or anti-apoptotic agents depending upon the context in which NF-kB is activated.14 Here , we delineated the path-ways by which 3-Cl-AHPC activates NF-kB . We also show that maximum 3-Cl-AHPC-mediated apoptosis and NF-kB activation require the combined activation of both IKKa in the noncanonical and IKKb in the canonical pathways . 3-Cl-AHPC mediates the enhanced expression of NIK , which then activates IKKa . Activated IKKa results in the phosphory-lation and processing of NF-kB2p100 and the subsequent generation and nuclear translocation of p52 . fold 2.5 3-Cl-AHPC activates the canonical and noncanonical NF-jB pathways . We found that inhibition of 3-Cl-AHPC-mediated NF-kB activation in human DU145 prostate and MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cells blocked 3-Cl-AHPC induction of apoptosis.1 We examined the role of NF-kB activation in 3-Cl-AHPC apoptosis induction in KG-1 human leukemia cells using the NF-kB inhibitor JSH-23 that selectively blocks nuclear translocation of the NF-kB p65 RelA subunit and its transcriptional activity.15 Treatment with 3-Cl-AHPC resulted in a twofold NF-kB activation at 24 h in KG-1 cells Figure 1a . Inhibition of this activation by JSH-23 resulted in a 35 % inhibition of 3-Cl-AHPC-mediated apoptosis Figure 1b . JSH-23 only blocks the NF-kB canonical pathway and not the noncanonical pathway that is still activated in the JSH-23-and 3-Cl-AHPC-treated cells both pathways contribute to maximal apoptosis see below , thus the noncanonical pathway still enhances apoptosis even in the presence of JSH-23 . We have previously shown that 3-Cl-AHPC treatment of DU145 and MDA-MB-468 cells resulted in the IKKa kinase activation at 24 h as indicated by the increased phosphorylation of GST-IkBa.1 3-Cl-AHPC activation of IKKb kinase was not noted at 24 h . Phosphory-lation of the activation loops of IKKa and IKKb has been associated with their conformational change and IKK kinase activation.7,16 We examined 3-Cl-AHPC activation of IKKa and IKKb by assessing 3-Cl-AHPC-mediated phosphory-lation of their activation loops at both early and late time points . 3-Cl-AHPC treatment of MDA-MB-468 cells resulted in rapid IKKb activation with maximum phosphorylation 7.5-fold noted at 6 h and its decrease to 3-fold at 24 h and total loss at 48 h Figure 1c and Supplementary Figure S1a . 3-Cl-AHPC enhanced IKKa phosphorylation in MDA-MB-468 cells by 1.5-fold at 6 and 24 h with maximum IKKa phosphorylation 3.2-fold occurring at 48 h after the addition of 3-Cl-AHPC Figure 1c and Supplementary Figure S1a . 3-Cl-AHPC-mediated IKKb phosphorylation in KG-1 cells displayed a similar pattern to that noted in MDA-MB-468 cells with a 5.2-fold increase noted at 6 h and 2.9-fold increase noted at 24 h after 3-Cl-AHPC exposure Figure 1c and Supplementary Figure S1a . Basal IKKa activation loop phosphorylation was observed before 3-Cl-AHPC exposure in KG-1 cells . Enhanced IKKa phosphorylation was noted at 6 h 1.4-fold , 24 h 1.2-fold and 48 h 1.2-fold after the addition of 3-Cl-AHPC Figure 1c and Supplementary Figure S1a . 3-Cl-AHPC activation of the canonical pathway was documented by increased phosphorylation of the NF-kB p65 RelA at Ser276 , whereas its activation of the noncano-nical pathway was documented by phosphorylation of NF-kB2p100 and generation of p52 Figures 1d and e . Exposure of MDA-MB-468 to 3-Cl-AHPC was accompanied by increased phosphorylation of NF-kB2p100 with maximal phosphorylation noted at 24 and 6 h in MDA-MB-468 and KG-1 cells , respectively Figure 1e . In both cell lines , there were associated and correlated increases in the NF-kB2p100 levels and the p52 levels Figure 1e . Activation of the noncanonical pathway has been shown to generate an increase in RelB p52 heterodimer levels with the binding to unique consensus sequences.17 3-Cl-AHPC-mediated activation of the noncanonical pathway also resulted in the markedly increased RelB levels and the binding of RelB to NF-kB2p100 p52 Figure 1f . Inhibition of the 3-Cl-AHPC-mediated activation of either the canonical or noncanonical pathways blocks 3-Cl - AHPC-mediated apoptosis . Ablation of IKKa , IKKb or IKKg in mouse embryonic fibroblast MEF cells resulted in decreases of 99 , 95 and 85 % , respectively , in the 3-Cl-AHPC-mediated apoptosis at 48 h Figures 2a and b . Knockout of IKKb and IKKg of MEF control cells showed 30 and 35 % apoptosis , respectively 3-Cl-AHPC enhanced only 2 and 7 % apoptosis in IKKb and IKKg cells , respectively , whereas it enhanced 52 % apoptosis in wild-type cells at 48 h . Thus , activation of both IKKa and IKKb were required for maximal 3-Cl-AHPC-mediated apoptosis in the MEF cells Figures 2a and b . We also examined the effect of IKKa and IKKb knockdown on 3-Cl-AHPC-mediated apoptosis in MDA-MB-468 cells . Knockdown of IKKa and IKKb was accomplished in MDA-MB-468 cells using small-hairpin sh RNA-IKKa and shRNA-IKKb as described in Materials and Methods section Supplementary Figure S1b . We found that knockdown of IKKa or IKKb resulted in an approximately 50 % reduction in 3-Cl-AHPC-mediated apoptosis in the MDA-MB-468 cells Figures 2c and d . Thus activation of both IKKa and IKKb is required for maximal 3-Cl-AHPC-mediated apoptosis in both MEF and MDA-MB-468 cells . As expected , knockdown in IKKa and IKKb levels resulted in decreased phosphorylated IKKa and IKKb levels in MDA-MB-468 cells after exposure to 3-Cl-AHPC Figure 3a . We next examined the effect of knockdown of IKKa and IKKb on 3-Cl-AHPC-mediated NF-kB2p100 phosphorylation in MDA-MB-468 cells . Knockdown of IKKb had no effect on 3-Cl-AHPC-mediated NF-kB2p100 phosphorylation , whereas knockdown of IKKa delayed NF-kB2p100 phosphorylation to 48 h and decreased the levels of phosphorylated NF-kB2p100 Figure 3b . Total inhibition of NF-kB2p100 phosphorylation would not be expected because activated IKKa was still present but at reduced levels . The role of the NIK in the activation of the NF-kB noncanonical pathway has been well demonstrated.17,18 We therefore assessed the effect of 3-Cl-AHPC exposure on NIK levels . We found that incubation of MDA-MB-468 cells with 3-Cl-AHPC resulted in a sixfold increase in the NIK levels Figure 3c . NIK expression in cells has been found to be tightly regulated by c-IAP1 and c-IAP2.18 The E-3 ligases c-IAP1 and c-IAP2 have been found to inhibit NIK expression through its destruction by means of the proteasome pathway and thus inhibit activation of the NF-kB noncanonical path-way.19 As expected , inhibition of the proteasome pathway resulted in a marked increase in NIK levels in the absence and presence of 3-Cl-AHPC Figure 3d . Recent reports suggest that c-IAP1 and c-IAP2 degradation of NIK requires the formation of a regulatory complex containing c-IAP1 , c-IAP2 , TNF receptor-associated factors TRAFs TRAF2 and TRAF3 with subsequent binding of NIK.20–22 TRAF2 and TRAF3 appear to have separate and unique roles.20,22 Exposure of MDA-MB-468 cells to 3-Cl-AHPC resulted in increased expression of TRAF2 and TRAF3 but only an increase in TRAF3 levels was noted in KG-1 cells after the addition of 3-Cl-AHPC Figure 3e , which was accompanied by decreased binding of NIK by TRAF2 Figure 3e . Interestingly , a significant decrease in binding of c-IAP1 by TRAF3 but not by TRAF2 in MDA-MB-468 cells occurred after 3-Cl-AHPC exposure Figure 4a . Increase in NIK levels in the cells after exposure to 3-Cl-AHPC was preceded by a decrease in c-IAP1 and XIAP levels within 6 h Figure 4b . We therefore hypothesized that the 3-Cl-AHPC-mediated decrease of c-IAP1 levels had a major role in the PI and 50 % 40 20 Annexin 10 associated increase in NIK levels . We assessed the effect of c-IAP1 overexpression on 3-Cl-AHPC-mediated activation of the noncanonical pathway and apoptosis induction in MDA-MB-468 cells . Elevated c-IAP1 levels inhibited 3-Cl-AHPC-mediated apoptosis as well as 3-Cl-AHPC-mediated increase in NIK levels Figures 4c–e Supplementary Figure S2a . We examined the potential mechanisms by which 3-Cl-AHPC inhibited c-IAP1 levels using inhibitors to the proteasome MG-132 , lysosomal CA074Me and caspase ZVAD-fmk pathways . Inhibition of the proteasome pathway did not block 3-Cl-AHPC-mediated decrease of c-IAP1 levels Supplemen-tary Figure S2b and apoptosis Supplementary Figure S2c in MDA-MB-468 cells . In addition , there was no evidence of c-IAP1 ubiquitination after 3-Cl-AHPC exposure data not shown . Use of an inhibitor of the lysosomal pathway , CA074Me , also had no effect on 3-Cl-AHPC-mediated decrease in c-IAP1 levels Supplementary Figure S2d . Treat-ment of the cells with the proteasome or lysosomal inhibitors resulted in the degradation of c-IAP1 , whereas the addition of the caspase pathway inhibitor ZVAD-fmk completely blocked 3-Cl-AHPC-mediated decrease of c-IAP1 levels Supplemen-tary Figure S2d . Role of Cdc37 in 3-Cl-AHPC-mediated IKK phosphory - lation . We have previously shown that 3-Cl-AHPC-mediated IKK activation is associated with the enhanced binding of HSP90 binding to IKKa.1 The association of chaperones Cdc37 and HSP90 with the IKK complex is required for ligand-mediated IKK activation , including TNFa-mediated IKK activation.8,23 It has been shown that Cdc37 recruits HSP90 to the IKK complex through the direct interaction between Cdc37 and the catalytic region of IKKa b.23 Exposure of MDA-MB-468 cells to 3-Cl-AHPC resulted in the increased binding of Cdc37 to IKKa at 6h Figure 5a this was accompanied by an enhanced association between Cdc37 to HSP90 Figure 5a . We therefore examined whether Cdc37 has a role in 3-Cl-AHPC-mediated IKKa b activation and induction of apoptosis using shRNA to decrease Cdc37 expression in MDA-MB-468 cells Supplementary Figure S2e . Knockdown of Cdc37 inhibited 3-Cl-AHPC-mediated phosphorylation of both IKKa and IKKb Figure 5b and inhibited both 3-Cl-AHPC-and TNFa-mediated NF-kB activation in cells Figure 5c as well as 3-Cl-AHPC-mediated apoptosis in MDA-MB-468 cells Figure 5d . In addition , knockdown of Cdc37 levels in MDA-MB-468 cells markedly inhibited 3-Cl-AHPC-mediated enhanced HSP90 binding to IKKa Figure 5e . Thus , the recruitment by Cdc37 of HSP90 to the IKKs is essential for 3-Cl-AHPC-mediated NF-kB activation and the induction of apoptosis . TNFa-mediates IKK phosphorylation in MDA-MB-468 and KG-1 cells . TNFa exposure resulted in IKKb phosphory-lation and activation at 6 h in MDA-MB-468 and KG-1 cells with the absence of IKKb phosphorylation noted at 24 h Figure 6a . No activation of IKKa was noted in the TNFa-exposed MDA-MB-468 cells . KG-1 cells express constitu-tively phosphorylated IKKa that was not modulated by the presence of TNFa in the KG-1 cells Figure 6a however , there was a significant increase in IKKb phosphorylation activation . Exposure to TNFa did not result in modulation of XIAP , c-IAP1 or phospho-Bad levels as noted after 3-Cl-AHPC exposure in either the MDA-MB-468 or KG-1 cells Figure 6b . In addition , TNFa exposure did not result in significant apoptosis induction in either MDA-MB-468 or KG-1 cells Figures 6c and d . Thus , despite TNFa-mediated increase in IKKb phosphorylation and activation and the presence of constitutively phosphorylated activated IKKa in KG-1 , neither was there induction of apoptosis Figures 6a and c nor was there a decrease in c-IAP1 , XIAP or phospho-Bad levels in these cells Figure 6b . These results imply that in addition to 3-Cl-AHPC-enhanced IKKa and IKKb phosphorylation activation , additional 3-Cl-AHPC-mediated events must occur for the induction of apoptosis . Discussion NF-kB is well known to function in an anti-apoptotic manner , but we have previously reported that 3-Cl-AHPC-mediated apoptosis requires NF-kB activation.1 Here , we showed that 3-Cl-AHPC-mediated phosphorylation and activation of both IKKa and IKKb are required for maximal 3-Cl-AHPC apoptosis induction . Knockout and knockdown of either IKKa or IKKb inhibited 3-Cl-AHPC-mediated apoptosis in MEF as well as in MDA-MB-468 cells . We found that 3-Cl-AHPC induction of IKKa and IKKb phosphorylation displayed significantly different time courses . Furthermore , 3-Cl-AHPC-mediated IKKa and IKKb phosphorylation activation were independent of each other knockdown of IKKb had no effect on 3-Cl-AHPC-mediated IKKa phosphorylation activation . We have previously shown that HSP90 is required for 3-Cl-AHPC activation of IKKa and IKKb.1 We have now shown that Cdc37 is also essential for 3-Cl-AHPC-mediated IKKa and IKKb activation inhibition of Cdc37 expression resulted in decreased association of IKKa with HSP90 as well as inhibition of 3-Cl-AHPC-mediated apoptosis . 3-Cl-AHPC enhanced NIK expression resulted in the increased binding of NIK to TRAF3 . We speculate that the complex of NIK and TRAF3 resulted in the activation of IKKa through NIK phosphorylation of IKKa . A number of investigators have documented that IKKb-mediated NF-kB activation occurs through the canonical pathway , whereas IKKa-mediated NF-kB activation occurs primarily through the noncanonical pathway.18,24,25 NIK is usually expressed at extremely low levels in cells.25 TRAF3 that possesses ubiquitin E3 ligase activity targets NIK degradation through the proteasome pathway , and the induction of the non-canonical pathway involves TRAF3 degradation with the associated enhancement of NIK expression.24–26 We have found that MDA-MB-468 exposure to 3-Cl-AHPC resulted in increased NIK expression , which was accompanied by increases in TRAF2 and TRAF3 levels . NIK was found to phosphorylate the T-loop serine of IKKa resulting in IKKa activation with the subsequent IKKa-mediated phos-phorylation of NF-kB2p100 at the C-terminal serines to trigger ubiquitination and proteasomal processing of NF-kB2p100.18,24 3-Cl-AHPC-enhanced NIK expression resulted in IKKa activation with concomitant NF-kB2p100 phosphorylation , which was accompanied by increased p52 levels . Interestingly , we found an increase in NF-kB2p100 levels rather than a decrease during 3-Cl-AHPC-enhanced phosphorylation degradation of NF-kB2p100 . A similar observation was made by Varfolomeev et al.26 who found there was a progressive increase in NF-kB2p100 and p52 levels after treatment of EVSA-T human breast carcinoma cells with an IAP antagonist . Lombardi et al.27 found that the NF-kBp65 subunit enhances the activation of the NF-kB2 promoter . We have previously reported that 3-Cl-AHPC enhances IkBa degradation through the proteasome pathway with the release of the NF-kBp65 subunit and its translocation to the nucleus . Thus , we speculate that 3-Cl-AHPC activation of p65 may result in enhanced NF-kB2p100 expression . TRAF3 has been found to be associated with NIK , which allows it to recruit TRAF2 along with associated c-IAP1 or c-IAP2 . The recruited c-IAP1 or c-IAP2 can then catalyze NIK ubiquitination and degradation.20,21,26 Thus , the 3-Cl-AHPC-mediated decrease in c-IAP1 levels may result in enhanced NIK levels and IKKa activation . c-IAP1 and c-IAP2 as well as XIAP appear to have essential roles in genotoxic stress-induced NF-kB activation.28 XIAP regulates the activation of the upstream kinase TAK1 and couples activated TAK1 to the IKK complex . XIAP expression is essential for camptothecin-and etoposide-mediated NF-kB activation . c-IAP1 mediated NEMO ubiquitination in the same pathway , whereas c-IAP2 regulated a downstream event and was also essential for camptothecin-and etoposide-mediated as well as doxorubi-cin-mediated NF-kB activation.28 Valli et al.3 have shown that ST1926 and CD437 , analogs of 3-Cl-AHPC , induce DNA double-strand breaks in the acute myelogenous cell line NB4 these investigators speculated that this may be the mechan-ism by which ST1926 and CD437 induce cell death . The fact that 3-Cl-AHPC inhibits the expression of c-IAP1 as well as delineated . The involvement of signaling complexes including TRAF2 , TANK and TBK1 are also under study.39 Our results reveal that NF-kB activation contributes a role in ARR-mediated apoptotic pathway and activation of both NF-kB pathways was required for maximal 3-Cl-AHPC-mediated apoptosis .

20689554	Muscle satellite cells are the resident stem cells of skeletal muscle and supply myonuclei for postnatal muscle growth , and for maintenance and repair in adult.1 Satellite cells are located on the surface of myofibres and are mitotically quiescent in healthy adult muscle . In response to cues for routine myofibre homoeostasis or hypertrophy , or the spora-dic demands of muscle repair , satellite cells are activated to generate myoblasts that proliferate and eventually undergo myogenic differentiation to provide new myonuclei . Satellite cells also self-renew , thus maintaining a population of quiescent , undifferentiated precursors available to respond to repeated demand.2–4 Satellite cell function is controlled by various regulatory pathways , chief amongst them being Notch Delta and Wnt signalling.1 Many of these same regulatory networks also control embryonic myogenesis , in addition to many other processes , both during development and repair in adult . Another important network for organising embryonic and foetal myogenesis involves the Bone morphogenetic proteins BMPs . BMPs belong to the transforming growth factor-b family and initiate signalling by binding to the transmembrane type 1 and type 2 BMP receptors BMPRs . On BMP binding , type 1 and 2 receptors complex on the cell surface , allowing the constitutively active kinase of the type 2 receptor to transphosphorylate the type 1 receptor.5 This in turn phos-phorylates the R-Smads – Smad1 , Smad5 and Smad8 pSmad1 5 8 – which translocate to the nucleus to regulate transcription of target genes including Ids.6–8 Inhibitor of differentiation DNA-binding Id proteins comprising Id1 , 2 , 3 , 4 bind ubiquitously expressed E-proteins to form inactive heterodimers , thereby preventing the same E-proteins from binding with tissue-specific transcription factors such as MyoD and myogenin , a step necessary for their efficient function.9 BMP signalling can be modified in a number of ways , including through secreted antagonists such as Noggin , which bind BMPs with high affinity to interfere with interactions between BMPs and their receptors.5 Although crucial for bone and cartilage formation and repair , 5,10 BMPs also inhibit myogenic differentiation to prevent ectopic myogenesis in the lateral plate mesoderm . In the dermomyotome , however , BMP signalling itself must be inhibited , to permit the onset of myogenesis.11–14 BMPs not only impede myogenic differentiation in immortalised myogenic cell lines e.g. , C2 and primary myogenic cells in vitro but also induce osteoblastic gene expression and differentiation towards the osteoblast lineage.15–18 Interest-ingly , although able to express early markers of osteogenic differentiation such as alkaline phosphatase , many primary myogenic cells also retain expression of proteins associated with myogenesis e.g. , Pax7 and MyoD after exposure to BMPs for several days.15,17 As intramuscular injection of certain BMPs e.g. , BMP2 and BMP4 can lead to ectopic bone formation in vivo , 19,20 these in vitro observations were thought to provide mechanistic insight into Fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva FOP , a rare disorder of skeletal malformations and progressive extra-skeletal ossification in muscle . FOP is caused by a mutation in ALK-2 , which renders this BMPR type 1 BMPR-1 constitutively active , 19 and inhibition of this mutant ALK-2 reduces ossification.21 How-ever , Lounev et al.20 have recently shown that few o5 % muscle progenitors actually contribute to BMP-induced heterotopic ossification in vivo . In this study , we investigated the role of BMP signalling in satellite cell function during adult myogenesis . During activa-tion and proliferation , satellite cells robustly express BMPR-1A Alk-3 , with pSmad1 5 8 and Smad4 present in their nuclei , indicative of operational BMP signalling . Exogenous BMP4 can sustain satellite cell division and reduce differ-entiation , with BMP4 functioning through BMPR-1A . Con-versely , antagonising the interaction of BMP with its receptors or perturbing intracellular BMP signalling by either inhibiting Smad1 5 8 phosphorylation or reducing Smad5 or Smad4 levels , all induced premature differentiation . Manipulation of BMP signalling affected Id1 levels a known inhibitor of differentiation that regulates the function of the myogenic regulatory factors that comprise of Myf5 , MyoD , myogenin and MRF4 through sequestration of E-proteins . Satellite cell progeny then upregulate the BMP antagonist Noggin as they differentiate , and knockdown of Noggin enhanced prolifera-tion and impeded differentiation . As blockade of BMP signalling after muscle injury hindered regeneration , our observations show that BMP signalling is a potent regulator of routine satellite cell function in adult . Results BMP pathway proteins are present in activated and proliferating satellite cells . Satellite cell function can be modelled in vitro . On stimulation by mitogen-rich medium termed plating or proliferation medium here , isolated Pax7-expressing quiescent satellite cells are activated and upregulate MyoD . Satellite cells then proliferate , before either downregulating Pax7 , maintaining MyoD , inducing myogenin and proceeding to differentiate , or downregulating MyoD and maintaining Pax7 , to return to a quiescent-like state , modelling self-renewal.2,3 To first determine the expression profile of BMPR-1A , we immunostained satellite cells retained in their niche on myofibres isolated from the extensor digitorum longus EDL muscle . BMPR-1A was undetectable in the vast majority of quiescent satellite cells on freshly isolated T0 myofibres Figure 1a . However , after culturing in plating medium for 48 T48 or 72 h T72 , BMPR-1A became robustly expressed in activated and proliferating satellite cells Figure 1a . BMPR-1B was not detectable by Q-PCR data not shown , consistent with its absence in C2C12 myoblasts.22 Intracellular BMP signalling through BMPR-1A operates by phosphorylation of the carboxyl terminal of R-Smad proteins . Immunostaining for either pSmad1 5 8 or Smad5 , revealed a strong nuclear signal in activated and proliferating T48 and T72 , but not quiescent T0 , satellite cells Figure 1b and c . The common-mediator Smad Co-Smad Smad4 , which facilitates translocation of Smad1 5 8 to the nucleus and promotes their transcriptional activity , 5 was also present in the nuclei of activated satellite cells Figure 1c . Thus , the expression dynamics of BMPR-1A , pSmad1 5 8 , Smad4 and Smad5 mirror each other , and indicate that BMP signalling is operating in activated and proliferating satellite cells . As Noggin-mediated BMP antagonism contributes to initiation of the myogenic programme during embryo-genesis , 13 we hypothesised that Noggin may also modify BMP signalling in satellite cells . Noggin was undetectable in quiescent T0 , and at low levels in activated Pax7 ? , satellite cells Figure 2a and b . In contrast , Noggin was highly expressed by differentiating myoblasts at T72 , as shown by co-immunostaining for Noggin and myogenin Figure 2b . Culturing satellite cells attached to a myofibre provides a useful model for studying satellite cell activation , proliferation and the initial stages of differentiation . Later events , such as myoblast fusion into large multi-nucleated myotubes , how-ever , are better studied in satellite cells isolated from their associated myofibre and plated onto Matrigel-coated culture dishes . Such plated satellite cell-derived myoblasts cultured in differentiation medium for 2 days clearly exhibited high Noggin levels in myotubes and other Pax7 cells Figure 2c and d . BMP regulates the balance between proliferation and differentiation in satellite cells . We next examined the effects of stimulating BMP signalling , and used administration of recombinant BMP4 to achieve this , as it is present in serum.23 Addition of recombinant BMP4 protein 100 ng ml to EDL satellite cells retained in their niche on the myofibre significantly increased the number of Pax7 ? MyoD ? satellite cells , but decreased the number of cells with the differentiating Pax7 MyoD ? phenotype Figure 3a . Inhibition of differentiation by BMP4 was confirmed by co-immunostaining for myogenin and Pax7 Figure 3b . Plating medium contains chick embryo extract and horse serum , hence is rich in growth factors , and also contains BMP4.23 Under these culture conditions , satellite cell proliferation is likely to be near maximal hence , addition of BMP4 did not further increase cell division Figure 3a and b . As satellite cells retained expression of genes associated with myogenesis , these short exposures to BMP4 did not induce any obvious loss of myogenic identity . To interfere with BMP binding to its receptors , we added recombinant Noggin protein 50 ng ml or soluble BMPR-1A fragments sBMPR-1Af 200 ng ml to cultures of satellite cells associated with a myofibre for 72 h . Exposure to either Noggin or sBMPR-1Af resulted in a significant reduction in the mean total satellite cell number per myofibre , particularly of cells with the Pax7 ? MyoD ? phenotype Figure 3a . Numbers of differentiating Pax7 MyoD ? cells were already increased at T48 , and became the predominant phenotype at T72 , signifying a precocious onset of differentiation Figure 3a . There were also significantly fewer self-renewing Pax7 ? MyoD cells present at T72 Figure 3a . Co-immunos-taining for Pax7 and myogenin confirmed that both Noggin and sBMPR-1Af enhanced differentiation , revealing a significant increase in cells with the Pax7 myogenin ? phenotype Figure 3b . These effects were not restricted to satellite cells from somite-derived muscles , as those from the branchiomeric masseter muscle , which has a different embryonic origin , 24 also exhibited fewer differentiating Pax7 MyoD ? cells in the presence of BMP4 , but increased differentiation when exposed to Noggin Figure 3c . Culture in proliferation medium does not readily support differentiation of plated satellite cells . Addition of recombinant BMP4 resulted in a higher proportion of cells co-immunos-tained for Pax7 and MyoD Figure 3d . The differentiation index under these culture conditions , however , is already so low that any inhibitory effect of BMP4 on formation of myosin heavy chain MyHC containing myocytes was not significant Figure 3e , quantified in f . Addition of either Noggin or sBMPR-1Af , however , triggered a robust differentiation , as shown by both the reduced proportion of plated cells with Pax7 Figure 3d and the marked increase in myotubes containing MyHC Figure 3e and f . The proportion of satellite cell progeny with the self-renewing Pax7 ? MyoD phenotype was also significantly increased , from effectively zero in control cultures to B0.7 % after exposure to either Noggin or sBMPR-1Af Figure 3d . Finally , we determined the effects of exogenous BMP4 on satellite cells after serum deprivation , which normally promotes myogenin expression , cell cycle exit and fusion into myotubes . However , addition of recombinant BMP4 200 ng ml to differentiation medium led to a significant drop in the proportion of cells containing myogenin Figure 3g , quantified in h and fusing into myotubes Figure 3g , quantified in i . On the other hand , MyoD remained readily detectable in the nuclei of these cells after exposure to BMP4 for 2 days Figure 3g . Importantly , BMP4 caused a 1.46±0.2-fold increase in total cell number , indicating that BMP4 not only inhibits differentiation but also stimulates satellite cell proliferation , despite serum depletion Figure 3j . BMP operates through BMPR-1A to prevent precocious differentiation . To determine whether BMP signalling was transduced through BMPR-1A in activated satellite cells , we used siRNA-mediated knockdown , 25 which reduced the mean total number of satellite cells per myofibre when assayed at T72 Figure 4a , quantified in b . In particular , BMPR-1A knockdown significantly decreased the number of both Pax7 ? MyoD ? cells and Pax7 ? MyoD– self-renewed cells , but not the number of Pax7 MyoD ? differentiating cells , which became the predominant phenotype Figure 4b . The efficient reduction in BMPR-1A levels by siRNA was confirmed by western blot analysis of plated satellite cells , which also revealed decreased Pax7 levels , but an increase in the amount of MyHC Figure 4c . Immunostaining Figure 4d , quantified in e–g confirmed that reducing BMPR-1A led to a reduction in the proportion of Pax7 ? cells Figure 4e , which was accompanied by a significant reduction in Ki67 ? proliferating cells Figure 4d and f . In contrast , there was an increase in the proportion of MyHC ? differentiated cells after BMPR-1A knockdown Figure 4d and g . Blockade of intracellular BMP signalling promotes myogenic differentiation . We next analysed the pSmad1 5 8 signalling cascade.5 The protein kinase inhibitor Dorsomorphin is a specific inhibitor of Smad1 5 8 phosphorylation by BMPRs.26 Dorsomorphin 1–5 mM was not toxic to plated satellite cells , as shown using the Tunel assay data not shown . Exposure of cultured myofibres to Dorsomorphin significantly decreased the mean number of associated Pax7 ? MyoD ? satellite cells , and hence Pax7 MyoD ? differentiating cells became the main phenotype Figure 5a . Dorsomorphin also induced myogenic differentiation in a dose-dependent 0.1–1.0 mM manner in plated satellite cells maintained in proliferation medium Figure 5b . Additionally , we also targeted Smad signalling using siRNA-mediated knockdown of Smad5 or Smad4 , which effectively reduced the levels of the translated protein Figure 5c and d . Co-immunostaining for Ki67 and MyHC revealed that Smad5 or Smad4 knockdown significantly reduced cell proliferation and induced precocious differentiation Figure 5e , quantified in f and g . BMP signalling regulates the ability of MyoD to activate its transcriptional targets . To understand how interference with BMP signalling promotes myogenic differentiation , we investigated Id1 , a downstream target of BMPs6–8 and a negative controller of MyoD and myogenin.9,27 We recently showed that Id1 is highly expressed in proliferating satellite cells , before being downregulated during myogenic differentiation.25 Immunostaining showed that exposure to Dorsomorphin to inhibit Smad1 5 8 phosphorylation reduced Id1 levels in both satellite cells retained in their niche on the myofibre Figure 6a and in plated satellite cells Figure 6b . Muscle creatine kinase CKM is a well-characterised gene and provides a useful tool to quantify both the ability of MyoD to transactivate its target genes , and myogenic differentia-tion.27 Therefore , we measured the activity of a CKM-luciferase construct CKM-LUCpCS2 in response to both exogenous Id1 and perturbation of BMP signalling Figure 6c . As expected , CKM-LUCpCS2 activity was significantly de-creased after transfection with Id1 Figure 6c . Importantly , transfection of a plasmid encoding a constitutively active BMPR-1A caBMPR-1A that phosphorylates Smad1 5 8 in the absence of BMP ligands28 also significantly reduced CKM-LUCpCS2 activity Figure 6c . In contrast , inhibition of Smad1 5 8 phosphorylation with Dorsomorphin significantly increased the activity of CKM-LUCpCS2 , but Id1 was able to completely reverse this Dorsomorphin-mediated increase Figure 6c . Finally , caBMPR-1A also reduced CKM-LUCpCS2 activity back to control levels , despite the presence of Dorsomorphin Figure 6c . Thus , BMP signalling in satellite cells acts to limit the transcriptional activation of genes controlled by MyoD and enhanced during differentiation . Noggin antagonises BMPs to facilitate myogenic differentiation . Noggin is upregulated as satellite cells differentiate Figure 2 . To examine the role of Noggin , we first performed siRNA-mediated knockdown in plated satellite cells , and immunostaining showed that it worked efficiently Figure 7a . Plated satellite cells transfected with Noggin siRNA and co-immunostained for Ki67 and MyHC Figure 7b , quantified c–e had a significantly increased proportion of proliferating Ki67 ? satellite cells Figure 7c . However , the proportion of differentiating MyHC ? cells and the fusion index were both markedly reduced , with only myocytes or small myotubes present Figure 7b and e . Consistent with these observations , western blot analysis revealed a slight decrease in myogenin levels Figure 7f . We also found that the fusion defect induced by Noggin knockdown could be rescued by Dorsomorphin-mediated blockade of intracellular BMP signalling Figure 7g , quantified h , indicating that endogenous Noggin from differentiating cells is required for proper myotube formation , through suppression of BMP signalling . BMP signalling is operative during muscle regeneration in vivo . Finally , we evaluated whether BMP signalling was also operative in satellite cells in regenerating muscle in vivo . Cardiotoxin was used to induce damage in the gastrocnemius muscle of adult mice . After 3 days , the regenerating muscles were removed , cryosectioned and immunostained for pSmad1 5 8 , together with MyoD , to identify satellite cell-derived myoblasts 97.4±2.9 % n ? 50 cells from each of 3 mice of MyoD ? cells contained pSmad1 5 8 Figure 8a . Undamaged areas of the muscle periphery provided the control and no pSmad1 5 8 immunostaining was associated with myofibres in these non-regenerating regions data not shown . Regenerating gastrocnemius muscle was also injected with either 50 ml of 10 mM Dorsomorphin Figure 8b–d or 50 ml of 100 mg ml sBMPR-1Af Figure 8e–g at 1 and 3 days after cardiotoxin-induced injury . The contralateral regenerating muscle served as the control and was injected with 50 ml of vehicle . Regenerating muscles were removed on day 8 and immunostained for MyHC and collagen type 1 Figure 8b and e . Administration of Dorsomorphin resulted in a significant B20 % decrease in the mean perimeter of centrally nucleated regenerating myofibres compared with controls , whereas the reduction was nearer B40 % with sBMPR-1Af Figure 8c and f . A significant B1.5-fold increase in collagen type 1 deposition after either Dorsomorphin or sBMPR-1Af admin-istration was also observed Figure 8d and g . In this study , we investigated the role of BMP signalling in normal adult myogenesis . We found that exogenous BMP4 was able to sustain proliferation in satellite cells and inhibit differentiation . Conversely , blocking interaction of BMP with its receptors , downregulating BMPR-1A or perturbing intra-cellular BMP signal mediation , all induced rapid differentia-tion . Thus , BMP signalling initially serves to allow expansion of the satellite cell pool by stimulating proliferation and preventing precocious myogenic differentiation Figure 9 . The source of BMPs that act on satellite cells in vivo remains to be determined , but myogenic cells can express and secrete BMP4,29,30 with higher levels produced by myoblasts from dystrophic muscle.31 Additionally , muscle damage may also expose satellite cells to BMP4 in serum , 23 and or from cells such as macrophages , as microglia macrophages produce BMPs after CNS damage.32 Although prolonged exposure of myogenic cells to high levels of BMPs can induce expression of various osteogenic genes , 16 we found that satellite cells exposed to BMP4 for shorter periods , likely encountered during muscle repair regeneration in vivo , did not obviously compromise their myogenic identity . Satellite cells respond to BMPs because they express BMPR-1A , which was undetectable on most quiescent satellite cells , but upregulated as cells were activated . An early event in satellite cell activation is induction of MyoD , which can bind to the promoter of BMPR-1A to enhance its expression , and MyoD overexpression leads to BMPR-1A induction.33 Thus upregulation of BMPR-1A is part of the response of satellite cells to serum stimulation , and siRNA-mediated knockdown of BMPR-1A induced premature differ-entiation , showing that BMP signalling operates through BMPR-1A . Consistent with our observations , a dominant-negative BMPR-1A mutant enhanced myogenic differentia-tion in C2 cells maintained in high-serum medium , but a dominant-negative BMPR-1B mutant did not.23 In contrast , we found that a caBMPR-1A28 reduced the activity of a CKM reporter that is normally upregulated during myogenic differentiation . BMPs are known to control the ability of MyoD to transactivate its target genes by Smad-mediated regulation of Id proteins , 6–8 negative regulators of MyoD function and terminal differentiation.9,27 Proliferating satellite cell-derived myoblasts contain both MyoD and Id1 , with Id1 presumably curtailing MyoD function to prevent premature differentiation . Id1 levels are then dramatically reduced as satellite cells undergo differentiation.25 Consistent with these observations , although Id1 and Id3 are undetectable in muscle lysates from uninjured muscle , they are upregulated during muscle regeneration , peaking around day 3.30 In satellite cells , we found that inhibiting BMP signalling reduced Id1 levels , promoted differentiation and increased CKM promoter activity . Delta Notch signalling permits satellite cell expansion and prevents precocious differentiation.34 Notch signalling is required for BMP4 to impede myogenic differentiation in C2 cells inhibitors of g-secretase prevent cleavage of Notch to release the active intracellular domain and can partially reverse the BMP-induced differentiation block.18 The catalytic subunit of the g-secretase complex is presenilin-1 , and we recently showed that presenilin-1 can inhibit satellite cell differentiation through both g-secretase-dependent and g-secretase-independent mechanisms.25 The g-secretase-dependent effects of presenilin-1 on impeding differentiation are likely through controlling Notch signalling . Crucially , however , the g-secretase Notch -independent presenilin-1 mechanism operates by augmenting Pax7 and controlling Id1 levels , 25 and intriguingly , Id1 , Id2 and Id3 are direct transcrip-tional targets of Pax7.29 This g-secretase-independent mechanism is unlikely to work through BMP signalling , however , as there is no difference in pSmad1 5 8 levels between presenilin-1-null or control embryonic fibroblasts transfected with MyoD , even though only the MyoD-expres-sing presenilin-1-null cells readily differentiate in high-serum medium unpublished observations . Furthermore , overex-pression of Wnt3a in C2 cells is capable of overcoming the BMP2-mediated block of differentiation by downregulating Id1.35 Thus g-secretase-independent presenilin-1 signalling and the BMP pathway both seem to separately converge on Ids to regulate satellite cell function . Antagonism of BMP signalling by Noggin is employed during development to protect pre-myogenic cells , and expansion of the Noggin expression domain promotes ectopic myogenesis.11,12 We found that Noggin-mediated interference with BMP signal-ling was also redeployed during adult myogenesis . Noggin was upregulated as satellite cells differentiated , and knocking down Noggin resulted in more cells proliferating , while fewer differ-entiated . As Noggin is a secreted signalling molecule , it may also act in a paracrine manner to reduce BMP signalling in proliferating cells to potentiate and augment timely differentia-tion . Noggin expression in C2 cells is upregulated by exogenous BMP2,36 and administration of Noggin to regenerating muscle reduces both pSmad1 5 8 and Id1 levels.30 In addition , rhabdomyosarcoma cells express myogenic genes including MyoD and myogenin but form myotubes poorly , and have relatively high levels of BMP4 and lower expression of Noggin than primary myoblasts.37 Furthermore , specification of myo-genic cells is unaffected in Noggin-null embryos , but differentia-tion is clearly perturbed , with meagre myotube formation during foetal myogenesis , 38 again suggesting a common role for Noggin in supporting differentiation in both developmental and adult myogenesis . We observed that inhibition of BMP signalling during muscle regeneration resulted in smaller regenerated myofibres . Similarly , Id1 ? Id3 mice also exhibit a muscle regenera-tion defect , with the cross-sectional area of regenerated myofibres being only B50 % of wild type.30 These mice also had fewer proliferating satellite cells during regeneration.30 In conclusion , BMP signalling is part of the programme that regulates routine satellite cell function . BMPs stimulate proliferation and prevent precocious differentiation to allow amplification of satellite cell-derived myoblasts . Noggin is then upregulated as satellite cell progeny differentiate , to antag-onise BMP signalling and facilitate coordinated differentiation Figure 9 .

Representative images from at least three independent experiments are shown . Scale bar equals 30 mm Figure 3 Inhibition of BMP signalling promotes myogenic differentiation in satellite cells . Isolated myofibres associated with satellite cells , or plated satellite cell-derived myoblasts , were cultured in the presence of recombinant BMP4 protein 100 ng ml , recombinant Noggin protein 50 ng ml or sBMPR-1Af 200 ng ml . a EDL myofibres were cultured in plating medium supplemented with BMP4 , Noggin or sBMPR-1Af , then fixed after 24 T24 , 48 T48 or 72 T72 h and immunostained for Pax7 and MyoD . BMP4 reduced the number of Pax7 MyoD ? cells . Both Noggin and sBMPR-1Af reduced the mean total number of cells per myofibre and promoted myogenic differentiation increase of the Pax7 MyoD ? phenotype . b Co-immunostaining isolated myofibres for Pax7 , and myogenin confirmed that BMP4 inhibited myogenic differentiation , whereas Noggin and sBMPR-1Af promoted it , as shown by the increase of satellite cell progeny with the Pax7 myogenin ? phenotype . c Treatment of masseter-derived satellite cells with BMP4 or Noggin for 72 h produced the same result as for EDL cells , that is , BMP4 inhibited , whereas Noggin induced , myogenic differentiation . d–f To examine the effects of these recombinant proteins on the later stages of myogenesis , EDL satellite cells were plated and cultured in the presence of recombinant BMP4 , Noggin or sBMPR-1Af in plating medium for 4 days with the medium changed every other day . d Co-immunostaining for Pax7 and MyoD again showed a dramatic increase in the proportion of cells with the differentiating Pax7 phenotype when exposed to either Noggin or sBMPR-1Af . e , quantified in f Immunostaining for MyHC revealed that exposure to either Noggin or sBMPR-1Af resulted in precocious differentiation and formation of large multi-nucleated myotubes . g–j To better examine the effects of BMP on satellite cell proliferation and myogenic progression , plated satellite cells were also cultured in differentiation medium supplemented with recombinant BMP4 protein 200 ng ml and immunostained for MyoD and myogenin g , quantified in h–j . Exposure to BMP4 significantly reduced the proportion of cells expressing myogenin h and fusing into large myotubes i , but stimulated continued cell proliferation , resulting in a 1.46±0.2-fold increase in total cell number j .

We used siRNA-mediated protein knockdown to explore whether BMP signalling operates through BMPR-1A . a , quantified in b Control Cont si or BMPR-1A BMPR-1Asi siRNA were transfected into satellite cells retained in their niche on isolated EDL myofibers and cultured for B2.5 days before fixation and co-immunostaining for Pax7 and MyoD . BMPR-1A knockdown reduced the mean total number of cells , especially the number of Pax7 ? MyoD ? cells . c–g Control siRNA or BMPR-1A siRNA duplexes were also transfected into plated satellite cell-derived myoblasts . c Immunoblot analysis clearly demonstrated efficient knockdown of BMPR-1A protein levels , which resulted in an upregulation of MyHC , but a downregulation of Pax7 b-tubulin served as a protein loading control . d , quantified in e–g The effects of BMPR-1A knockdown were also examined by immunostaining for Pax7 , Ki67 or MyHC in plated satellite cell-derived myoblasts cultured in proliferation medium for 3 days after transfection . d Representative images of Ki67 and MyHC immunostaining show that BMPR-1A knockdown inhibited cell proliferation and promoted myogenic differentiation . e and f There was a significant decrease in the proportion of cells containing Pax7 or Ki67 proliferating after BMPR-1A siRNA-transfection . g In contrast , there was a significant increase in the proportion of MyHC ? differentiated cells and myotubes . Data are either mean±S.E.M. b or mean±S.D. e–g from at least three independent experiments . Asterisk denotes that data are significantly different from control Po0.05 . Scale bar equals 50 mm Figure 5 Inhibiting intracellular BMP signal mediation promotes myogenic differentiation . To inhibit BMP signaling , we used either Dorsomorphin , an inhibitor of Smad1 5 8 phosphorylation , or siRNA to knockdown the R-Smad , Smad5 , or Co-Smad , Smad4 , levels . a EDL myofibres and their associated satellite cells were cultured with or without 1 mM Dorsomorphin and the plating medium changed daily . Dorsomorphin markedly decreased the mean total number of cells per fibre , particularly the number of cells with the Pax7 ? MyoD ? phenotype . b Satellite cell-derived myoblasts were plated at high cell density 80–90 % confluency and cultured in proliferation medium for 2 days with or without Dorsomorphin . Immunostaining for MyHC showed that Dorsomorphin promoted myogenic differentiation and fusion in a dose-dependent manner . c and d Efficient siRNA-mediated knockdown of Smad5 or Smad4 was confirmed by immunostaining of plated satellite cells 24 h after transfection . e , quantified in f and g Co-immunostaining for MyHC and Ki67 after Smad5 or Smad4 silencing for 3 days in proliferation medium was sufficient to promote cell cycle exit and induce precocious differentiation , characterised by a decreased proportion of cells with Ki67 ? expression and an increase in MyHC ? cells and myotubes . Data are mean±S.E.M. a or mean±S.D. f and g from at least three independent experiments . Asterisk indicates that data are significantly different from control conditions Po0.05 . Scale bar equals 50 mm Figure 6 BMP signalling regulates the MyoD-controlled CKM promoter . Id1 is a target gene of BMP signalling and a negative regulator of MyoD activity . a Exposure to 3 mM Dorsomorphin for 6 h to inhibit BMP signalling resulted in a downregulation of Id1 expression in satellite cells associated with a myofibre . b Similarly , immunostaining of plated satellite cells after exposure to 3 mM Dorsomorphin for 18 h in proliferation medium also resulted in downregulation of Id1 protein . Scale bar equals 20 mm . c To investigate the ability of MyoD to activate its transcriptional targets , plated satellite cell-derived myoblasts were transfected with a CKM muscle creatine kinase Luciferase reporter plasmid CKM-LUCpCS2 , whose activity is regulated by MyoD , together with a Renilla luciferase plasmid pRL driven by a minimal tk promoter , as an internal control . Plated satellites cells were co-transfected with either Cre-expressing control plasmid or Id1-expressing plasmid or constitutively active BMPR-1A caBMPR-1A -expressing plasmid , together with CKM-LUCpCS2 . After transfection , the cells were cultured in proliferation medium with or without 5 mM Dorsomorphin for 24 h before reporter assay . Id1 or caBMPR-1A reduced CKM-LUCpCS2 activity . In contrast , inhibition of BMP signalling with Dorsomorphin had the opposite effect , and increased CKM-LUCpCS2 activity . Both Id1 and caBMPR-1A were able to reverse this increase in CKM-LUCpCS2 activity produced by exposure to Dorsomophin . Data are represented as mean±S.D. from at least three independent experiments . Asterisk denotes that data are significantly different from control conditions , whereas a cross indicates that data are different from the level of CKM-LUCpCS2 activity in the presence of Dorsomorphin Po0.05 , using Student’s t-test Figure 7 Reducing Noggin levels enhances satellite cell proliferation but inhibits differentiation . To further understand the role of Noggin in myogenic progression , we used siRNA-mediated knockdown of Noggin protein . a Efficient Noggin knockdown in plated satellite cell-derived myoblasts was confirmed by immunostaining for Noggin 3 days after siRNA Noggin si transfection . b , quantified in c–e The effects of Noggin knockdown were analysed by co-immunostaining for MyHC and Ki67 , which revealed an increase in myoblast proliferation , but a reduction in differentiation and fusion into large myotubes . f Western blotting also showed that Noggin siRNA reduced myogenin levels in plated satellite cells . g , quantified in h The effect of Dorsomorphin 1 mM treatment to inhibit BMP signalling on Noggin siRNA-transfected cells was analysed by immunostaining for MyHC . Dorsomorphin reversed the fusion defect induced by Noggin knockdown . Mean±S.D. from at least three independent experiments is shown . Asterisk indicates that data are significantly different from control Po0.05 using paired one-tail t-test . Scale bar equals 30 mm Figure 8 BMP signalling operates during normal muscle regeneration in vivo . Regeneration was induced in mouse gastrocnemius muscles by injection of cardiotoxin . a Satellite cell-derived myoblasts , identified by MyoD expression , also expressed pSmad1 5 8 arrowheads in regenerating muscle on day 3 of regeneration . b–g To examine the effects of blockade of BMP signalling , 50 ml of 10 mM Dorsomorphin DMSO in saline or 50 ml of 100 mg ml sBMPR-1Af were intramuscularly injected into the right gastrocnemius , 1 and 3 days after cardiotoxin injection . Regenerating left gastrocnemius served as a control and received vehicle alone DMSO saline for Dorsomorphin or BSA solution for sBMPR-1Af . Muscle regeneration was assayed by immunostaining cryosections for MyHC and collagen type 1 . b , c , e and f Treatment with either Dorsomorphin or sBMPR-1Af resulted in a significant decrease in the mean perimeter of centrally nucleated regenerating myofibres , compared with controls 100 regenerating fibres in the regenerating area of each animal were measured , and the mean size after exposure to Dorsomorphin or sBMPR-1Af expressed as the proportional change compared with the mean size of control regenerating myofibres . b , d , e and g Immunostaining for collagen type 1 was used to measure the degree of endomysial fibrosis , and a significant increase in the fibrotic index was observed in muscles exposed to either Dorsomorphin or sBMPR-1Af , compared with controls the area of collagen type 1 expression in the regenerating area was measured in 1–3 sections for each animal , using ImageJ and changes with exposure to Dorsomorphin or sBMPR-1Af expressed as fold-difference compared with control . Six mice were used for each condition . Data are mean±S.E.M. , where an asterisk denotes a significant difference from control Po0.05 . Scale bars equal 100 mm Figure 9 Role of BMP signalling during myogenic progression in satellite cells . During muscle repair and regeneration , quiescent Pax7 ? satellite cells are activated to co-express Pax7 and MyoD . Satellite cell-derived myoblasts proliferate extensively before many cells then downregulate Pax7 and differentiate to either repair damaged muscle fibres or fuse together to generate new myofibres . Other satellite cells maintain Pax7 expression but lose MyoD , and self-renew to maintain a viable stem cell compartment . Normal BMP signalling through BMPR-1A and Smad1 5 8 phosphorylation is required during muscle repair regeneration to allow the satellite cell-derived myoblast population to expand , by preventing precocious differentiation . BMP signalling operates through controlling Id levels , a negative regulator of MyoD and myogenic differentiation . As satellite cell progeny differentiate , Noggin is upregulated to antagonise the BMP signal , so facilitating the myogenic differentiation programme 
21040253	Miyagi 980-8574 , Japan Gunma 371-8511 , Japan Introduction The intestinal immune system of mammals is respon-sible for maintaining immunologic tolerance to food antigens and commensal organisms as well as for the recognition of harmful pathogens and their elimina-tion by humoral or cellular immune responses Xavier Podolsky 2007 Artis 2008 Garrett et al. 2010 . Deregulation of these dual functions results in uncon-trolled inflammatory disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease IBD in humans Xavier Podolsky 2007 Garrett et al. 2010 . Mononuclear phagocytes such as dendritic cells DCs and macrophages are thought to be key regulators of the intestinal immune system Iwasaki 2007 Coombes Powrie 2008 Platt Mowat 2008 . These cells are widely distributed in intestinal lymphoid organs including Peyer’s patches and mesenteric lymph nodes , but they also reside in the connective tissue underlying the intestinal epithelium , the lamina propria LP Iwasaki 2007 Predominant expression of SIRPa on R2–R4 described previously Uematsu et al. 2008 , the R1 and R2 subsets are thought to be DCs that also express major histocompatibility complex MHC class II as well as CD80 , CD86 and CD40 Fig. 1B . In addition , R1-LP cells express DEC-205 and CD103 at high levels , whereas subpopulations of R2-LP cells express CD103 or F4 ? 80 Fig. 1B . R3-LP cells are thought to be F4 ? 80+ MHC class II+ DEC-205 macrophages , whereas R4-LP cells are F4 ? 80+ MHC class II eosinophils Fig. 1B Denning et al. 2007 Uematsu et al. 2008 . Among these CD11c+ LP subsets , we found that the surface expression of SIRPa was predominant in R2 - , R3 - , and R4-LP cells , being minimal or low in R1-LP cells Fig. 1B . We next investigated the frequencies of these CD11c+ subsets in the LP of SIRPa mutant MT mice , which express a MT version of SIRPa lacking most of the cytoplasmic region Tomizawa et al. 2007 . The MT protein expressed in the transgenic animals does not undergo tyrosine phosphorylation nor does it form a complex with SHP-1 or SHP-2 Tomizawa et al. 2007 . Given the importance of its cytoplasmic region for signaling by SIRPa , the func-tion of this protein is thought to be eliminated in the MT mice . Furthermore , the cellular abundance of the MT protein is markedly reduced compared with that of the full-length protein in wild-type WT cells Tomizawa et al. 2007 . Indeed , the abundance of SIRPa was substantially reduced in R2 - , R3-and R4-LP cells of the small intestine in SIRPa MT mice compared with that apparent for the corresponding WT cells Fig. 1B . We also found that the frequency of the R3-LP cell subset was significantly decreased in the MT animals compared with that in WT mice , whereas the percentage of each of the other three CD11c+ LP subsets did not differ between the two genotypes Fig. 1C . Examination of the expression of surface markers MHC class II , DEC-205 , CD80 , CD86 , CD40 , CD103 , F4 ? 80 on each CD11c+ LP subset in SIRPa MT mice revealed no marked differ-ences compared with WT mice Fig. 1B . Moreover , the frequencies of B220+ B cells , CD4+ or CD8+ T cells and cd T-cell receptor TCR + T cells , the latter of which are also thought to produce IFN-c and IL-17 Nanno et al. 2008 Sutton et al. 2009 Martin et al. 2009 , as well as that of NK1.1+ natural killer NK cells or NKT cells in the LP did not differ between SIRPa MT and WT animals Fig. 1D . R2-LP cells CD11chi CD11bhi LPDCs , which express SIRPa at a high level , are thought to pro-mote the differentiation of antigen-specific Th17 cells and Th1 cells Denning et al. 2007 Uematsu et al . 2008 . The frequency of IL-17 or IFN-c expression in CD4+ T cells of the LP in mice maintained under germfree conditions is greatly reduced compared with that apparent in animals maintained under specific pathogen-free SPF conditions Atarashi et al. 2008 Niess et al. 2008 . The frequency of such ‘naturally occurring’ IL-17-expressing CD4+ T cells in the LP of the small intestine or colon of SIRPa MT mice maintained under SPF conditions was slightly reduced compared with that in WT mice , although this differ-ence was not statistically significant Fig. 2A . In addi-tion , the frequency of CD4+ T cells that produce IFN-c in the LP of either the small intestine or colo-nic mucosa was similar for SIRPa MT and WT mice Fig. 2A . R2-LPDCs also induce IgA class-switch recombination in B cells Uematsu et al. 2008 . How-ever , the level of IgA in serum or stool samples did not differ between WT and SIRPa MT mice Fig. 2B . CD11b+ F4 ? 80+ macrophages in the LP , which correspond to R3-LP cells , are effective induc-ers of Treg cells Denning et al. 2007 . However , the frequency of CD4+ CD25+ Treg cells in the LP of the small intestine did not differ between WT and SIRPa MT mice Fig. 2C . These results thus sug-gested that SIRPa plays a minimal or minor role at most in the regulation of steady-state homeostasis of mucosal immunity in the intestine . Impaired production of IL-17 and IFN-c by flagellin-stimulated LP cells from SIRPa MT mice Under inflammatory conditions , the development of Th17 cells is thought to require IL-6 as well as TGF-b , whereas that of Th1 cells requires IL-12 Littman Rudensky 2010 . These cytokines are thought to be produced , at least in part , by myeloid cells such as DCs or macrophages in response to stimulation with TLR ligands . We therefore next investigated whether SIRPa of CD11c+ cells is important for the induction of Th17 or Th1 cells in the LP . To this end , we set up an in vitro assay system to examine the ability of LP cells to induce Th17 or Th1 cell differentiation in the presence of TLR ligands by modification of a method previously applied to splenocytes Aggarwal et al. 2003 . CD11chi CD11bhi LPDCs in the small intestine promote the differentiation of Th17 cells and Th1 cells in a manner dependent on TLR5 Uematsu et al. 2008 . Indeed , culture of isolated LP cells from the small intestine of WT mice with flagel-lin , a ligand for TLR5 Hayashi et al. 2001 , pro-moted the production of IL-17 as well as IFN-c Fig. 3A . Moreover , removal of CD11c+ cells from A B Figure 2 Frequency of IL-17-or interferon IFN -c-express-ing CD4+ T cells and of Treg cells in the lamina propria LP as well as the level of IgA production in the intestine of WT and signal regulatory protein a SIRPa mutant MT mice . A LP cells from the small intestine or colon of WT or SIRPa MT mice at 8–12 weeks of age were stimulated with PMA 100 ng ? mL and ionomycin 1 lg ? mL for 4 h in the presence of GolgiPlug . The cells were then incubated with a biotin-conjugated mAb to CD4 , stained with APC-conjugated streptavidin , fixed , permeabilized and stained with a phycoery-thrin PE -conjugated mAb to IL-17A and an fluorescein iso-thiocyanate-conjugated mAb to IFN-c . The intracellular expression of IL-17 or IFN-c in CD4+ cells was then analyzed by three-color flow cytometry left panels the relative num-bers of CD4+ cells that express IL-17 or IFN-c are indicated as a percentage of all CD4+ LP cells on each plot . The per-centages of CD4+ cells that express IL-17 or IFN-c among all CD4+ LP cells were also determined as means ± SE of values from three small intestine or four colon independent exper-iments right panels .

Data are means ± SE for at least six mice per group and are representative of three independent experiments .

The percentage of CD4+ CD25+ Treg cells among all CD4+ PI cells was determined by flow cytometry . Data are means ± SE of values from three independent experiments . the LP cell population resulted in a marked decrease in the production of IL-17 and IFN-c induced by fla-gellin Fig. 3A , indicating that CD11c+ cells are indeed important for the flagellin-stimulated produc - A B C Figure 3 Reduced production of IL-17 , interferon IFN -c and IL-6 by flagellin-stimulated lamina propria LP cells from signal regulatory protein a SIRPa mutant MT mice . A LP cells or LP cells that had been depleted of CD11c+ cells from the small intestine of WT mice at 8–12 weeks of age were cultured with or without flagellin 1 lg ? mL for 72 h , after which the concentrations of IL-17 left panel or IFN-c right panel in the culture supernatants were determined by ELISA .

Depletion of CD4+ T cells from the LP cell prepara-tion also resulted in a marked decrease in the flagel-lin-stimulated production of IL-17 and IFN-c data not shown , suggesting that flagellin stimulation of CD11c+ cells indeed promotes the function of CD4+ T cells that produce IL-17 Th17 or IFN-c Th1 in this system . We found that the flagellin-stimulated production of IL-17 or IFN-c by LP cells of SIRPa MT mice was markedly decreased compared with that apparent with cells from WT mice Fig. 3B . IL-6 is important for the differentiation and expan-sion of Th17 cells Littman Rudensky 2010 . Indeed , culture of LP cells from WT mice with fla-gellin markedly increased the production of IL-6 Fig. 3C . Depletion of CD11c+ cells from the LP cell population resulted in a substantial reduction in the level of IL-6 production induced by flagellin Fig. 3C , indicating that CD11c+ cells are indeed important for the flagellin-stimulated production of IL-6 from LP cells . The production of IL-6 by LP cells from SIRPa MT mice incubated with or even without flagellin was markedly reduced compared with that apparent with LP cells from WT mice Fig. 3C . Although IL-12 is thought to be important for the generation of Th1 cells producing IFN-c , we failed to detect the p40 subunit of IL-12 in the cul-ture supernatants of flagellin-stimulated LP cells from WT or SIRPa MT mice data not shown . Resistance of SIRPa MT mice to colitis induced by IL-10 deficiency We next examined the role of SIRPa in the regula-tion of intestinal inflammation . IL-10-deficient IL-10 KO mice manifest spontaneous colitis that resembles the colitis in human IBD such as Crohn’s disease or ulcerative colitis Xavier Podolsky 2007 Kuhn¨ et al. 1993 Berg et al. 1996 . We crossed SIRPa MT mice with IL-10 KO mice on the C57BL ? 6 back-ground Kuhn ¨ et al. 1993 , and then examined the susceptibility of SIRPa MT mice to spontaneous colitis associated with IL-10 deficiency . Both IL-10 KO mice and SIRPa MT ? IL-10 KO mice were maintained under conventional conditions . We first monitored disease activity for colitis , which was scored on the basis of stool consistency , blood in the stool and anorectal prolapse , in IL-10 KO mice and SIRPa MT ? IL-10 KO mice at 10 and 16 weeks of age . The disease activity in SIRPa MT ? IL-10 KO mice at either 10 or 16 weeks of age was markedly reduced compared with that apparent in IL-10 KO mice Fig. 4A . The colon of IL-10 KO mice at 10 weeks of age showed signs of severe colitis , such as a greatly increased thickness of the bowel wall and reduced bowel length , whereas such signs were not observed with SIRPa MT ? IL-10 KO mice Fig. 4B . Moreover , microscopic examination revealed that IL - A B C D E Figure 4 Resistance of signal regulatory protein a SIRPa mutant MT mice to colitis induced by IL-10 deficiency .

E Survival rates of IL-10 KO mice n 16 and SIRPa LS ? IL-10 KO mice n 14 . 10 KO mice at 10 weeks of age typically manifested an increased thickness of the colonic mucosa as well as pronounced inflammatory infiltrates , crypt abscesses and epithelial hyperplasia Fig. 4C . In contrast , the colon of SIRPa MT ? IL-10 KO mice showed mini-mal inflammatory changes compared with IL-10 KO mice Fig. 4C . Consequently , the histological scores of SIRPa MT ? IL-10 KO mice were lower than those of IL-10 KO mice Fig. 4D . Finally , the sur-vival rate of SIRPa MT ? IL-10 KO mice was higher than that of IL-10 KO mice Fig. 4E . Collectively , these results suggested that SIRPa MT mice are resis-tant to the development of colitis induced by IL-10 deficiency . Both Th1 cells and Th17 cells are implicated in the development of spontaneous colitis associated with IL-10 deficiency Berg et al. 1996 Shiraki et al. 2004 Yen et al. 2006 Montufar-Solis et al. 2008 . The frequency of CD4+ cells producing IFN-c was significantly decreased in the colonic LP of SIRPa MT ? IL-10 KO mice compared with that in IL-10 KO mice Fig. 5 . The frequency of CD4+ cells pro-ducing IL-17 was also decreased in the colonic LP of SIRPa MT ? IL-10 KO mice compared with that in IL-10 KO mice , although this difference was not sta-tistically significant Fig. 5 . Discussion Signal regulatory protein a was previously shown to be expressed predominantly in DCs , macrophages and neutrophils Matozaki et al. 2009a Lahoud et al . 2006 . We have now found that SIRPa is expressed in CD11chi CD11bhi DCs R2 subset as well as in CD11cint CD11bint macrophages R3 and CD11cint CD11bhi eosinophils R4 . However , the expression level of SIRPa was low or minimal in CD11chi CD11blo DCs R1 . The level of SIRPa expression in the spleen was previously shown to differ among CD11chi cDC subtypes , being greater in CD8 cDCs than in CD8+ cDCs Lahoud et al. 2006 . Further-more , the number of CD8 cDCs is selectively reduced in the spleen of SIRPa MT mice Matozaki et al. 2009a , suggesting that SIRPa is important for the homeostatic regulation of CD8 cDCs in the spleen . In contrast , the frequency of R2-LPDCs , which express SIRPa at a high level , did not differ between WT and SIRPa MT mice . Thus , in contrast to the situation in the spleen , SIRPa does not appear to be important for the homeostatic regulation of the CD11chi DC population in the LP of the intestine . R2-LPDCs are thought to promote the differentia-tion of antigen-specific Th17 cells and Th1 cells as well as IgA class-switch recombination in B cells Denning et al. 2007 Uematsu et al. 2008 . The high level of SIRPa expression in R2-LPDCs suggested that SIRPa might be important specifically for the regulation of these functions of R2-LPDCs . How-ever , the frequency of IL-17-or IFN-c-expressing CD4+ T cells in the LP of either the small intestine or colon did not differ significantly between SIRPa MT and WT mice . Moreover , the level of IgA in serum or stool samples did not differ between animals of the two genotypes . CD11b+ F4 ? 80+ macrophages , which were also shown to express SIRPa at a high level , are thought to be important for the induction of Treg cells Denning et al. 2007 . However , whereas the frequency of R3-LP macrophages in the small intestine was slightly but significantly decreased in SIRPa MT mice , the frequency of CD4+ CD25+ Treg cells in the LP did not differ between SIRPa MT and WT mice . Together , these results suggest that SIRPa is largely dispensable for the steady-state homeostasis of LPDCs and mucosal immunity in the intestine . In contrast , the flagellin-stimulated production of IL-17 or IFN-c in cultures of LP cells from SIRPa MT mice was markedly reduced compared with that apparent with cells from WT mice . Depletion of CD11c+ cells from LP cells of WT mice largely abol-ished the flagellin-stimulated production of both IL-17 and IFN-c . Given that R2-LP cells are thought to promote the differentiation of antigen-specific Th17 cells and Th1 cells Denning et al. 2007 Uematsu et al. 2008 and that SIRPa is prominently expressed in CD11chi R2-LPDCs , these results together sug-gest that SIRPa on CD11c+ cells such as R2-LPDCs is important for the flagellin-stimulated production of IL-17 and IFN-c in cultures of LP cells . IL-6 is also implicated in the generation of Th17 cells Littman Rudensky 2010 . Depletion of CD11c+ cells from LP cells of WT mice resulted in a marked reduction in flagellin-induced IL-6 production , indicating that CD11c+ LP cells are important for the IL-6 produc-tion . Indeed , CD11chi R2-LPDCs were previously shown to produce IL-6 in response to flagellin stimu-lation Uematsu et al. 2008 . We also showed that the flagellin-induced production of IL-6 by cultures of LP cells from SIRPa MT mice was greatly reduced compared with that apparent with cells from WT ani-mals . The large reduction in the release of IL-17 into the culture supernatants of flagellin-stimulated LP cells from SIRPa MT mice is therefore likely attrib-utable , at least in part , to a reduced production of IL-6 by CD11c+ cells . Our data thus suggest that SIRPa is important for the TLR5-dependent produc-tion of IL-6 by CD11c+ LP cells . The molecular mechanism by which SIRPa positively regulates the TLR5-mediated production of IL-6 by CD11c+ LP cells remains unknown , however . Moreover , SIRPa was previously shown to negatively regulate the TLR4-or TLR3-mediated production of proinflam-matory cytokines such as IL-6 or tumor necrosis factor-a in macrophages Kong et al. 2007 Miyake et al. 2008 . Thus , it remains unclear why SIRPa negatively regulates macrophages but it does posi-tively CD11c+ LP cells . Such discrepancy might be attributable to the difference of cell specificity between macrophages and CD11c+ LP cells . In addi-tion , given that SHP-1 is a negative regulator of the signaling in hematopoietic cells Neel et al. 2003 , negative regulation by SIRPa of the TLR4-or TLR3-induced production of proinflammatory cyto-kines in macrophages is mediated by SHP-1 that pref - erentially binds to tyrosine-phosphorylated SIRPa . By contrast , TLRs activate conserved inflammatory signaling pathways that culminate in the activation of nuclear factor jB NF-jB and AP-1 Kawai Akira 2006 . Activation of AP-1 by TLR signaling is medi-ated in large part by mitogen-activated protein kinases MAPKs including ERK , p38 and JNK Kawai Akira 2006 . SHP-2 , a protein tyrosine phosphatase that binds to the ITIMs in the cytoplasmic region of SIRPa , is implicated in the activation of MAPKs or NF-jB in response to growth factors or cytokines Matozaki et al. 2009b You et al. 2001 . Thus , it is possible that SHP-2 that preferentially binds to SIRPa in CD11c+ LP cells positively regulates the TLR5-dependent production of IL-6 . We found that SIRPa MT mice are resistant to the development of colitis induced by IL-10 defi-ciency . Moreover , the frequency of CD4+ cells pro-ducing IFN-c or IL-17 was decreased in the colonic LP of SIRPa MT ? IL-10 KO mice compared with that in IL-10 KO mice . SIRPa is thus essential for the development of colitis induced by IL-10 defi-ciency . SIRPa MT mice were previously shown to be resistant to the development of Th17 cell-or Th1 cell-related autoimmune diseases such as experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis , collagen-induced arthritis and skin contact hypersensitivity Matozaki et al. 2009a Tomizawa et al. 2007 . Both Th1 cells and Th17 cells are thought to be important for the development of spontaneous colitis associated with IL-10 deficiency Berg et al. 1996 Yen et al. 2006 Montufar-Solis et al. 2008 . Together , these observa-tions suggest that SIRPa contributes to the develop-ment of various inflammatory autoimmune diseases . The severity of spontaneous colitis in IL-10 KO mice is greatly attenuated when the animals are maintained under SPF or germfree conditions , suggesting that commensal bacteria are important for the develop-ment of colitis in these mice Kuhn ¨ et al. 1993 Sellon et al. 1998 . Given that flagellin is a major component of the flagellae of commensal and pathogenic bacteria Hayashi et al. 2001 , our present results suggest that the resistance of SIRPa MT mice to the development of colitis induced by IL-10 deficiency is attributable , at least in part , to a defect in the flagellin-stimulated production of IL-17 or IFN-c by LP cells . It has recently been shown that mice deficient of CD47 , a ligand for SIRPa , also manifest resistance to trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid-induced colitis Fortin et al. 2009 . In addition , CD47 in SIRPa+ CD103 DCs of the LP is suggested to be important for effi-cient trafficking of these cells to mesenteric lymph nodes as well as for the development of Th17 cells and intestinal inflammation . Taken together with our study , cis-interaction of CD47 and SIRPa in LPDCs might be important for the TLR5-stimulated produc-tion of IL-17 , IFN-c or IL-6 by LP cells as well as development of colitis . Moreover , trans-interaction of SIRPa on DCs with CD47 on CD4+ T cells in the LP might be also important for the Th17 or Th1 cell development in the intestine as proposed previously Seiffert et al. 2001 Tomizawa et al. 2007 . Thus , the susceptibility of SIRPa function to regulation by ligands such as antibodies suggests that this protein is a potential therapeutic target in IBD .

Signal regulatory protein a MT mice were generated as described previously Tomizawa et al. 2007 and were backcrossed onto the C57BL ? 6 background for 10 generations . IL-10 KO mice on the C57BL ? 6 background B6.129P2-Il10tm1Cgn ? J were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory Bar Harbor , ME , USA . SIRPa LS ? IL-10 KO mice were gener-ated by crossing IL-10 KO mice with SIRPa MT mice . All animals were maintained at the Institute of Experimental Ani-mal Research of Gunma University SIRPa MT mice and their WT littermates were maintained under SPF conditions , whereas IL-10 KO and SIRPa MT ? IL-10 KO mice were kept under conventional conditions . Animals were handled in accordance with the guidelines of the Animal Care and Exper-imentation Committee of Gunma University . Lamina propria cells were prepared from the small intestine or colon as described Tezuka et al. 2007 with minor modifica-tions . In brief , the small intestine and colon were excised from adult mice and freed of mesentery for the small intestine , Peyer’s patches were also removed . The small intestine or colon was then opened longitudinally and washed with phosphate-buffered saline PBS to remove fecal content . The tissue was cut into pieces 1.5–2 cm in length , transferred to a 50-mL conical tube or 500-mL plastic bottle , and shaken for three or four 15-min periods at room temperature in PBS containing 5 mM EDTA . The muscle layer was removed from the remaining tissue , which was then washed with PBS , minced and incubated for 20 min at 37 °C in Hank’s balanced salt solution containing collagenase type IV Sigma-Aldrich at 1 mg ? mL . The resulting cell suspension was passed through a 70-lm cell strainer BD Biosciences , and the cells were col-lected by centrifugation at 340 g . The cells were then sus-pended in PBS containing 40 % v ? v Percoll GE Healthcare , Piscataway , NL , USA , gently overlaid on 75 % Percoll in PBS and centrifuged at 700 g for 20 min at room temperature . Cells at the interface of the two layers were collected , washed and studied as LP cells . Flow cytometric analysis of LP cells For examination of the expression of SIRPa in and the phe-notype of CD11c+ LP cells , LP cells prepared from the small intestine were first incubated with a mAb to mouse CD16 ? 32 to prevent nonspecific binding of labeled mAbs to Fcc recep-tors . The cells were then stained with biotin-conjugated mAbs to SIRPa , MHC class II , DEC-205 , CD80 , CD86 , CD40 or CD103 . They were washed , incubated with an FITC-conju-gated mAb to CD11b , PE-conjugated streptavidin or a PE-conjugated mAb to F4 ? 80 and an APC-conjugated mAb to CD11c , and then washed again before suspension in the pres-ence of PI to identify dead cells . For the determination of the frequency of B cells , CD4+ T cells , CD8+ T cells , cdTCR+ T cells or NK cells or NKT cells , LP cells prepared from the small intestine were incubated with an APC-Cy7-conjugated mAb to B220 and PI , or they were incubated first with an FITC-conjugated mAb to CD3 and biotin-conjugated mAbs to CD4 , CD8 , cdTCR or NK1.1 and then with APC-conjugated streptavidin and PI . For the analysis of Treg cells , LP cells were incubated with a biotin-conjugated mAb to mouse CD25 , washed , and then incubated with an FITC-conjugated mAb to mouse CD4 , PE-conjugated streptavidin and PI . Cells were analyzed by flow cytometry with the use of a FACSCan-toII or FACSAriaII instrument BD Biosciences and with FLOWJO software Tree Star , Ashland , OR , USA . Intracellular cytokine staining The intracellular expression of IL-17 or IFN-c in CD4+ T cells was analyzed as described previously Atarashi et al. 2008 . In brief , LP cells isolated from the small intestine or colon were cultured for 4 h at 37 °C with phorbol myristate acetate PMA 100 ng ? mL , ionomycin 1 lg ? mL Sigma-Aldrich and BD GolgiPlug BD Biosciences in complete medium . The cells were then stained first with a biotin-con-jugated mAb to CD4 and then with APC-conjugated strepta-vidin , fixed with 4 % paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with the use of a BD Cytofix ? Cytoperm kit BD Bioscien-ces . Intracellular cytokine staining was carried out with a PE-conjugated mAb to IL-17A and an FITC-conjugated mAb to IFN-c . The cells were then subjected to flow cytometry with a FACSCantoII instrument , and the data were analyzed with FLOWJO software . Measurement of IgA The concentration of IgA in serum or stool samples was mea-sured as described previously Tezuka et al. 2007 . Serum was diluted 1 10 000 for the assay . Fecal pellets 100 mg from the cecum were dispersed by mixing in 0.5 mL of PBS con-taining 2 mM benzamidine Sigma-Aldrich and phenylmethyl-sulfonyl fluoride 2 lg ? mL , after which insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 17 500 g for 10 min at 4 °C , and the resulting supernatant was collected and diluted 1 10 or 1 100 . The concentration of IgA in serum or fecal extract was then determined with the use of an enzyme-linked immuno-sorbent assay ELISA Bethyl Laboratories , Montgomery , TX , USA . Analysis of flagellin-stimulated cytokine production by LP cells was carried out with a modified version of the method described previously for splenocytes Aggarwal et al. 2003 . In brief , LP cells 4 · 105 prepared from the small intestine were cultured with or without flagellin 1 lg ? mL for 72 h at 37 °C in 96-well round-bottomed microplates . In some experiments , LP cells that had been depleted of CD11c+ cells with the use of anti-CD11c microbeads and magnetic-acti-vated cell sorting were studied . The culture supernatants were collected and assayed for IFN-c , IL-17 and IL-6 with the use of ELISA kits R D Systems , Minneapolis , MN , USA . Clinical and histological assessment of colitis For assessment of colitis , SIRPa LS ? IL-10 KO mice or IL-10 KO mice were maintained under conventional conditions , weighed weekly and monitored for the appearance of diarrhea , blood in the stool and anorectal prolapse . Disease activity was scored as previously described Siegmund et al. 2004 with minor modifications . Stool consistency was scored as follows 0 normal , 2 loose stools , 4 liquid stools . Blood in the stool was scored as follows 0 no blood as revealed with the use of the guaiac occult blood test Occult Blood Slide II Shionogi , Osaka , Japan , 2 positive guaiac occult blood test , 4 gross bleeding . Development of anorectal prolapse was scored as follows 0 no prolapse , 2 prolapse evident only during defecation , 4 prolapse evident at all times . The total score for diarrhea , blood in the stool and prolapse , ranging from 0 normal to 12 severe , was determined . For the scor-ing of colonic inflammation by histological examination , the distal colon was excised and immediately fixed with 4 % para-formaldehyde in 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer pH 7.4 . Par-affin-embedded sections 4 lm were stained with Mayer’s hematoxylin and eosin , and a combined score for the inflam-matory cell infiltration , tissue damage and crypt structure was determined in a blinded manner as described previously Sieg-mund et al. 2004 . Inflammatory cell infiltration was scored as follows 0 presence of occasional inflammatory cells in the LP , 1 presence of an increased number of inflammatory cells in the LP , 2 confluence of inflammatory cells extending into the submucosa , 3 transmural extension of the infiltrate . For tissue damage 0 no mucosal damage , 1 lymphoepithelial lesions , 2 surface mucosal erosion , 3 extensive mucosal damage and extension into deeper structures of the colonic wall . For crypt structure 0 normal structure , 1 occasional hyperplasia without depletion of goblet cells , 2 hyperplasia with depletion of goblet cells , 3 distortion of crypts and presence of crypt abscesses . The total score thus ranged from 0 no change to 9 severe . Statistical analysis Disease activity and histological scores were compared between mouse genotypes with the Mann–Whitney U-test . Other data are presented as means ± SE and were analyzed by Student’s t-test for comparisons between two groups or conditions or by one-way analysis of variance ANOVA and the Bonferroni post hoc test for comparisons among three or more groups or con-ditions . A P-value of 0.05 was considered statistically signifi-cant . All statistical analysis was carried out with the use of PRISM for MACINTOSH GRAPHPAD Software , San Diego , CA , USA .

21113145	www.nature.com cdd Mitochondrial dysfunction has long been implicated in the pathogenesis of Parkinson’s disease PD . Mitochondrial toxins targeting complex I of the electron transport chain can induce acute parkinsonism in humans and are being used to model PD in animals . More recently , several PD-associated genes have been shown to influence mitochondrial function , morphology , dynamics and turnover reviewed in Winklhofer and Haass1 and Schapira2 . In addition to mitochondrial dysfunction , several lines of evidence indicate that endoplas-mic reticulum ER stress may contribute to the pathogenesis of PD reviewed in Wang and Takahashi3 and Lindholm et al.4 . First , toxins such as MPTP , 6-OHDA or rotenone , used to induce parkinsonism in animal models , have been shown to cause ER stress.5–7 Second , ER stress accounts for at least some aspects of a-synuclein toxicity . a-Synuclein has been shown to block ER to Golgi vesicular trafficking in different model systems , 8 and overexpression of a-synuclein can induce ER stress.8,9 Finally , ER stress has been documented in dopaminergic neurons of the parkinsonian brain , exemplified by increased levels of phospho-PERK , phospho-eIF2a and caspase-4.10,11 The link between PD and ER dysfunction was recently reinforced by the observation that the E3 ubiquitin ligase parkin can protect cells from ER stress-induced cell death induced by the overexpression of Pael-R , a putative parkin substrate prone to misfolding within the secretory pathway.12,13 Mutations in the parkin gene were identified as a cause of early onset PD in Japanese families.14 Since then , more than 100 mutations have been described in patients of diverse ethnic backgrounds , accounting for the majority of autosomal recessive parkinsonism . ER stress originates from the accumulation of unfolded secretory proteins , perturbations in calcium homeostasis or redox status , alterations in glycosylation or energy depriva-tion . The ER has evolved sophisticated stress response signaling pathways collectively called the unfolded protein response UPR , destined to increase the ER folding capacity , to reduce the folding load and to restore ER homeostasis reviewed in Ron and Walter15 . Conversely , when ER stress conditions are severe or persistent , apoptotic cell death is induced reviewed in Kim et al.16 . Recent research revealed that the ER physically and functionally interacts with mitochondria to influence key aspects of cellular physiology and viability reviewed in Pizzo and Pozzan17 . Interactions between these organelles allow the exchange of metabolites and are implicated in the regulation of calcium signaling and cell death pathways . Our study shows that parkin expression is increased on ER stress and mitochondrial stress through the PERK ATF4 branch of the UPR . Increased expression of parkin prevents ER stress-induced mitochondrial damage and cell death , providing evidence for a functional link between parkin , ER stress and mitochondrial integrity . Results Mitochondrial membrane dissipation causes ER stress and leads to transcriptional upregulation of parkin . The protonophore CCCP is being used to induce mitochondrial damage in various model systems . CCCP renders the mitochondrial inner membrane permeable for protons and causes dissipation of the proton gradient . We previously observed that the complex I inhibitor rotenone induces an upregulation of parkin mRNA and protein levels.18 CCCP has recently been shown to cause the translocation of parkin to damaged mitochondria , which are then removed by autophagy.19 We , therefore addressed the question whether CCCP might also have an impact on the transcriptional regulation of parkin . Parkin transcripts were significantly increased both in CCCP-treated SH-SY5Y cells and primary mouse cortical neurons Figures 1a and b . To get insight into the underlying mechanism , we screened the parkin promoter for possible binding sites BSs of stress-regulated transcription factors by using TFSEARCH http www.cbrc.jp research db TFSEARCH.html .20 We discovered a putative CREB ATF site in the parkin promoter located from 169 to 161bp relative to the transcriptional start site TSS . A further in-depth analysis identified this site as a possible binding sequence for ATF4 Figures 1c and 3a . The CREB ATF site within the parkin promoter is conserved among species Figure 1c , supporting the notion that this site might be functionally relevant . An additional ATF4-binding site is located downstream of the TSS within the first intron of human , bovine and rodent parkin Figure 1c . ATF4 is a transcription factor , which is activated under ER stress . Some toxins used to model PD have been associated with ER stress , therefore we analyzed whether mitochondrial membrane dissipation induced by CCCP can cause ER stress . Regulation of gene expression in response to ER stress is mediated by the UPR , a stress-response program that re-establishes cellular homeostasis by the combinatorial action of specific transcription factors , binding to ER stress-responsive elements in the regulatory regions of UPR target genes reviewed in Ron and Walter15 . To test whether CCCP induces ER stress , we cloned a luciferase reporter construct containing the ER stress-responsive element ERSE-II ERSE-II-luc , Supplementary Figure 5 . Treatment of cells transiently expres-sing the luciferase reporter construct with tunicamycin TM induced an increase in luciferase expression , demonstrating the functionality of this ER stress reporter construct Figure 1d . Moreover , CCCP was also able to significantly increase luciferase expression from ERSE-II-luc Figure 1d . In addition , we quantified mRNA levels of the ER chaperone BiP , which is a major target of the UPR . CCCP treatment caused an upregula-tion of BiP mRNA , indicating that the mitochondrial toxin CCCP can induce ER stress Figure 1e . Parkin gene expression is upregulated in response to ER stress . In a next step , we tested whether expression of parkin is influenced by ER stress . SH-SY5Y cells were incubated with either the ER Ca2 ? -ATPase inhibitor thapsigargin TG or the N-glycosylation inhibitor TM . Both ER stressors significantly increased the levels of parkin mRNA with a maximum at 12 h after treatment Figures 2a and b . Another classical inducer of ER stress is amino acid starvation . We therefore made use of L-histidinol , a histidine analog , which inhibits activation of histidine by histidyl-tRNA synthetase . Also in this ER stress paradigm , parkin mRNA levels increased Figure 2c . Notably , the upregulation of parkin under ER stress , induced by TG , TM or L-histidinol , was also observed on the protein level Figures 2d–f , and was not restricted to SH-SY5Y cells , as a significant upregulation of parkin in response to TG or TM treatment was also observed in HEK293T cells , mouse embryonic fibroblasts MEF and primary mouse cortical neurons Figures 2g–i . Interestingly , the upregulation of parkin upon ER stress in not dependent on PINK1 expression data not shown . Parkin is a target of the UPR through the PERK ATF4 pathway . To test whether the putative ATF4-binding site within the parkin promoter mediates upregulation of parkin in response to ER stress , we created a luciferase reporter construct using the pGL3-luc promoter vector containing the putative ATF4-binding site in triplicate in front of a sequence coding for luciferase park-luc , Figure 3a . As a positive control , we cloned the confirmed ATF4-binding site of the IGFBP1 promoter21 analogously to the park-luc construct . This control construct was termed ATF4-responsive element ATF4RE -luc Figure 3a . As a negative control , we cloned a mutant park-luc construct , harboring two point mutations in the putative ATF4-binding motif mut . park-luc , Figure 3a . We tested park-luc in comparison with ATF4RE-luc under ER stress conditions and observed that luciferase expression from both reporter constructs was increased to a similar extent , whereas mutant park-luc behaved like the pGL3-luc vector control , both in HEK293T and SH-SY5Y cells Figure 3b . Of note , CCCP treatment also induced increased transcription from both ATF4RE-luc and park-luc Supplementary Figures 1A and B . Moreover , forced expression of ATF4 or upstream PERK also activated transcription from park-luc Figure 3C . In line with this observation , dominant-negative ATF4DN , which lacks the N-terminal transcriptional activation domain , 22 significantly interfered with the ER stress-induced activation of park-luc Figure 3d . To increase experimental evidence for a role of endogen-ous ATF4 in mediating the transcriptional upregulation of parkin under ER stress , we knocked down ATF4 expression by RNAi . SH-SY5Y cells were transfected with ATF4 small-interfering RNA siRNA or control siRNA , and the efficiency of the ATF4 knockdown was verified at the mRNA and protein level Figure 4a , right panel . Of note , ATF4 is specifically mRNA parkin fold primary mouse cortical neurons induced after ER stress , whereas under non-stress conditions expression levels are low . Remarkably , in ATF4-deficient cells , the upregulation of parkin induced by ER stress TG or mitochondrial stress CCCP was significantly reduced Figure 4a , left panel . The same results were obtained employing two different ATF4-specific siRNA duplexes data not shown . Moreover , we analyzed the transcriptional regulation of parkin in primary cortical neurons derived from ATF4-knockout mice.23 The upregulation of parkin on ER stress was significantly reduced in ATF4-deficient neurons Figure 4b , indicating that ATF4 indeed has an important role in the stress-induced regulation of parkin expression . Interestingly , in our experimental approach , a transient downregulation of ATF4 had a more severe effect on the stress-induced regulation of parkin than a stable knockout of ATF4 . It is conceivable that compensatory effects in ATF4-knockout mice account for this observation . + TM ? -parkin ? -actin Finally , binding of ATF4 to the parkin promoter could be demonstrated by chromatin immunoprecipitation ChIP assays using a polyclonal anti-ATF4 antibody . A rabbit polyclonal antibody pAb against chicken IgG was used as a nonspecific control . After isolation of crosslinked chromatin from cells incubated with or without TG , immunoprecipitated DNA was analyzed by real-time PCR . The ChIP analysis revealed specific binding of ATF4 to the parkin promoter after 2 and 8 h of TG treatment in both HEK293T and SH-SY5Y cells Figure 4c . c-Jun acts as a transcriptional repressor of parkin and has a dominant effect on ATF4 . When we performed electrophoretic mobility shift assays using the putative ATF4-binding site of the parkin promoter as a radiolabeled probe park oligo , we observed a second complex in addition to the ATF4–DNA complex . This complex showed a reduced mobility in comparison with the ATF4–park oligo complex , and its relative intensity was increased after ER stress Figure 5a , lanes 1 , 2 . By testing various antibodies against *** 293T 4 2.5 vector park park ATF4RE vector park park ATF4RE kDa ATF4 park ATF4 park ATF4 park luc-reporter transcription factors that could bind to the CREB ATF site for their potential to supershift the upper band , we found that c-Jun is also able to bind to the park oligo . The respective mRNA 6 l l l contro siRNA ATF4 siRNA contro siRNA ATF4 siRNA contro siRNA ATF4 siRNA ? -ATF4 ? -actin band was supershifted by an anti-c-Jun antibody Figure 5a , lane 3 and was competed by an excess of unlabeled park oligo Figure 5a , lane 5 . To test whether c-Jun might have an impact on the transcriptional regulation of parkin , we first analyzed the effect of c-Jun on the park-luc reporter construct . Interestingly , increased levels of c-Jun significantly reduced transcription from park-luc under ER stress Figure 5b . Moreover , c-Jun suppressed the ATF4-induced activation of park-luc , both under basal and ER stress conditions , indicating a dominant-negative effect Figure 5c . Next we performed a c-Jun knockdown approach by RNAi . c-Jun-specific siRNA duplexes were transfected into SH–SY5Y cells , resulting in a reduction of c-Jun mRNA by B87 % under normal conditions and by B69 % under ER stress conditions Supplementary Figure 2 . The knockdown efficiency was also verified at the protein level Figure 5d , cold probe c-Jun ATF4 AB100x AB park or antibody oligo TG 2 ? M -+ + + + hot probe park oligo c-Jun ATF4 10 mRNA induction 4 * fold 2 ? -c-Jun ? -actin lower panel . Notably , in c-Jun-deficient cells , parkin upregulation in response to ER stress was significantly increased and also in non-stressed cells more parkin was expressed when c-Jun was silenced Figure 5d , upper panel . These results indicate that c-Jun can bind to the ATF4-binding site within the parkin promoter to mediate repression of parkin expression . c-Jun is a major target of JNKs , a subfamily of the MAPK superfamily . JNK1 and JNK2 are ubiquitously expressed , whereas JNK3 is primarily found in brain , heart and testes . As JNK3 has been linked to cell death in several models of neurodegene-ration reviewed in Waetzig and Herdegen24 , we tested whether it has an impact on parkin expression . Increased expression of JNK3 indeed significantly suppressed trans-cription from the park-luc construct Figure 5e . Moreover , treatment of cells with the JNK inhibitor SP600125 increased 12 *** parkin mRNA and protein levels both under stress and non-stress conditions Figure 5f . Parkin protects cells from ER stress-induced cell death . Conceptually , upregulation of parkin in response to ER stress might help to preserve cellular function and survival within the adaptive phase of the UPR . To test the capacity of parkin to protect cells from ER stress-induced toxicity , we treated SH-SY5Y cells transiently expressing wildtype wt or mutant parkin with TG or TM . Cells undergoing apoptosis were analyzed by indirect fluore-scence using an antibody specific for activated caspase-3 . In contrast to control cells and cells expressing patho - genic parkin mutants , cells overexpressing wt parkin were protected against apoptosis induced by ER stress Figure 6a . To increase evidence for a role of endogenous parkin in coping with ER stress , we analyzed the consequences of a parkin knockdown induced by RNAi . Parkin knockdown cells showed a significant increase in apoptotic cells after ER stress in comparison with control siRNA-transfected cells Figure 6b . A decrease in the viability of parkin-deficient SH-SY5Y and HEK293T cells after ER stress was also observed by employing the MTT assay Supplementary Figures 3A and B . Notably , the increased vulnerability of parkin-deficient cells to ER stress-induced cell death could be rescued by the expression of *** control parkin parkin siRNA rescue control parkin parkin siRNA rescue siRNA-resistant parkin , confirming a parkin-specific effect Figure 6b . In addition , we analyzed the viability of MEFs derived from parkin-knockout mice25 under ER stress conditions . In comparison with MEFs derived from wt mice , the parkin-knockout MEFs showed a decreased viability under ER stress induced by TG Figure 6c . Moreover , primary skin fibroblasts from three patients with mutations in the parkin gene displayed a significant increase in cell death in response to TM treatment compared with age-and gender-matched control fibroblasts from healthy individuals Figure 6d . Of note , levels of CHOP , phospho-c-Jun and phospho-JNK , which have been associated with the proapoptotic branch of ER stress pathways , were increased in patient fibroblasts under ER stress Supplementary Figure 4 . Parkin does not decrease the level of ER stress and functions independently from the proteasome . The experiments described above established a protective role of parkin in response to ER stress . To address the question 20 mRNA c n.s . 5 4 induction 3 2 n.s . fold 1 whether parkin may have an effect on the severity of ER stress , we quantified the mRNA levels of the ER chaperone BiP in parkin-knockdown cells in response to ER stress . After ER stress induced by TG , BiP , mRNA was highly upregulated B15-fold compared with untreated cells . Interestingly , downregulation of parkin had no significant impact on BiP mRNA levels , both under basal conditions and ER stress Figure 7a . In addition , parkin-knockout MEFs did not show increased levels of BiP mRNA after TG or TM treatment when compared with control MEFs Figure 7b . These results indicated that the transient or stable loss of parkin does not cause ER stress . In line with these results , increased expression of parkin did not significantly influence the level of ER stress as monitored by luciferase reporter assays using four different ER stress-responsive elements ESRE , ERSE-II , UPR and ATF4RE , which cover all branches of the UPR Figure 7c and Supplementary Figure 5 . In a next step , we tested whether the protective activity of parkin under ER stress is dependent on the proteasome . SH-SY5Y cells were exposed to TG in the TG presence of the proteasomal inhibitor epoxomycin . First , we used a non-toxic concentration of epoxomycin 0.1 mM , which efficiently inhibited the proteasome , as shown by an increase in endogenous p53 levels and an accumulation of ubiquitylated proteins Figure 7d . Notably , the efficiency of parkin to protect against ER stress-induced cell death was not impaired when the proteasome was inhibited . Furthermore , increasing parkin expression also prevented cell death induced by a toxic concentration of epoxomycin 10 mM , indicating that protein degradation through the proteasome is not required for the acute prosurvival effect of parkin Figure 7e . Parkin interferes with ER stress-induced mitochondrial damage . Obviously , parkin does not reduce ER stress per se , but it can protect cells from ER stress-induced cell death . Based on the fact that parkin has an impact on mitochondrial integrity , 26 we analyzed the effect of ER stress on mitochondrial morphology and determined whether parkin might have a role in this pathway . SH-SY5Y cells were incubated with the fluorescent dye DiOC6 3 to visualize mitochondria in living cells by fluorescence microscopy . Under normal conditions , when mitochondrial fusion and fission activities are balanced , cells show a tubular mito-chondrial network . When fission is increased with relative to fusion , small rod-like or spherical mitochondria can be observed , which are classified as fragmented . Typically , about 70 % of SH-SY5Y cells show a tubular mitochondrial network under normal conditions , the remaining 30 % are characterized by fragmented mitochondria.26,27 ER stress , induced by either TM or TG increased the percentage of cells with fragmented mitochondria up to 70 % Figure 8a . Remarkably , enhanced expression of parkin significantly reduced ER stress-induced mitochondrial fragmentation Figures 8a and b . Moreover , we observed that parkin loss of function increases the vulnerability of cells to ER stress-induced mitochondrial dysfunction , as cellular ATP production in response to ER stress was significantly reduced in parkin-deficient SH-SY5Y cells Figure 8c . Thus , parkin maintains mitochondrial integrity under ER stress , and prevents alterations in mitochondrial morphology and bioenergetics . Discussion In this study , we show that parkin is transcriptionally upregulated by mitochondrial and ER stress via the UPR to promote viability under cellular stress . We identified the transcription factor ATF4 as a key factor in the stress-induced regulation of parkin expression , which binds to a CREB ATF site within the parkin promoter . An essential role for ATF4 in the regulation of parkin expression was substantiated by the following observations First , a dominant-negative ATF4 mutant prevented ER stress-induced upregulation of parkin . Second , in ATF4-knockdown cells and primary neurons from ATF4-knockout mice , parkin upregulation in response to ER stress was significantly impaired . Finally , we could demon-strate by a ChIP assay that ATF4 indeed binds to the parkin promoter . Our analysis also revealed that c-Jun acts as a transcriptional repressor of parkin . Intriguingly , c-Jun can bind to the same site within the parkin promoter as ATF4 to induce downregulation of parkin expression . What might be the physiological relevance of this observation ? Conceptually , c-Jun may terminate the ATF4-mediated upregulation of parkin expression by competing with ATF4 on the parkin promoter . In line with this scenario , we observed that c-Jun has a dominant effect on ATF4 it can suppress ATF4-mediated upregulation of parkin expression . It is also conceivable that severe or prolonged ER stress leads to a preferential binding of c-Jun to the parkin promoter to suppress cytoprotective pathways and to favor the elimination of irreversibly damaged cells by proapoptotic pathways . In support of this view , CHOP , a proapoptotic transcription factor activated upon severe or prolonged ER stress , suppressed parkin expression Supplementary Figure 6 . Parkin transcription was also repressed by JNK3 , a kinase upstream of c-Jun , which has been implicated in neuronal cell death pathways in dopaminergic neurons.28,29 Indeed , our data show that the use of a JNK inhibitor is able to increase parkin expression , particularly under stress conditions . Inter-estingly , parkin has been reported to suppress JNK activity in cellular models and Drosophila melanogaster.30,31 In line with these studies , we observed that phospho-JNK and phospho-c-Jun levels are increased in parkin-deficient patient fibro-blasts under ER stress Supplementary Figure 4 . Our finding that the JNK pathway can negatively regulate parkin gene expression suggests a reciprocal interaction between parkin and JNK3 , which might be instrumental in the dichotomy of cell survival and death . Depending on the cellular context and the severity of stress conditions , parkin can shift the balance towards cell survival by attenuating JNK3 signaling , whereas JNK3 gaining the upper hand , suppresses prosurvival path-ways , either directly or indirectly , for example by inhibiting the expression of parkin . The increased expression of parkin in response to ER stress clearly serves as a cytoprotective function . Cells overexpressing wt but not mutant parkin are protected against ER stress-induced cell death , whereas parkin-deficient cells show an increased vulnerability to ER stress . It will now be interesting to determine which cell types are affected in their response to stress by the loss of parkin function . On the basis of the emerging concept of non-cell autonomous cell death in neurodegeneration , it is conceivable that an impaired stress response in glial cells in the neighborhood of dopaminergic cells can contribute to nigrostriatal degeneration . Neither an acute nor a permanent loss of parkin function per se causes ER stress . Furthermore , increased parkin expression does not decrease the severity of ER stress , arguing against a direct role of parkin in the ERAD pathway . In support of this notion , the antiapoptotic activity of parkin is independent of the proteasome . We observed that proteaso-mal inhibition does not impair the ability of parkin to prevent ER stress-induced cell death . Which activity of parkin might then be responsible for its protective effect under ER stress ? In this context , it is important to note that organellar stress within cells can not be regarded in an isolated manner . In fact , our study adds evidence for an interaction between the ER and mitochondria in response to stress.32 ER stress can induce mitochondrial stress , resulting in a bioenergetic deficit and mitochondrial fragmentation . Our working model would mitochondria 50 40 30 suggest that , at this interplay , parkin seems to enter the stage , preventing the pathophysiological consequences of ER stress on mitochondrial integrity Figure 9 . The next important step will be to figure out what the precise role of parkin might be in the communication between the ER and mitochondria . DNA constructs . The following constructs were described previously wt human parkin , G430D , DUBL mutant parkin , 18 ATF4,33 ATF4DN , 22 PERK , 34 Materials and Methods c-Jun , 35 JNK3,36 Bcl-2-FLAG37 and mCherry.26 To generate siRNA-resistant parkin , four silent mutations were introduced into human wt parkin , to prevent binding of parkin-specific siRNA1 Invitrogen , Karlsruhe , Germany . The following mutations were introduced by standard PCR cloning techniques C 1038 to T , G 1044 to A , C 1053 to A and A 1059 to G. The luciferase reporter constructs were cloned by subcloning the UPR element UPRE , the ER stress response element ERSE , ERSE-II , the ATF4 binding site of the IGFBP-1 promoter ATF4RE or the ATF4 binding element of the parkin promoter PARK in triplicate flanked by NheI and BglII restriction sites into the pGL3 promoter vector Promega , Mannheim , Germany . To generate the renilla luciferase construct , the SV40 promoter from the pGL3 vector Figure 9 Interplay between ER stress , mitochondrial stress and parkin . ER stress can induce mitochondrial damage , such as alterations in mitochondrial morphology and bioenergetics . Conversely , mitochondrial stress can induce ER stress , reflected by the induction of the unfolded protein response UPR . Parkin is transcriptionally upregulated in response to both mitochondrial and ER stress by ATF4 , a transcription factor of the UPR . The stress-induced transcriptional upregulation of parkin is antagonized by c-Jun , which is activated by the JNK pathway . Increased expression of parkin under stress conditions protects cells from stress-induced cell death , explaining the high vulnerability of parkin-deficient cells to cellular stress was subcloned into the phRL-TK vector Promega , thereby replacing the HSV-TK promoter .

To detect cells undergoing apoptosis , the number of activated caspase-3-positive cells out of at least 300 transfected cells was determined using a Zeiss Axioscope 2 plus microscope Carl Zeiss , Gottingen , ¨ Germany . Quantifications were based on triplicates of at least three SH-SY5Y cells or two human skin fibroblasts independent experiments . For each experiment X300 cells per coverslip of triplicate samples were assessed . For the cell viability assays , SH-SY5Y cells , HEK293T cells or MEFs were plated into 12-well plates . SH-SY5Y cells and HEK293T cells were reversely transfected with parkin or control siRNA . Two days later , the cells were stressed with TM or TG as indicated and the Vybrant MTT Cell Proliferation Assay was performed according to manufacturer’s instructions Invitrogen . Electrophoretic mobility shift assay . Nuclear extracts were prepared as described earlier.18 For the binding reaction , 10 mg of extracts were incubated with 10 mM HEPES pH 7.9 , 50 mM NaCl , 5 mM MgCl2 , 2 mM DTT , 0.1 mM EDTA , 5 % glycerol , 10 mg BSA , 2 mg poly dI-dC and 0.2 ng 20 000 cpm of 32 P-labeled , double-stranded park oligonucleotide 50-CCCCGGTGACGTAAGATTGC-30 in a final volume of 20 ml . For supershift assays , 0.2 mg of the ATF4 antibody or 2 mg of the c-Jun N sc45X antibody , for competition experiments 50 ng 100 of cold-park oligonucleotide was added to the binding reaction . After binding on ice for 30 min , mixtures were loaded onto non-denaturating 4 % polyacrylamide gels in 0.5 TBE 45 mM Tris borate and 1 mM EDTA . Gels were electrophoresed at 41C for 4 h at 160 V , dried , and exposed for autoradiography at 801C . Chromatin immunoprecipitation . HEK293T or SH-SY5Y cells were replenished with fresh medium 12 h before initiating all treatments to ensure that the cells were in the basal state . To trigger the UPR , fresh medium containing 300 nM TG was added . To monitor ATF4 binding to the parkin gene , a ChIP assay was performed as previously described.39 The ATF4 antibody was a rabbit polycolonal antibody . Enrichment of DNA at the parkin promoter region that contains the potential ATF4 binding site was analyzed with quantitative real-time PCR . A 5 ml aliquot of DNA was mixed with 62.5 pmol of each PCR primer and 12.5 ml of SYBR Green PCR master mix Applied Biosystems in a 25 ml total volume . The real-time PCR was performed with a DNA Engine Opticon 3 system Bio-Rad . The reaction mixtures were incubated at 951C for 15 min , followed by amplification at 951C for 15 s and 601C for 60 s for 35 cycles . All experiments were performed in triplicate and each sample was subjected to PCR in duplicate . The primers used were forward 50-GTTGCTAAGCGACTGGTCAA-30 and reverse 50-CAGCCCCCCACC GCCGCC-30 . Fluorescent staining of mitochondria . SH-SY5Y cells were grown on 15 mm glass coverslips , and were fluorescently labeled with 0.1 mM DiOC6 3 in cell culture medium for 15 min . After washing the coverslips with medium , living cells were analyzed for mitochondrial morphology by fluorescence microscopy as described previously26 using a Leica DMRB microscope Leica , Wetzlar , Germany . Cells were categorized in two classes according to their mitochondrial morphology tubular or fragmented . Quantifications were based on three independent experiments . For each experiment , the mitochondrial morphology of X300 transfected cells per coverslip of triplicate samples was assessed . Measurement of cellular ATP levels . A quantitative determination of ATP in SH-SY5Y cells was performed using the ATP Bioluminescence Assay Kit HS II Roche , Mannheim , Germany according to the manufacturer’s instructions . Briefly , SH-SY5Y cells were reversely transfected with the indicated siRNA duplexes . Twenty four hours before collecting , the culture medium was replaced by low-glucose medium containing 3 mM instead of 25 mM glucose . Five hours , before the measurement , cells were treated with 2 mg ml TM . Cells were washed twice with PBS , scraped off the plate and then lysed according to the provided protocol . The ATP content of the samples was determined using an LB96 V luminometer Berthold Technologies , analyzed with WinGlow Software Berthold Technologies and normalized to total protein levels . Quantification was based on at least three independent experiments . For each experiment , each transfection was performed at least in triplicate . Bioinformatics . Transcription factor TF BSs were identified by the TFSEARCH20 and the MatInspector40 program . All sequences were derived from the promoter sequence retrieval database ElDorado 02-2010 Genomatix , Munich , Germany . Promoter sequences of parkin from four different mammalian species were aligned with the DiAlign TF program40 in the Genomatix software suite GEMS Launcher to evaluate the overall promoter similarity and to identify conserved CREB ATF BSs . The promoter sequences were defined as in ElDorado and elongated at the 30 end of the promoter downstream by 150 bp . Position weight and matrices were used according to Matrix Family Library Version 8.2 Genomatix January 2010 for promoter analyses . The BSs were considered as ‘conserved BSs’ if the promoter sequences of human and the orthologs can be aligned in the region of CREB ATF BSs with the help of the DiAlign TF program using default settings .

21426924	Chronic granulomatous disease CGD is a rare inherited single-gene disorder in which generation of superoxide by the reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate NADPH oxidase complex in phagocytic leukocytes is absent or markedly deficient [ 1 ] . This membrane-associated complex generates large quantities of superoxide during the respiratory burst by catalyzing the transfer of electrons from NADPH to oxygen . Superoxide and its derivatives are essential for normal microbicidal activity [ 2 ] . Beginning in infancy and early childhood , patients with CGD suffer from recurrent life-threatening infections . The disease is caused by mutations in any of the four genes encoding the subunits i.e. p22phox , gp91phox , p47phox , and p67phox of phagocyte NADPH oxidase . Approximately 70 % of the CGD cases result from defects in the X-linked gene encoding gp91phox , the larger subunit of flavocyto-chrome b558 , which is the redox center of the oxidase . Because there is no replacement therapy , medical manage-ment involves administration of prophylactic antibiotics and aggressive treatment of infections [ 3 ] . The only cura-tive procedure is bone marrow BM transplantation , which is associated with high mortality and morbidity in non human leukocyte antigen-matched donors [ 4,5 ] . Gene therapy is a promising therapeutic alternative since studies from female carriers indicate that correction of the respiratory burst activity in as low as 10 % of circulating phagocytes can decrease susceptibility to infections [ 6,7 ] . Several gene therapy trials [ 8–12 ] for X-CGD have been completed , but permanent patient correction has not been recorded . Two patients reported in the Ott trial [ 8 ] managed to eradicate pre-existing infections after reinfusion of their autologous gene-modified cells . However , severe adverse effects were observed after insertional activation in the MDS1-EVI1 gene also known as the MECOM locus and the genes encoding PRDM16 and SETBP1 [ 9 ] . Other obsta-cles encountered in the X-CGD clinical trials have been transgene silencing and low marking rates of corrected cells 0.03 0.1 % in the peripheral blood [ 12 ] . New improved vector designs that will confer higher rates of gene transfer into hematopoietic stem cells HSCs combined with high enzymatic activity per vector copy number and enhanced safety features should enable more efficient gene therapy applications for CGD [ 3,13 ] . In this study , we introduce foamy virus FV based vectors as novel therapeutic vehicles for the genetic correc-tion of X-CGD . FV vectors are derived from the nonpatho-genic foamy or spumaretroviruses and have several properties that distinguish them from gammaretroviruses or lentiviruses [ 14–16 ] . Some important features of the FV vectors include a self-inactivating vector design with silent long terminal repeats LTRs , a broad host range and tissue tropism , and a large packaging capacity . FV vectors are espe-cially effective at transducing HSCs of murine [ 17 ] , human [ 18–22 ] , and canine origin [ 23,24 ] , making them promising vectors for the treatment of genetic hematological disorders . Insertional analysis of FV vectors revealed that , unlike murine leukemia virus MLV and lentiviral vectors , they showed no preference for transcribed genes however , once inserted into these , their preference for integrating near promoters and CpG islands was lower than those of MLV [ 18,22–25 ] . In the present study , we sought to evaluate the gene trans-fer and expression efficiency of FV vectors in vitro and in vivo for the genetic correction of X-CGD . Based on the deleted DF.FV vectors described by Trobridge et al. [ 26 ] , we have constructed two vectors that express a codon-optimized gp91phox transgene the vectors showed stable long-term expression of gp91phox and functional reconstitu-tion of the respiratory burst oxidase activity in the human X-CGD PLB-985 cell line . In murine Lin cells , FV vectors conferred functional expression of gp91phox and restoration of NADPH oxidase activity in the peripheral blood when transplanted in the X-CGD mouse model , indicating the potential of this vector design for future clinical applications . Materials and methods Animals and transplantation Animals were kept at the BRFAA Animal Facility in microisolator cages provided with irradiated food and autoclaved water . Experiments were approved by the Institutional and Regional Review Board Committees . Cell lines and differentiation conditions The human X-CGD PLB-985 cell line DSMZ Cell lines Bank , Braunschweig , Germany was derived from the PLB-985 myelo-monocytic leukemia cell line after disruption of the gp91phox gene by homologous recombination [ 2 ] . The PLB-985 cell lines and their derivatives were grown in RPMI complemented with 10 % heat-inactivated FBS , 2 mM L-glutamine , and 1 % PenStrep 100 U mL penicillin , 100 mg mL streptomycin all by GIBCO Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA , USA . For granulocytic differentia-tion , cells were exposed to 0.5 % dimethylformamide Sigma Aldrich , Steinheim , Germany for 6 days [ 2 ] . 293T and HT1080 cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium GIBCO Invitrogen with identical supplements as mentioned here . FV constructs and vector production Self-inactivating FV vectors [ 26,27 ] were used to clone the codon optimized human gp91phox transgene GeneArt , Heidelberg , Germany , www.geneart.com transgene expression was controlled by the mouse Pgk promoter P.gp91-co . In the M.gp91-co.IF vector , transgene expression was driven by the murine stem cell virus MSCV LTR promoter and green fluorescent protein GFP was expressed via the internal ribosomal entry site 2 IRES-2 . FV vector stocks were generated by calcium phospha-te mediated transient transfection in 293T cells as described [ 26,27 ] . Briefly , 3.0E ? 06 cells were plated at day 1 , and on day 2 cells were transfected with 12 mg M.gp91-co.IF or P.gp91-co , 12 mg pCiGS , 1.5 mg pCiPS , and 0.8 mg pCiES in 800 mL total transfection volume per 10-cm dish . Concentrated vector stocks were produced by ultracentrifugation at 40,000g for 4 hours at 20 C. Titers for vectors carrying the GFP expression cassette were determined on HT1080 cells by flow cytometry . Vector titers for non-GFP vectors were determined on HT1080 cells by real-time polymerase chain reaction PCR . In brief , HT1080 cells were transduced with different amounts of vector stock and cultured for 14 days . Genomic DNA extraction was performed by standard protocol [ 28 ] and 250 ng were amplified in dupli-cate 25-mL reactions using an ABI Prism 7000 instrument Applied Biosystems , Foster City , CA , USA . FV genome detec-tion was carried out using SYBR Green master mix Applied Biosystems or Stratagene , La Jolla , CA , USA using the following primers FV-Forward 50-CTGGAATGTTACTCAAAGAGCTGTTT-30 FV-Reverse 50-TGGAACAGGATGCTGCATTCT-30 . Standards were serial dilutions of an FV plasmid while the RNase P gene was used as the endogenous control for genomic DNA their threshold cycle Ct values were plotted in standard curves . These values were then used to extrapolate the number of cells per reaction and the vector copy number . The formula [ vector copy number cell number dilution factor ] was used to deduce the integrating units per milliliter IU mL . In prelimi-nary experiments , we used a standard FV-GFP vector to compare this technique with flow cytometry and we confirmed a high corre-lation of GFP TU mL and IU mL with an R2 coefficient of 0.982 data not shown . DNA from untransduced cells was used as a negative control . Transduction of X-CGD PLB-985 cells and flow cytometry Cells were transduced by a single 18-to 20-hour exposure to vector stock at a multiplicity of infection MOI of 3 on fibronectin frag-ment CH296 Takara Bio Inc , Otsu , Japan coated 24-well plates NUNC ThermoScientific , Roskilde , Denmark . Human gp91phox expression was determined by staining with murine monoclonal antibody 7D5 Takara Bio Inc followed by phycoerythrin-conjugated rat anti-mouse antibody BD Pharmingen , San Diego , California , USA . Discrimination of live and dead cells was done by 7-aminoactinomycin D staining . Acquisition and analysis of GFP and gp91phox expression was performed on an FC500 Beck-man-Coulter , Brea , CA , USA . Cell sorting was performed on a FACSAria Becton Dickinson , Franklin Lake , NJ , USA . Murine BM cells were harvested from the femurs and tibias of gp91phox knockout X-CGD mice [ 29 ] obtained from Jax Mice B6.129S-Cybbtm1Din J , Jackson Laboratory , Bar Harbor , ME , USA at approximately 7 to 10 weeks of age . BM Lin progeni-tors were isolated using a StemSep mouse progenitor enrichment cocktail Stemcell Technologies , Vancouver , BC , Canada following manufacturer’s instructions . BM Lin cells were cultured in StemSpan Stemcell Technologies serum-free medium supplemented with 1 % penicillin streptomycin , 5 % fetal calf serum , and the following cytokines murine stem cell factor at 10 ng mL , human interleukin-6 at 10 ng mL , human FTL3 at 50 ng mL all by PeproTech EC Ltd , London , UK . Cells were transduced for 18 to 20 hours and the following day they were either cultured in methylcellulose for the ex vivo experiments or intravenously injected in X-CGD female recipients for the in vivo experiments . Methylcellulose culture Briefly , transduced BM Lin cells were plated at 1.0E ? 03 mL in methylcellulose medium MethoCult Stem Cell Technologies . Nontransduced control cells were subjected to the same manipula-tions as transduced cells . Fourteen days after plating , colonies were examined for GFP expression and or assayed for nitrobluete-trazolium NBT reduction . Transplantation of transduced BM Lin cells in X-CGD mice Female X-CGD mice of 7 to 10 weeks of age were partially mye-loablated by intraperitoneal injections of Busilvex Pierre Fabre , Boulogne , France [ 30 ] . Titration experiments determined the maximum tolerated dose without hematopoietic cell transplanta-tion to be 20 mg kg Busilvex per day for 4 days before transplan-tation in X-CGD animals . The transduced BM Lin cells were resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline and 0.5 to 2.0 E ? 05 transduced male cells were injected intravenously to the recipi-ents . Mice were sacrificed at week 15 to 20 post-transplantation and the average BM chimerism achieved with this regime was found to be 32 % to 51 % in X-CGD animals . The NBT assay was used to evaluate superoxide production in myeloid colonies grown in methylcellulose cultures at day 14 . For the NBT test , 0.5 mL 0.1 % NBT Sigma Aldrich , Steinheim , Germany with 0.5 mg mL phorbol myristate acetate PMA Sigma Aldrich in RPMI was layered over colony cultures . The cultures were incubated at 37 C , 5 % CO2 and after 1 hour of incubation , 2 mL of 1.5 % of paraformaldehyde and phosphate-buffered saline was added to halt the reaction and fix the cells . After several washes , gels were left to dry and colonies were scored under an inverted microscope for the presence of blue formazan precipitates formed from NBT dye reduction . GFP expression by myeloid colonies was assessed with living cultures before any staining or fixation using a fluorescence micro-scope Leica , DMLS2 . Peripheral blood was obtained from the tail vein or the heart of the mice at sacrifice , red blood cells were lysed with hypotonic solution and 1 mL NBT mix 0.1 % NBT , 0.5 ug mL PMA was incubated with cells for 15 minutes at 37 C. Cells were fixed and cytospin smears were made . After drying the slides , cells were fixed in methanol and counterstained with 0.5 % safranin . The same procedure , except for the lysis step , was followed for the X-CGD PLB-985 cells after granulocytic differentiation with 0.5 % dimethylformamide . For all the samples , NBT was per-formed with and without PMA stimulation and in every set there was a negative and a positive control , i.e. , nontransduced X-CGD cells and wild-type wt normal cells . The superoxide production in the peripheral blood of the mice was quantitated by the dihydrorhodamine DHR -123 method Phagoburst OpergenPharma , Heidelberg , Germany following manufacturer’s instructions . This assay detects reactive oxidants by conversion of DHR-123 to rhodamine-123 using flow cytometry . It detects both the percentage of active phagocytic cells and their oxidase activity after PMA induction . A gate was established to include live cells and another to include neutrophils based on forward and side scatter characteristics . The samples were periph-eral blood from X-CGD mice , wt C57 Bl6 mice , and transplanted X-CGDmiceandwereanalyzedwithandwithoutPMAstimulation . The rhodamine-123 emission was measured on the FL1 channel . Genomic DNA from BM of transplanted mice was extracted and was assayed by real-time PCR for FV vector copies and for male donor TSPY gene copies [ 31 ] . Standard curves of the threshold cycle Ct values were generated for the FV vector using different amounts of a FV vector plasmid and for TSPY gene copies using different numbers of male mouse cells . The primers for the amplification of FV genome were as described here , while for the murine Y chromosome TSPY [ 31 ] they were as follows TSPY-Forward 50-TCCTTGGGCTCTTCATTATTCTTAAC-3 TSPY-Reverse 50-GAGAACCACGTTGGTTTGAGATG-30 . Endogenous glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase GAPDH was quantified using the rodent GAPDH primers provided by Applied Biosystems . Our negative control was DNA from untransduced cells . Results Construction of vectors using three different gp91phox transgenes For vector construction , we used the human gp91phox complementary DNA cDNA and cloned it into a vector transgenes , but in this setting we found that it was manda-tory for efficient protein expression . gp91phox expression by FV vectors reconstitutes superoxide production in the X-CGD PLB-985 cell line In order to test the functional competence of our vectors , we transduced the X-CGD PLB-985 myeloid cell line with P.gp91-co and a second vector M.gp91-co.IF that had the MSCV promoter driving the codon-optimized gp91phox cDNA and the GFP reporter off an IRES 2 sequence Figs . 1A and 2A all transductions were performed at low MOI i.e. , 2 3 . Transduced cells were enriched to O80 % purity after antibody staining and flow-sorting for the gp91phox-expressing cells . In order to determine persistence of expression , we checked for transgene expression over an extended time in culture we observed that by day 34 , nearly 78 % of the cells stained positive for gp91phox Fig. 2B indi-cating a subtle shift in gp91phox expression . To quantitate the gp91phox protein levels , we used the mean fluorescence intensity MFI of the transduced cells after antibody stain-ing and analysis by flow cytometry . When compared to wt PLB-985 cells , transduced cells expressed gp91phox at levels reaching 90 % and 80 % of those obtained with the positive control at days 7 and 34 , respectively . In order to test the enzymatic activity in the transduced cells , we used the NBT assay , which is commonly used as a diagnostic test for the disease . This assay is based on the oxidation of a yellow dye that forms blue formazan precipitates within the cells when NADPH activity is normal . After granulocytic differentiation with 0.5 % dimethylformamide treatment , superoxide production was assessed by the NBT assay after activation of the cells with PMA . Our results showed that in the transduced X-CGD PLB-985 cells , visible formazan precipitates were formed by reduction of the NBT dye Fig. 2C , indicating the functional reconstitution of the superoxide production . No NBT-positive cells were observed in the nontransduced X-CGD PLB-985 cells whether treated with PMA or not . Importantly , the functional correction of the X-CGD PLB-985 cell line was obtained with 1.7 vector copies per transduced cell . Similar results were observed when the cells were trans-duced with the M.gp91-co.IF vector Fig. 2D . The titer of this vector was determined by flow cytometry and the mean n 5 11 was 1.1 6 0.648 E ? 06 TU mL . This vector allowed us to select transduced cells based on GFP expres-sion . After transduction , the GFP-positive cells were en-riched by fluorescence-activated cell sorting and analyzed for GFP and gp91phox expression . Transduced cells coex-pressed both vector-derived transgenes gp91phox and GFP at 82 % Fig. 2E . The functional competence of this vector was tested using the NBT assay , which showed that X-CGD PLB-985 cells transduced with the M.gp91-co.IF vector regained their superoxide production Fig. 2F . Collectively , our in vitro results using the deleted FV vectors with an optimized gp91phox transgene showed that they can efficiently transduce and functionally correct the X-CGD phenotype in the X-CGD PLB-985 cell line . After the successful testing of our FV vectors in the X-CGD human myeloid cell line , we then assayed vector efficacy in primary murine hematopoietic X-CGD cells . We first eval-uated the M.gp91-co.IF vector because GFP expression could facilitate titer and MOI calculations . To this end , we transduced ex vivo BM lineage-depleted BM Lin cells from X-CGD mice with the M.gp91-co.IF vector at low MOI i.e. , 2 4 . Cells were cultured in methylcellulose medium under conditions that support myeloid cell devel-opment for 12 to 14 days and pooled colony-forming units CFUs were then assayed for gp91phox expression by flow cytometry . The gene transfer efficiency ranged from 9 % to 11 % as assayed by GFP expression and by gating on the GFP-positive cells , we observed that 70 % of these also ex-pressed the gp91phox transgene Fig. 3A . The CFU-colonies were also tested with the NBT assay Fig. 3B Negative controls Fig. 3B , panels i and iv showed neither GFP expression nor any NBT precipitate . Colonies derived from the transduced BM Lin cells expressed GFP and re-gained their ability to produce superoxide as indicated by the formation of the blue formazan precipitate inside the cells Fig. 3B , panels ii , iii , and v . As expected , the ex vivo assays confirmed the ability of our FV vectors to trans-duce primary BM Lin cells and to express gp91phox in the myeloid progeny , in effect restoring superoxide production . We performed BM transplantation BMT assays with transduced BM Lin cells in the mouse model of the disease . BM Lin cells from male X-CGD donors were transduced overnight with the M.gp91-co.IF or P.gp91-co vectors at low MOI i.e. , 2 7 and sex-mismatched trans-plantation was performed in partially myeloablated recipi-ents that had received intraperitoneal injections of 20 mg kg Busilvex per day for 4 consecutive days [ 30 ] before BMT . The mice were sacrificed 15 to 19 weeks later and chimerism was assessed by quantitative Taqman PCR for the male donor TSPY gene . Mice transplanted with M.gp91-co.IF transduced cells were functionally assayed by NBT , and mice transplanted with P.gp91-co transduced cells were assessed by the quantitative DHR123 assay Phagoburst . In this assay , MFI value of the DHR123 dye reflects the enzymatic activity of NADPH in the cell popu-lation . The Phagoburst assay could not be used with the M.gp91-co.IF vector because GFP and DHR have similar emission spectra in flow cytometry . Analysis of the peripheral blood of animals transplanted with M.gp91-co.IF transduced cells revealed the presence of 0.5 % to 1.5 % NBT-positive cells , close to the observed 6 % to 11 % of NBT-positive cells in the peripheral blood of wt animals , which also reflects the normal number of neutrophils in the mouse circulation . These findings indi-cated that our M.gp91-co.IF vector had achieved a correc-tion that reached 6 % to 19 % of normal controls at 15 to 19 weeks post-BMT , clearly showing sufficient levels of expression and long-term circulation of corrected oxidase-positive cells Fig. 4A . Phagocytes in the peripheral blood formed blue formazan precipitates , as it is shown in the representative images of the NBT assay Fig. 4B . Animals transplanted with P.gp91-co transduced BM Lin cells were analyzed using the Phagoburst assay as mentioned here . A mean of 46 % range , 35 64 % of superoxide-producing cells could be detected in the wt animals and a mean of 19 % range , 11 35 % in the experimental group of the transplanted mice Fig. 4C . Overall , the levels observed in the experimental animals account for 40 % of the superoxide-producing cells that can be detected in the wt background . It has to be noted that these levels were achieved with just 32 % to 51 % chimerism in the BM . In addition , high levels of enzymatic activity as evaluated by the MFI could be seen in the corrected neutrophils of the transplanted mice , which reached 70 % of normal . The level of oxidase production on a per neutrophil basis , which in our case correlated to a 3.4-fold increase from the levels detected in the X-CGD mice Fig. 4D , is as crucial for restoration of immunity as the percentage of corrected neutrophils in the blood [ 3,8 ] . For the transplanted mice with functional neutrophil numbers in their peripheral blood , the vector copy number was 1.36 to 2.4 per engrafted Y cell . From the in vivo results , we concluded that the FV vectors can support long-term expression of gp91phox in the transplanted X-CGD mice and provide sustained and high enzymatic activity in circulating neutrophils , with a maximum of 2.4 integrated transgene copies per cell . Discussion In this study , we show that FV vector mediated transfer of the codon-optimized gp91phox can reconstitute respiratory burst activity in vitro in the X-CGD PLB-985 cell line , ex vivo in primary murine HSCs , and in vivo in the X-CGD mouse model of the disease . This is the first study to evaluate the gene transfer potential of FV vectors in X-CGD and one of the few published studies on the poten-tial of FV vectors for gene transfer in HSC [ 23 ] . We have achieved genetic correction in the animal model of the disease using gene-modified cells with low vector copies per chimeric cell and a partial myeloablative protocol , indicating the potential of FV vectors for future clinical development . In our study , we used FV vectors with minimal viral sequences based on the DF.FV vector backbone [ 26 ] . These are safety-enhanced vectors with a self-inactivating design and extended deletions in the gag and pol sequences , which eliminate the possibility of viral recombination and production of replication-competent proviruses in the trans-duced cells . The LTR transactivator Tas Bel-1 , which is important for expression of the wt genome , is deleted , leaving the transgene promoter as the sole transcriptionally active element in the vector . The integration preference of FV for nontranscribed genes and the less frequent than gammaretrovirus integrations near transcription start sites , combined with the lack of pathogenicity , makes them suit-able for clinical applications [ 33 ] . We constructed FV vectors expressing a codon-optimized transgene for gp91phox , because the use of other cDNAs that had earlier been used in gammaretroviruses [ 8,10 ] was suboptimal in the context of FV vectors . Although the codon-optimized gp91phox had a marginal negative effect on vector titers compared to nonoptimized cDNAs , its use was mandatory for gp91phox gene expression . Codon-optimization of the gp91phox cDNA has also been used by Moreno-Carranza et al. [ 13 ] , where they achieved a 10-fold increase in self-inactivating gammaretroviral vector titers . In our study , concentrated FV vector titers were marginally over 1.0 E ? 06 TU mL , which is , on average , six times less compared to the titers we obtain with a standard GFP transgene data not shown this titer drop is also in accor-dance with previous findings [ 13 ] . This shows that gp91phox may impair RNA processing or particle assembly but not to a degree that would prevent further experimentation with the vector . We first tested our vectors in the X-CGD PLB-985 myeloid cell line , which harbors a deletion in gp91phox gene transduction with either P.gp91-co or M.gp91-co.IF vector resulted in efficient and stable gene transfer , achieving potentially therapeutic levels with low copy numbers less than 2 per transduced cell . These attributes , which are essential for gene transfer , set up the basis for further experimentation with the vectors in vivo . In order to develop a clinically simulated protocol for our animal studies , we conditioned animals with Busilvex [ 30 ] , the form of busulfan that is used for human myeloablative conditioning before BMT . X-CGD mice transplanted with this protocol showed an average BM chimerism of 38 % n 5 12 , and we could detect 0.5 % to 1.5 % of NBT-positive cells in their peripheral blood for at least 20 weeks post-BMT . Given that the percentage of NBT-positive cells within the wt peripheral blood was 8 % , the in vivo cellular correction accounted for 6 % to 19 % of wt levels . In BMT studies with retroviral vectors where transplantation was per-formed after low-dose irradiation protocols 160 cGy , NADPH oxidase reconstitution , as assayed by NBT , was observed in 1 % to 17 % of cells [ 34 ] . Even when lethal irradi-ation was used before BMT , where 100 % BM chimerism is usually achieved , the NBT-positive cells in the peripheral blood did not surpass 23 % [ 35–38 ] . The NBT-positive cells that we detected were within the range obtained using retro-viral vectors and at levels sufficient for phenotypic correction considering that female X-CGD carriers with skewed X-chromosome inactivation and low numbers 5 10 % of wt neutrophils were not susceptible to infections [ 6 ] . We also accurately quantitated the percentage of cor-rected cells in the peripheral blood of the transplanted mice with the DHR assay , which is used as a diagnostic test for the disease [ 39 ] . For these experiments , we used the P.gp91-co vector , which lacks the GFP marker gene . We observed high percentage up to 34 % of corrected circu-lating neutrophils in the transplanted X-CGD mice that accounts for nearly 40 % of the wt levels , arguing for a potential therapeutic effect . Because the oxidase activity of circulating neutrophils is as important as the percentage of oxidase-producing cells in blood circulation , we used the MFI values to estimate the enzymatic activity of the oxidase-producing neutrophils . We observed that trans-planted animals MFI-BMT contained circulating neutro-phils , with activity reaching 70 % of that seen in the wt animals MFI-wt . From the studies of women carriers of X-CGD and the clinical trials completed so far , it is clear that the partial reconstitution of superoxide production that we observed with the FV vectors can be clinically beneficial . The clinical trial of Ott et al. [ 8 ] showed that levels of activity of 15 % to 30 % of normal activity in 20 % of circulating neutrophils were sufficient for a clinical benefit such as clearance of infections [ 8 ] . The high percentage of corrected cells in combination with the high enzymatic activity that we obtained in vivo could be sufficient to provide protection against bacterial infections . Previous studies have shown that FV vectors mediate efficient and stable gene transfer into human CD34 ? hematopoietic cells [ 20,21 ] , a property that will enable us to test the efficiency of the vectors in CD34 ? cells from X-CGD patients . However , in our current study , we set up the basis for development of FV vectors for the genetic correction of CGD we showed that the FV vectors can provide sustained long-term expression of the gp91phox transgene and a high percentage of superoxide-producing cells in the peripheral blood of transplanted X-CGD mice . Despite the low BM chimerism achieved with our partial myeloablative protocol , we observed high numbers of cor-rected neutrophils with low vector copy number per chimeric cell . Taking into consideration that FV vectors have high gene transfer rates in human hematopoietic cells , we argue that FV vectors are strong candidates for human gene therapy in X-CGD .

Under pathological conditions , angiogenesis and lymphan-giogenesis induced by tumor cells accelerate the rapid growth and metastasis of the tumor He et al. 2005 Roskoski 2007 . A relationship between expression of vascular endothelial growth factor family members VEGFs and tumor angiogenesis or lymphangiogenesis has been reported in a variety of cancers Roskoski 2007 Lohela et al. 2009 . As the tumor grows , the reduced concentration of oxygen at the core of the tumor induces the expression of members of the VEGF family by up-regulating hypoxia-inducible fac-tor , resulting in the formation of new blood vessels from host blood vessels Das et al. 2005 . Vascular endothelial growth factor-A VEGF-A , a diffusible endothelial cell–specific mitogen and the most potent directly acting angiogenic protein known Ferrara et al. 2003 Helotera Alitalo 2007 Lohela et al. 2009 , has been studied extensively . In different types of cancer , VEGF-A is over-expressed by carcinoma cells and facilitates tumor growth as well as metastasis by stimulating the proliferation and migration of endothelial cells , increasing tumor blood vessel den-sity and accelerating angiogenesis Ferrara et al. 2003 Lee et al. 2007 . Recently , VEGF-A has been showed 626 Genes to Cells 2011 16 , 625–638 tumor formation formed tumors indistinguishable from those of MS-K SCR-C -or MS-K Normal -inoculated mice . These results are in contrast to previous reports that the ability of vegf-C-knockdown carcinoma cells to form tumors was suppressed Shibata et al. 2008 . No differences were detected in the number of white blood cells WBC among mice inoculated with MS-K C-KD , MS-K SCR-A , MS-K Normal or MS-K A-KD cells . In contrast , the number of plate-lets PLT and hematocrit Hct decreased gradually until day 30 in mice inoculated with MS-K C-KD , MS-K SCR-A or MS-K Normal cells , whereas no changes were observed in mice inoculated with MS-K A-KD cells Fig. 2C , D . Quantitative analysis showed that the concentration of VEGF-A in the serum of MS-K Normal -inoculated mice increased 100 gradually and by day 18 reached a level 3.7 times higher than that observed on day 0 Table 1 . Fig-ure 2E shows an overview of tumors derived from MS-K Normal -inoculated mice on day 14 and 35 . Notably , the blood vessels arteries connected to the tumors at day 35 were larger than those observed at day 14 . Although the MS-K Normal -inoculated mice formed large tumors by day 35 , expression of the egfp gene was detected only in the tumor , and not in brain , lung , liver , spleen or bone marrow by PCR Fig. 2F , indicating that the MS-K Normal tumors did not metastasize . PCR analysis of tumors derived from MS-K C-KD -or MS-K SCR-C -inoculated mice showed expression of the vector-specific puromycin gene on days 10 , 18 and 28 Fig. 2G , indicating that the Weight 4 pSilencer vector-mediated suppression of vegf-C expression in those MS-K clones continued through day 28 . These results indicate that suppression of vegf-C had no significant effect on the tumorigenicity of MS-K . 628 Genes to Cells 2011 16 , 625–638 E Day 14 Day 35 30 30 30 cont . cont . G II 30 Histological analysis of MS-K tumors Thin sections of MS-K tumors harvested on day 17 post-inoculation were stained with hematoxylin and eosin H E . No obvious necrosis was observed . Well-developed blood vessels were observed in tumors Fig. 3A , B , C . Immunohistochemical staining with anti-CD31 showed the existence of endothelial Table 1 Quantification of Vascular endothelial growth factor-A VEGF-A in serum of MS-K Normal -inoculated mice Days after MS-K Conc. of VEGF-A inoculation in serum pg ? mL cells and long blood vessels in MS-K tumors Fig. 3D , E , F . The presence of these blood vessels may be one of the reasons which explains non-necrosis in MS-K tumors . VEGF-A-dependent growth of MS-K A-KD Interestingly , although the growth curve of MS-K A-KD cells in vitro was almost the same as that of control MS-K Normal cells in the presence of 10 % HS Fig. 1D , the MS-K A-KD cells did not form any tumors in vivo Fig. 2A . Furthermore , the growth of MS-K A-KD cells under low serum con-ditions was slower than that of the control MS-K Normal cells Fig. 4A ? B , and the colony-forming ability of MS-K A-KD cells in semi-solid medium was lower than that of MS-K Normal cells Fig. 4C . Quantification of VEGF-A in the culture medium showed that the production of VEGF-A by MS-K A-KD cells was approximately half of that of colonies 630 Genes to Cells 2011 16 , 625–638 B 100 cells 1 D 500 dish 400 300 colonies No. 100 aFLT-1 Table 2 Quantification of VEGF-A in cultured conditioned medium of MS-K Cell 0.1 2.0 MS-K Normal 444.8 ± 11.6 pg ? mL 893.2 ± 8.9 MS-K SCR-A 241.2 ± 13.6* 879.2 ± 0.3 MS-K A-KD 217.3 ± 8.2* 894.7 ± 11.3 Without cells ND 15.2 ± 7.6 the MS-K Normal cells under low serum conditions Table 2 . These results indicated that the knockdown of vegf-A suppressed the production of VEGF-A . Addition of recombinant VEGF-A165 into the semi-solid medium partially rescued colony formation by MS-K A-KD cells in a dose-dependent manner Fig. 4D . However , quantitative analysis of the expression of vegf-r1 showed that there was no signif-icant difference between MS-K A-KD cells and MS-K Normal cells Fig. 4E . Western blotting analysis showed that phosphorylation of the VEGF-r 1 FLT-1 was enhanced approximately 1.2 times than that of control within 3 min by the stimulation with recombinant VEGF-A165 in MS-K Normal Fig. 4F . These results suggested that the VEGF-r-1 in the MS-K Normal was functionally active for signal transduction . Establishment of vegf-r 1-knockdown-MS-K R1-KD clones and tumor formation For further analysis of the role of the VEGF on growth of MS-K cells , vegf-r 1-knockdown-MS-K clones were obtained using pSilencer-4.1-CMV-puro- mycin and pSilencer-4.1-CMV-hygromycinB Fig . 5A , B . The expression level of the vegf-r 1 in these clones p4 , h1 , h2 , h3 and h4 reduced significantly 45.6 % , 16.9 % , 1.8 % , 9.6 % and 2.9 % of the level in MS-K Normal , respectively . Expression of antibiotics gene in these clones was also confirmed by RT-PCR Fig. 5A ? B . Both MS-K R1-KD , clone p4 and MS-K R1-KD , clone h2 were chosen from among the clones for further experiment . As both the growth and colony-forming ability of MS-K A-KD under low serum conditions were lower than those of MS-K Normal Fig. 4A ? B ? E , these characters of the MS-K R1-KD were analyzed at first . The growth curves of MS-K R1-KD cells were similar in the presence 2 % HS however , the growth of MS-K R1-KD cells was slow compared with the MS-K Normal in the presence of 0.1 % HS Fig. 5C . Col-ony formation ability between MS-K Normal and MS-K R1-KD was almost same Fig . 5D . How-ever , the expression of VEGF-r-1 Flt-1 in MS-K R1-KD , clone h2 was significantly lower compared with the MS-K Normal Fig. 5E . After inoculation of these MS-K R1-KD clones into mouse , the tumor formation had been delayed or almost sup-pressed Fig. 5F . Briefly , MS-K R1-KD , clone p4 formed tumor however , the growth was obviously delayed and the volume of tumor was significantly smaller than MS-K Normal . Another clone MS-K R1-KD , clone h2 could not form any tumor till day 28 . In MS-K R1-KD , clone p4 -inoculated mouse , the number of WBC increased gradually and the number of PLT and Hct decreased significantly at day 28 . However , in MS-K R1-KD , clone h2 -inoc-ulated mouse , no significant decrease in the number of PLT was observed Fig. 5F . Angiogenesis is the sprouting of new blood vessels from the pre-existing ones , which is initiated by the destruction of the pre-existing blood vessel walls and accelerated proliferation of endothelial cells Shibuya 2008 Karamysheva 2008 . Myocytes then grow surrounding the tubular structure assembled by endo-thelial cells to form vessels Leblanc et al. 2009 . Although the in vitro induction of the capillary from embryoid body was reported to be successful Wartenberg et al. 1998 , the mechanisms of blood vessels formation are poorly understood . However , it is well known that angiogenesis is induced in many kinds of tumor tissues to supply oxygen and nutrients for the rapid proliferation of tumor cells without angiogenesis , the tumor can not exceed 2–3 mm3 and tumor cells undergo necrosis because of hypoxia Karamysheva 2008 . Tumor growth is thus regarded as a good model for the study of angiogenesis . The A -R1 1 ? -actin C 50 10 cells No . D % 140 20 Colony 0 632 Genes to Cells 2011 16 , 625–638 mechanisms by which angiogenesis is activated during the tumor growth progress involve a number of cyto-kines and regulators in particular , the VEGFs and their cognate receptors Shibuya 2008 Leblanc et al. 2009 play a critical role . MS-K is a murine sarcoma cell line that produces both VEGF-A and VEGF-C Fig. 1A and is able to form non-necrotic tumors with well-developed blood vessel systems without metastasis Figs 2F and 3 . The most crucial step in angiogenesis is the proliferation and migration of endothelial cells for neovascularization Leblanc et al. 2009 . VEGF-A has been shown to play an important role in proliferation , survival , sprouting and migration of endothelial cells and vascular permeability Das et al. 2005 Helotera Alitalo 2007 Karamysheva 2008 . Therefore , to elucidate the effects of VEGF-A on angiogenesis and VEGF-C on lymphangiogenesis during MS-K tumor growth , VEGF-A and VEGF-C were knocked down in MS-K cells . It has been reported that the down-regulation of VEGF-A and VEGF-C in various carcinoma cells results in delayed tumor growth , inhibition of adhesion of tumor cells to the extracellular matrix and decreased tube forma-tion in tumor tissue He et al. 2008 Raskopf et al. 2008 Rangasamy et al. 2008 Shibata et al. 2008 Wang et al. 2008b . In our work , however , inhibition of vegf-A expres-sion in MS-K cells completely suppressed tumorigen-esis . When the level of vegf-A decreased to 13.9 % of the normal level , MS-K A-KD cells were unable to form any tumors in the inoculated mice even 30 days post-inoculation Fig. 2A . Interestingly , we observed that the serum dependency of the MS-K A-KD cells was different from that of MS-K Normal cells Fig. 4A ? B . The colony-forming ability of MS-K A-KD cells was also significantly lower than that of MS-K Normal cells under low serum conditions Fig. 4C . We thus suggested that the inability of MS-K A-KD cells to form tumors in vivo was partly because of their reduced proliferation capacity in the absence of vegf-A expression . These results indicated that VEGF-A ? VEGF-R1 autocrine loop signaling regulates the survival and proliferation of MS-K cells . In fact , addition of recombinant VEGF-A165 rVEGF-A partially rescued the in vitro colony formation capacity of the MS-K A-KD cells in a dose-dependent manner Fig. 4D . In this study , the RNAi target sequence for vegf-A existed in exon 4 of the vegf-A gene which was included in all isotypes of VEGF-A . Therefore , not only the native VEGF-A164 but also other native isotypes of VEGF-A , such as VEGF-A120 and VEGF-A188 , were suppressed by the pSilencer-vegf-A vector , which may explain why the addition of recombinant rVEGF-A165 only partially rescued the colony formation capacity of the MS-K A-KD cells . In addition , the expression level of vegf-r1 was not changed in MS-K A-KD cells compared with that of MS-K Normal cells Fig. 4E . Because the phosphorylation of the VEGF-R1 was induced by rVEGF-A165 in MS-K Normal cells Fig. 4F , the VEGF-R1 on MS-K was functionally active for signal transduction . It has been reported that VEGF-R1 is located not only in the plasma membrane but also in the karyo-lemma in breast cancer cells Lee et al. 2007 . There-fore , another possibility is that exogenetic VEGF-A protein can not be transported into MS-K cells to bind the receptors in the karyolemma , blocking the VEGF-A pathway in the nucleolus and suppressing the proliferation of MS-K A-KD cells . Furthermore , we established the VEGF-R1-knockdown-MS-K cells , MS-K R1-KD , and confirmed that the tumor formation of the MS-K R1-KD was delayed or sup-pressed compared with MS-K Normal Fig. 5F . Therefore , these results suggested that in addition to its traditional role as a vascular inducer , VEGF-A is also an important self-survival regulator involved in MS-K cell growth . Autocrine VEGF-A signaling has been showed in a variety of carcinoma cells , includ-ing melanoma cells , leukemia cells , prostate carcinoma cells , colon carcinoma cells , bladder tumor cells and breast carcinoma cells Mentlein et al. 2004 Weigand et al. 2005 Lee et al. 2007 Wang et al. 2008a DeMorrow 2009 Sher et al. 2009 . Considering the co-expression of VEGF-A and VEGF-R1 in MS-K cells Figs 1A and 4F and effect of knockdown of the vegf-A and vegf-r-1 in MS-K on tumor formation Figs 2 and 5 , we concluded that VEGF-A facilitated the survival and proliferation of MS-K cells through VEGF-R1 in an autocrine signaling loop . Unexpectedly , MS-K C-KD cells formed tumors indistinguishable from those formed by MS-K Normal cells upon subcutaneous inoculation Fig. 2A . The different efficiencies of VEGF-A knockdown and VEGF-C knockdown in MS-K cells may be caused by the different roles of these two fac-tors in tumor growth . The strong angiogenic activity stimulated by VEGF-A in MS-K C-KD -inoculated mice may effectively support the rapid growth of tumor tissue in contrast , the defect in VEGF-C may just influence the invasion of tumors to the lymph node region , which was not investigated in our study . The role of VEGF-A as an essential regulator of angiogenesis during tumor growth has been well documented . The autocrine action of VEGF in carci-noma cells is becoming the focus of many studies . Our study lends support to the idea that in addition to the therapy strategies focused on suppressing tumor angiogenesis , VEGF-A may also be a useful target in cancer cells themselves . Furthermore , better under-standing of the mechanisms involved in the down-stream signaling of VEGF-R1 will be crucial for the elucidation of the effect of VEGF-A and the mecha-nisms of tumorigenesis .

21501347	Introduction Altered lipid metabolism , such as hyperlipidemia and increased triglyceride stores , is an important character-istic of obesity and causes insulin-resistant states . Increase in free fatty acids FAs in plasma has been shown to impair insulin action on glucose uptake in skeletal muscle and to contribute to the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus Boden 2008 . High circu-lating FA levels increase FA uptake into muscles and stimulate FA oxidation , whereas , an oversupply of FA leads to intramuscular lipid accumulation . It has also been reported that exposure of skeletal muscle cells to saturated free FA induces insulin resistance and increased secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines Coll et al. 2008 . The two main substrates—glucose and FAs—are coordinately utilized by complex regulatory mecha-nisms in skeletal muscle Frayn 2003 . Under fed conditions , insulin stimulates glucose utilization in the skeletal muscle , whereas substrate metabolism shifts from glucose to FA under fasting conditions Kelley Mandarino 2000 . The uptake of glucose and FAs is mediated by the specific transporters for each sub-strate , and their expression and localization appear to be regulated by the activities of signaling molecules Czech 2002 . AMP-activated protein kinase AMPK is a major cellular energy sensor and a master regula-tor of metabolic homeostasis Kahn et al. 2005 Har-die 2007 Osler Zierath 2008 . AMPK is activated by any metabolic stress that generates an increase in the AMP ? ATP ratio . Genetic and pharmacologic studies showed that AMPK is required for maintain-ing glucose homeostasis Shaw et al. 2005 . In FA oxidation , AMPK inactivates acetyl-CoA carboxylase and prevents the production of malonyl-CoA , an inhibitor of long-chain FA transport into the mito-chondria , leading to the subsequent increase in b-oxi-dation Kahn et al. 2005 . Therefore , AMPK is now considered to be a potential pharmacologic target for improving insulin resistance , diabetes , and metabolic syndrome . Fatty acid-binding proteins FABPs are small cyto-solic proteins that are members of the superfamily of lipid-binding proteins Storch Thumser 2000 Furuhashi Hotamisligil 2008 . FABPs are expressed in a variety of cells , and nine molecules with different tissue distribution patterns are known at present . It has been postulated that FABPs translocate long-chain FAs to intracellular organelles , such as the mitochon-dria and nucleus Storch Thumser 2000 . FABP3 ? H-FABP is the major type expressed in the heart and skeletal muscle Claffey et al. 1987 Glatz et al. 2003 Adhikari et al. 2007 . Several studies in which FABP3-deficient mice were used have shown that FABP3 is involved in FA uptake and its oxida-tion during energy metabolism in the heart and skele-tal muscle Binas et al. 1999 Adhikari et al. 2007 . Because FABP3 is abundantly expressed in the heart and is rapidly released into the circulation after myo-cardial injury Tanaka et al. 1991 Kleine et al. 1992 , it has been used as an early marker of acute myocar-dial infarction . Previous studies have also showed that the level of FABP3 expression is increased in the skeletal muscle of mice fed a high-fat HF diet Shearer et al. 2005 . FABP3 appears to allow the muscle to switch sub-strates when different substrates are available Storlien et al. 2004 Shearer et al. 2005 . Although FABP3 is not only indispensable for the oxidation of exogenous FAs , but also helpful to glucose oxidation in skeletal muscle of mice fed a chow diet , an increase in FABP3 under HF diet conditions promotes lipid accumulation through excess FA load into skeletal muscle , which has a harmful effect on insulin sensitiv-ity and glucose oxidation Shearer et al. 2005 Adhik-ari et al. 2007 . However , there are no reports on whether or not FABP3 affects signal transduction to regulate energy metabolism in muscle , and the man-ner in which any such effect could be exerted . In this study , we first examined the relationship between FABP3 expression and the development of obesity by using brown fat uncoupling protein 1-knockout UCP1-KO mice because this mutant strain is a unique human model of diet-induced obes-ity Kontani et al. 2005 . We then investigated the effects of FABP3 induction for glucose uptake and signal transduction , including the AMPK pathway , by using C2C12 mouse skeletal muscle cells . Results FABP3 expression in the skeletal muscle correlates to obesity phenotypes in mice We determined the FABP3 mRNA levels in UCP1-KO and wild-type WT mice that had been fed stan-dard chow and HF diets to analyze the relationship between the level of FABP3 mRNA expression and body weight BW . As shown in Fig. 1A–C , the FABP3 mRNA levels in the brown adipose tissue BAT , heart and gastrocnemius muscle GM increased with an increase in the BW in both WT and UCP1-KO mice . Among the three tissues , the correlation between the level of FABP3 mRNA in the GM and BW was strongest , as indicated by the R2 values Fig. 1C . As reported in our recent study Yamashita et al. 2008 , the level of FABP3 mRNA in the BAT was consistently higher in UCP1-KO mice than in WT mice Fig. 1A . The slopes of correlation in heart and GM were significantly greater in WT mice than in UCP1-KO mice Fig. 1B , C . We next carried out Western blot analysis to determine the level of FABP3 protein expression in the GM Fig. 2A . In mice that had been fed the standard chow diet , the steady-state levels of the FABP3 protein in the GM were significantly higher in UCP1-KO mice than in WT mice 2.3-and 2.8-fold higher in 3-and 11-month-old mice , respec-tively . In mice that had been fed the HF diet , the levels of FABP3 protein in the GM increased signifi-cantly in both genotypes in comparison with the levels in mice that had been fed a standard chow diet at 11 months of age 3.1-and 1.7-fold higher in WT and UCP1-KO mice , respectively . The augmented expression in the GM of middle-aged mice further increased in older mice that had been fed the HF diet in both genotypes , and the level of FABP3 protein in the GM was approximately eightfold higher than young WT mice that had been fed a standard chow diet . We then carried out regression analysis using the data from Fig. 2A , in which the data from WT and UCP1-KO mice were mixed because similar correla-tions were observed between the level of FABP3 protein and parameters in each group . The level of FABP3 protein in the GM significantly correlated level unit FABP3 0 unit level FABP3 0 0.6 level unit FABP3 0 with the BW Fig. 2B , tissue hypertrophy such as abdominal white adipose tissues , heart or liver , and the increase in serum insulin level data not shown . unit 10 We further examined genetically obese and diabetic mice to determine whether or not the increase in FABP3 expression in the GM is a general phenome-non in the obese state . As shown in Fig. S1A , B Supporting Information , the levels of FABP3 pro-tein in the GM were significantly higher in ob ? ob and db ? db mice 2.5-and 2.7-fold , respectively than control WT mice however , there was no difference in the levels in the heart of control and obese or dia-betic mice . These results strongly suggested a close relationship between FABP3 expression in the skeletal muscle and the progression of obesity and insulin resistance . Effects of FABP3 induction on transcriptional regulation and glucose uptake in C2C12 myotubes Several FABPs have been reported to mediate gene transcription by carrying the ligands for nuclear receptors , such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors PPARs . To determine whether or not an increased FABP3 level affects gene expression related to energy metabolism in skeletal muscles , we carried out in vitro experiments using adenovirus expression vector . As shown in Fig. 3A , infection with adeno-viruses encoding human FABP3 cDNA increased the protein level in Hela cells in a multiplicity of amount % 100 mRNA Relative 50 of infection MOI -dependent manner . Similarly , C2C12 myotubes infected with FABP3 adenoviruses expressed exogenous human FABP3 and the protein level was approximately 10-fold higher than the mouse FABP3 level originally expressed in the cells , as shown in Fig. 5 . However , the increase in the FABP3 level did not affect gene expression of acyl-CoA oxidase ACO , carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 CPT1 , phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase PEP-CK , glucose transporter 4 GLUT4 and uncoupling protein 3 UCP3 in the myotubes Fig. 3B . We also did not detect any changes in the mRNA levels of PPARa , PPARc and PPARd , as well as the mRNA level of endogenous mouse FABP3 data not shown . Moreover , cotreatment of the FABP3 cells with ligands for PPARs failed to increase the mRNA level of CPT1 data not shown . We next examined whether or not FABP3 induc-tion affected glucose uptake in skeletal muscle cells . In the absence of insulin stimulation , the uptake of 2-deoxy-D-glucose 2-DG significantly increased 1.3-fold of the control in human FABP3-induced C2C12 myotubes compared to the LacZ control cells Fig. 4 . As expected , insulin enhanced 2-DG uptake in the myotubes , but the uptake was significantly higher in the FABP3-induced cells than the control cells 1.3-fold , indicating that FABP3 induction pAMPK pAS160 Tubulin ratio FABP3 ratio 3 unit unit 2 Arbitrary Arbitrary 1 1 enhanced the basal level of glucose uptake in the skele-tal muscle cells . Effects of FABP3 induction on signal transduction in C2C12 myotubes We investigated the effects of FABP3 induction on signal transduction regulating energy metabolism in the skeletal muscle cells . We first examined the effect of FABP3 on AMPK phosphorylation in C2C12 myotubes . As shown in Fig. 5 , the induction of FABP3 tended to increase the phosphorylation of AMPK in C2C12 myotubes without insulin stimula-tion , whereas the phosphorylation levels were similar between the FABP3-induced cells and the LacZ cells in the presence of insulin stimulation . We then exam-ined the phosphorylation of Akt substrate protein AS160 in the myotubes because this molecule is phosphorylated by AMPK and stimulates glucose pAMPK pAS160 AS160 ratio unit ratio 1.5 uptake in muscle Sakamoto Holman 2008 . It was found that the phosphorylation level of AS160 was higher in the FABP3-induced cells than in the con-trol cells independent of insulin stimulation . To make sure that FABP3-induced AS160 phosphorylation is owing to AMPK activation , we checked the effect of AMPK inhibition on AS160 phosphorylation in C2C12 myotubes . As expected , the increased phos-phorylation of AMPK in the FABP3-induced cells was reduced markedly by compound C , an AMPK inhibitor Fig. 6 . The phosphorylation of AS160 was also significantly reduced in the cells , but its inhibi-tion was limited to approximately 50 % of the level without the drug . Glucose uptake and signal transduction in C2C12 myotubes in the presence of palmitate We examined the effects of FABP3 induction on glu-cose uptake and signal transduction in C2C12 myotu-bes in the presence of a saturated fatty acid palmitate because circulating levels of non-esterified FAs are chronically increased in the obese state , which causes insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes Boden 2008 . The enhancement of glucose uptake observed in the FABP3-induced cells without insulin stimulation in the absence of palmitate was suppressed in the pres-ence of palmitate , whereas insulin stimulated 2-DG uptake in the myotubes Fig. 7 . Similar to the absence of palimitate , as shown in Fig. 4 , glucose uptake was significantly higher in the FABP3-induced cells than in the control cells 1.2-fold . We then determined the phosphorylation levels of AMPK and AS160 in the myotubes . As shown in Fig. 8 , FABP3 induction increased AMPK phosphor-ylation in the C2C12 myotubes in the presence of palmitate , independent of insulin stimulation . There was no difference in the phosphorylation level of AS160 between the FABP3-induced cells and the LacZ cells without insulin stimulation , whereas the phosphorylation level tended to be higher in the unit unit 1 1 Arbitrary Arbitrary FABP3 cells than in the control cells with insulin stimulation , and correlated to the difference in the 2-DG uptake in each condition . Moreover , we examined the effect of FABP3 on the phosphoryla-tion of Akt , which also plays important roles in insu-lin signaling and glucose uptake via activation of AS160 in the skeletal muscle Sakamoto Holman 2008 . Insulin greatly stimulated the phosphorylation of Akt Ser473 , a regulatory site for Akt activity Woodgett 2005 , in the control and FABP3-induced cells Fig. 9 . Although the insulin-stimulated Akt phosphorylation in the myotubes was considerably inhibited by palmitate , its inhibitory effect was blocked in the FABP3-induced cells P 0.01 vs. control cells . There were no differences in the phos-phorylation levels of extracellular signal-regulated kinase ? mitogen-activated protein kinase ERK ? MAPK between the FABP3-induced and LacZ cells in each condition Fig. 9 . pAkt Akt pERK ERK Tubulin ratio 10 unit 6 ratio FABP3 3 unit 2 Discussion We first determined the level of FABP3 expression in UCP1-KO mice , which become obese when fed a HF diet Kontani et al. 2005 . UCP1 is a BAT-spe-cific mitochondrial protein , which dissipates the chemical energy produced by the oxidative phosphor-ylation of energy fuels , such as FAs and glucose Kozak Harper 2000 . Recent studies have reported an impact of BAT and UCP1 on the development of obesity in humans Celi 2009 . We have also showed that FABP3 is induced in response to increased demand for adaptive thermogenesis in the BAT of rodents Yamashita et al. 2008 , whereas FABP3 expression in the skeletal muscle and heart was not determined in the previous study . In the present study , significant correlations were detected among the three tissues in both WT and UCP1-KO mice . In particular , a strong correlation was observed between the level of FABP3 mRNA in the GM and increase in BW in both genotypes . These findings indicate that FABP3 expression increases considerably as obesity develops in mice despite the absence of UCP1 . Nevertheless , the mode of FABP3 mRNA induction in BAT and heart ? GM was different between UCP1-KO and WT mice . Namely , the level of FABP3 mRNA in BAT was consistently higher in UCP1-KO mice than in WT mice , whereas the levels in heart and GM tended to be lower in UCP1-KO mice than in WT mice with the increase in BW . Because FABP3 is a cold-inducible gene in BAT Yamashita et al. 2008 , its increased expression in UCP1-KO mice appears to reflect on their cold-sensitive phenotype compared to WT mice . However , because FA is not effectively oxi-dized in UCP1-deficient BAT , the energy substrate is deposited as the form of triglyceride , resulting in a marked hypertrophy of BAT in UCP1-KO mice Kontani et al. 2005 . So , this specific fat accumula-tion in BAT might act to lower the induction of FABP3 and over supply of FA to heart and GM in the mutant mice compared to WT mice especially in obese state . Likewise , the increased amount of FABP3 in GM of KO mice fed the chow diet may suggest a great demand for cold-induced thermogenesis , because skeletal muscle is an important organ for adaptive thermogenesis like BAT . The increased FABP3 content in the GM of mice with diet-induced obesity was confirmed by protein analysis this is similar to the change in the FABP3 content in the BAT Yamashita et al. 2008 and is consistent with the findings of Shearer et al. 2005 . Significant increases in the level of FABP3 protein were also observed in the GM of genetically obese ob ? ob and diabetic db ? db mice . The increase in the FABP3 content in the GM suggests an augmenta-tion in the ability to uptake FAs in the muscle with the development of obesity because FABP3 induction in cultured cells enhances palmitate influx Yamashita et al. 2008 . Regression analyses also showed a strong correlation between the FABP3 content in the GM and various obesity phenotypes , such as the progress of cardiac and hepatic hypertrophy and the increase in serum insulin level . Because FABP binds several ligands for PPARs , as well as long-chain FAs , and carries them to the nucleus Furuhashi Hotamisligil 2008 , the increase in FABP3 expression in the GM may not only enhance FA uptake , but also stimulate the transcription of genes related to FA oxidation , which could prevent the progress of lipotoxicity in obesity , where circulating levels of FAs remain chron-ically increased Roden 2004 . To examine the effect of FABP3 expression on the transcription of genes related to energy metabolism in skeletal muscle cells , we performed in vitro experi-ments using adenovirus expression vector encoding human FABP3 and C2C12 myotubes . In our experi-mental setup , however , a simple induction of FABP3 did not affect the expression of genes involved in glu-cose and FA metabolism in the myotubes , suggesting that the role of FABP3 in gene transcription may be secondary . Nevertheless , we found that FABP3 induction enhanced the basal level of glucose uptake in the skeletal muscle cells . In this context , the increased expression of FABP3 in the skeletal muscles observed in our obese and ? or diabetic mouse models appears to be a defensive response against lipotoxicity and high glucose levels associated with their pathol-ogy . Although the mode of interaction between FABP3 and lipid ligands and their localization in the muscle cells remain to be addressed , these results led us to examine the effect of FABP3 induction on the activities of signaling molecules related to glucose metabolism in skeletal muscle . AMPK is the downstream component of a kinase cascade that acts as an energy sensor controlling glu-cose and lipid metabolism Kahn et al. 2005 Hardie 2007 Osler Zierath 2008 . Previous studies have showed that AMPK is activated in response to a vari-ety of stimuli , including metabolic stress that inhibits ATP production , such as hypoxia and glucose depri-vation Mu et al. 2001 , those that increase ATP con-sumption , like exercise Winder Hardie 1996 , and adipokines , such as leptin Minokoshi et al. 2002 and adiponectin Yamauchi et al. 2002 . AMPK phospho-rylates and activates AS160 , which have recently emerged as an important regulator of GLUT4 traffic Hardie 2007 Sakamoto Holman 2008 . In the present study , we showed that FABP3 can stimulate AMPK phosphorylation and increase glucose uptake in C2C12 myotubes , although this ability of FABP3 appears to be affected by FAs and insulin . Specifically , induction of FABP3 stimulated AMPK phosphoryla-tion and insulin-independent glucose uptake in the C2C12 myotubes , whereas the uptake was inhibited in the presence of a high dose 1000 lM of palmitate in spite of AMPK activation . Similar results were observed in a previous report in which increasing FA availability increased AMPK activity independent of changes in the cellular energy charge in L6 myotubes Watt et al. 2006 . Watt et al. 2006 also suggested that FAs may modulate AMPK allosterically , making it a better substrate for the upstream kinase , LKB1 . Likewise , there may be an involvement of uniden-tified kinase to activate AS160 in the absence of FA , because the increased phosphorylation of AS160 was not fully reduced by an AMPK inhibitor in the FABP3-induced cells without insulin stimulation . In the cells , Akt activity also appeared to be very low , although Akt is a key molecule that transduces insulin action to control glucose transport in the adipose tissue and skeletal muscle Farese et al. 2005 . The existence of the unknown kinase is also suggested by the results that AS160 phosphorylation was signifi-cantly higher in the FABP3-induced cells than in the control cells in spite of similar phosphorylation levels of AMPK Fig. 5 and Akt Fig. 9 in the presence of insulin . On the contrary , the unknown kinase could be inactive in the presence of palmitate , because AS160 phosphorylation Fig. 8 and glucose uptake Fig. 7 in C2C12 myotubes without insulin stimula-tion were not stimulated by FABP3 induction in spite of the increased AMPK phosphorylation Fig. 8 . We presently do not know the mechanism that the increased AMPK signaling was not transmitted prop-erly to AS160 in the myotubes in the presence of FA . Further study would be required to clarify this mech-anism and the unknown kinase in the future . Although the insulin-independent AS160 phosphor-ylation and glucose uptake in FABP3-induced C2C12 myotubes were inhibited in the presence of palmitate , insulin stimulation restored the effects of FABP3 induction for AS160 phosphorylation and glucose uptake in the cells . This may be explained by a contri-bution of insulin-stimulated Akt activation as was observed in Fig. 9 , in which its phosphorylation level was maintained in the FABP3-induced C2C12 cells but not in the control cells . This result suggested that FABP3 improved the palmitate-induced insulin resis-tance , at least in the level of Akt phosphorylation in the myotubes . FABP3 may also contribute to AS160 phos-phorylation by maintaining insulin-dependent Akt activation in the cells under a lipotoxic condition . Taken together , it is plausible that FABP3 acts to stimulate AMPK activation and ? or insulin-dependent Akt activation by increasing FA utilization in skeletal muscle , which facilitates AS160 phosphorylation and increases glucose uptake . Considering the fact that AMPK activation increased both Akt phosphorylation and glucose uptake in insulin-resistant cardiomyocytes Bertrand et al. 2006 , AMPK and Akt signaling may affect one another to regulate AS160 activity in skeletal muscle . Nevertheless , there must be a limitation to the stimulation of glucose oxidation in muscle with excess fat accumulation . Indeed , in obesity and diabetes , insu-lin-stimulated glucose transport , such as the transloca-tion of GLUT4 to the plasma membrane , is impaired in muscles with excess fat accumulation Farese et al. 2005 . The molecular mechanism by which excess FAs interfere with glucose uptake , including AS160 signal-ing and translocation of GLUTs in skeletal muscle , remains to be elucidated . Thus , this study showed an intimate relationship between FABP3 expression in skeletal muscle and the development of obesity and ? or insulin resistance in mice . In addition , in vitro experiments indicated that an increase in FABP3 expression stimulates AS160 phosphorylation and glucose uptake via AMPK acti-vation and insulin-dependent Akt activation in the skeletal muscle cells . These responses contribute to improving the hyperglycemic state in obesity how-ever , a marked increase in muscle FABP3 without an adequate insulin action and a coordinated increase in oxidative capacity may result in fat deposition and eventually lead to insulin resistance . Experimental procedures Animals UCP1-knockout KO mice provided by Dr Leslie Kozak , Pennington Biomedical Research Center and WT mice were reared at 23 ? C under artificial lighting for 12 h ? day .

21540074	Hematopoietic stem cells HSCs are primitive cells capable of both self-renewal and differentiating into all of the mature blood cell lineages . The capacity to self-renew is an essential feature of all stem cells , generating at least Supplementary data associated with this article can be found in the online version at doi 10.1016 j.exphem.2011.03.008 . one daughter cell that has stem cell properties similar to the parental cell . Thus , the ability to self-renew is critical to maintaining the HSC pool size , and thereby keeps a supply of mature blood cells throughout the lifetime of organisms . The self-renewal process is regulated by both intrinsic and extrinsic signals [ 1–3 ] . Although great prog-ress has been made in identifying the many signaling pathways and transcription factors involved in HSC regula-tion , recent findings also uncovered epigenetic machinery , such as polycomb-group PcG protein , as a major regulator of HSCs [ 4,5 ] . Post-translational covalent modifications of histone N-terminal tails include methylation , acetylation , ubiquity-lation , sumoylation , and phosphorylation , and are central to the epigenetic regulation of transcription , replication , and repair [ 6 ] . Histone acetylation marks are generally associ-ated with transcriptional activation , whereas histone meth-ylation marks contribute to transcriptional activation or repression , depending on the types and sites of modified residues and degree of methylation . For example , trimethy-lation of histone H3 at lysine 4 H3K4me3 , lysine 36 H3K36me3 , and lysine 79 H3K79me3 is closely associ-ated with transcriptional activation , whereas trimethylation of H3 at lysine 9 H3K9me3 , H3 at lysine 27 H3K27me3 , and H4 at lysine 20 H4K20me3 is linked to transcriptional repression . The role of histone methyla-tion marks in stem cells is best known for embryonic stem cells . Comprehensive genome-wide analyses have demonstrated that embryonic stem cells establish ‘‘bivalent domains’’ that contain coexisting active H3K4me3 and repressive H3K27me3 histone methylation marks at promoters of developmental regulator genes to keep these genes ‘‘poised’’ for activation in embryonic stem cells . Upon differentiation , promoters with bivalent domains are resolved into a monovalent state , either active or repressive [ 7 ] . Recent findings have revealed that bivalent domains also exist in HSCs [ 8,9 ] . Actually , our recent analysis showed that the B-cell lineage regulator genes are transcrip-tionally repressed by bivalent domains before lineage commitment in HSCs [ 10 ] . Specific patterns of histone methylation marks at promoters of target genes thus play a key role in cell fate decision . Although the methylation of histones has traditionally been considered a static modification , the identification of a large number of histone demethylases strongly suggests a dynamic nature of histone methylation . Histone demethy-lases are divided into two families . The first to be described was the amine oxidase family , lysine-specific demethylase 1 LSD1 , a demethylase specific to H3K4me2 me1 [ 11 ] . Thereafter , jumonji C JmjC domain-containing proteins were identified [ 12 ] . The majority of histone demethylases belong to the JmjC domain-containing family . Histone demethylases have been implicated in diverse cellular func-tions through the regulation of gene expression [ 13,14 ] . In adults , jumonji domain containing 3 , a H3K27me2 3-specific demethylase , and LSD1 play a crucial role in differentiation of neural and epidermal stem cells [ 15,16 ] and proliferation of neural stem cells [ 17 ] , respectively . However , it is unknown how histone demethylases function in the maintenance of self-renewing HSCs . F-box and leucine-rich repeat protein 10 Fbxl10 , also known as Jhdm1b or Kdm2b , belong to the JmjC domain-containing histone demethylases , and contain an N-terminal JmjC domain , a CXXC zinc finger domain , a PHD finger , an F-box , and eight leucine-rich repeats [ 12,18,19 ] . Fbxl10 demethylates H3K36me2 and H3K36me1 , but not H3K36me3 [ 12,20,21 ] . The effect of Fbxl10 in cultured cells remains controversial . Fbxl10 promotes cell prolifera-tion and functions as a physiological inhibitor of senes-cence in mouse embryonic fibroblasts MEFs [ 20–22 ] , but overexpression of Fbxl10 inhibits the proliferation of HeLa cells [ 19,23 ] . Furthermore , the roles of Fbxl10 in the context of whole organisms have not been characterized . Studies in Drosophila have demonstrated that dKDM2 a homolog of the mammalian FBXL10 forms a multiprotein complex called dRAF dRing-associated factors , which contains dRing a homolog of the mammalian RING proteins and Psc a homolog of the mammalian BMI1 protein [ 24 ] . dKDM2 enhances homeotic gene silencing by PcG complexes , suggesting that the dRAF and poly-comb repressive complex PRC 1 cooperate in vivo . dKDM2 also stimulates mono-ubiquitylation of histone H2A H2Aub1 by dRing and Psc in a manner independent of dKDM2 catalytic activity [ 24 ] . Thus , the dRAF complex can coordinate the removal of an active mark , H3K36me2 , with addition of a repressive mark , H2Aub1 , although neither of these two activities appears to depend on the other . In mammals , Fbxl10 is included in the BCOR BCL6 corepressor complex , which also contains Ring1A B , Bmi1 , and or nervous system polycomb 1 Nspc1 a paralog of Bmi1 [ 25,26 ] . Ring1A B and Bmi1 are core components of PRC1 and play a crucial role in the maintenance of HSCs . All of these findings suggest functional crosstalk between Fbxl10 and PRC1 proteins in HSCs . To explore the relevance of histone demethylases in HSCs , we profiled their gene expression and found that Fbxl10 is highly expressed in HSCs . In the present study , we investigated the role of Fbxl10 in HSCs by conducting a gain-of-function analysis and demonstrated a novel function in maintaining the self-renewal capacity of HSCs .

For chromatin immunoprecipitation ChIP assays , mouse Fbxl10 cDNA tagged with a 3 Flag in the retroviral vector pGCDNsam was used . A recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein pseudotyped high-titer retrovirus was generated by a 293gpg pack-aging cell line [ 28 ] . The virus in supernatants of 293gpg cells was concentrated by centrifugation at 6000g for 16 hours . Transduction of CD34 KSL HSCs CD34 KSL HSCs were transduced with the indicated retrovirus as described previously , with minor modifications [ 29 ] . CD34 KSL HSCs were sorted into 96-well microtiter plates coated with the recombinant human fibronectin fragment CH-296 RetroNectin Takara Shuzo , Otsu , Japan at 100 cells per well and incubated in a-minimal essential medium supplemented with 1 % fetal bovine serum , 1 % L-glutamine , penicillin , streptomycin solution GPS Sigma , St Louis , MO , USA , 50 mM 2-mercaptoethanol , 100 ng mL mouse stem cell factor SCF PeproTech , Rocky Hill , NJ , USA , and 100 ng mL human thrombopoietin TPO Pe-proTech for 24 hours . Then , cells were transduced with the indi-cated retrovirus at a multiplicity of infection of 1500 in the presence of 1 mg mL RetroNectin and 10 mg mL protamine sulfate Sigma for 24 hours . After transduction , cells were further incu-bated in S-Clone SF-O3 Sanko Junyaku , Tokyo , Japan supple-mented with 0.1 % bovine serum albumin , 50 mM 2-mercaptoethanol , 1 % GPS , 50 ng mL SCF , and 50 ng mL TPO and subjected to assays . CD34 ? KSL progenitor cells were trans-duced and cultured similarly , with the exception that 100 ng mL chimeric protein of soluble IL-6 receptor a and IL-6 FP6 kindly provided by Kyowa Hakko Kirin , Tokyo , Japan was added . Colony-forming assay Colony assays were performed in methylcellulose-containing Iscove’s modified Dulbecco’s medium Methocult M3234 Stem-cell Technologies , Vancouver , BC , Canada supplemented with 20 ng mL mouse SCF , 20 ng mL mouse IL-3 , 20 ng mL human TPO , and 2 U mL human erythropoietin , and incubated at 37 C in a 5 % CO2 atmosphere , as described previously [ 29–31 ] . The number of high proliferative potential HPP -and low proliferative potential colony-forming cells CFCs , which generate a colony with a diameter O1 mm and 1 mm , respectively , were evaluated by counting colonies at day 14 of culture . Because colonies with multilineage differentiation potential colony-forming units-nmEM [ CFU-nmEM ] are mainly derived from HPP-CFCs [ 32 ] , GFP ? colonies derived from HPP-CFCs were individually collected , cytospun onto glass slides , and subjected to May-Gruenwald € Giemsa staining for morphological examination .

Results Histone methylation status is dynamically regulated by histonemethyltransferases and histonedemethylases . Histone methyltransferases , including MLL and EZH2 , have been studied extensively on their role in HSCs [ 33,34 ] , but little is known about histone demethylases . To understand the role of histone demethylases in HSCs , we first compared the gene expression profiles of 26 histone demethylases invarious hematopoietic cell fractions of BM by microarray analysis . We focused on CD34 KSL HSCs , which comprise only 0.004 % of mouse BM mononuclear cells [ 35 ] in comparison with terminally differentiated blood cell lineages . The micro-array analysis identified three unique genes Fbxl10 , Jmjd1b , and LSD1 that were preferentially expressed in primitive hematopoietic populations , including CD34 KSL HSCs , CD34 ? KSL multipotent progenitors MPPs , and Lin cells Fig. 1A . Among these genes , Fbxl10 showed the greatest expression in CD34 KSL HSCs , but was markedly downre-gulated in terminally differentiated cells . We then examined basal expression levels of Fbxl10 in various BM hematopoi-etic cell populations by quantitative real-time PCR Fig. 1B . Consistent with the microarray data , the level of Fbxl10 expression was high in CD34 KSL HSCs and CD34 ? KSL MPPs . Among myeloid progenitors , the expres-sion of Fbxl10 was downregulated during the differentiation of common myeloid progenitors into granulocyte-macrophage progenitors and megakaryocyte-erythroid progenitors . Levels of Fbxl10 expression were very low in mature myeloid cells and erythroblasts compared to in CD34 KSL HSCs . These results demonstrate that Fbxl10 is preferentially expressed in primitive hematopoietic cells and downregulated along with differentiation . The expression profile suggested a role for Fbxl10 in the epigenetic regulation of HSCs . To clarify whether Fbxl10 has an effect on HSCs , we next overexpressed Fbxl10 in CD34 KSL HSCs using a retro-virus system Fig. 2A . CD34 KSL HSCs were transduced with empty control or Fbxl10 and then incubated for 13 days 14 days culture in total in the presence of SCF and TPO , the cytokine combination that supports proliferation of HSCs and progenitors rather than their differentiation . In all experiments , transduction efficiency was determined by flow cytometry using GFP as a marker antigen and ranged from 80 % to 90 % in the control and 60 % to 75 % in the Fbxl10-transduced cells Supplementary Figure E1 online only , available at www.exphem.org . Forced expres-sion of Fbxl10 gave no apparent growth advantage to cells and no morphological change was observed under the microscope compared to the control Fig. 2B , C . Nonethe-less , flow cytometric analyses of GFP ? transduced cells at day 14 of culture revealed a twofold increase in the propor-tion of KSL cells in the Fbxl10 culture compared to the control culture control , 0.98 % 6 0.10 % vs. Fbxl10 , 1.93 % 6 0.53 % p 0.05 , although an increase in the proportion of Lin cells in the Fbxl10 culture was not statistically significant control , 20.46 % 6 5.16 % vs. Fbxl10 , 27.52 6 4.32 % p 5 0.11 Fig. 2D . In addition , the proportion of myeloid progenitors c-Kit ? Sca-1 Lin within GFP ? cells was also significantly higher in Fbxl10-transduced cells control , 1.99 % 6 1.15 % vs. Fbxl10 , 6.41 % 6 2.28 % p 0.01 . Next , the expansion of primitiveprogenitor cells was eval-uated by colony assay . The total number of CFCs derived A KSL KSL - from Fbxl10-transduced CD34 KSL HSCs was slightly increased in the 3.5-day culture compared to the control p 5 0.07 , but increased up to twofold in the 10-day culture p 0.01 Fig. 3A . Among CFCs , the number of HPP-CFCs , which generate a colony with a diameter O1 mm , was markedly increased with Fbxl10 compared to the control p 0.01 . Morphological evaluation of the colonies derived from HPP-CFCs revealed that the control and Fbxl10 cultures retained comparable numbers of CFU-nmEM with the potential for differentiation into multiple myeloid lineages at day 3.5 of culture p 5 0.07 at c2 test , while after 10-day culture , the Fbxl10 culture retained more CFU-nmEM than the control culture p 0.01 at c2 test Fig. 3B . Given that 60 % of freshly isolated CD34 KSL HSCs can be defined as CFU-nmEM , as described previously [ 29 ] , the net expansion of CFU-nmEM numbers in the Fbxl10 cultures was 50.7-to 65.9-fold at day 10 of culture , whereas that in the control cultures was 2.2-to 9.9-fold Fig. 3C , indicating a significant expansion of CFU-nmEM on forced expression of Fbxl10 . We further asked whether Fbxl10 could augment the colony-forming capacity of CD34 ? KSL MPPs . We transduced Fbxl10 into CD34 ? KSL MPPs and carried out colony-forming assays . Unexpectedly , Fbxl10 did not increase the number of CFCs or CFU-nmEM in the 3.5-day culture Supplementary Figure E2 online only , available at www.exphem.org and neither control nor Fbxl10-transduced CD34 ? KSL MPPs gave rise to HPP-CFCs in the 10-day culture data not shown . These results indicated that forced expression of Fbxl10 acts mainly in self-renewing CD34 KSL HSCs . B expression 2.0 1.5 Collectively , increased numbers of CFCs with multilineage differentiation potential , together with the higher proportion of KSL cells , suggested that forced expression of Fbxl10 better maintains primitive hematopoietic cells . A number of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors CKIs have been implicated in modulating the self-renewal potential of HSCs [ 36–38 ] . Fbxl10 regulates the proliferation and senes-cence of MEFs through repression of p15Ink4b , p16Ink4a , and p19Arf [ 20,21 ] . Moreover , purification of the Fbxl10 complex from murine erythroleukemia cells revealed that Fbxl10 coexists with components of PRC1 [ 25 ] , Ring1b and Bmi1 , which maintain HSC self-renewal through repression of p16Ink4a and p19Arf [ 29,30,39 ] . To determine whether forced expression of Fbxl10 also affects expression of the CKI genes in HSCs , we performed a quantitative real-time PCR analysis on GFP ? KSL cells purified from 14-day cultures of CD34 KSL HSCs . The level of Fbxl10 expres-sion was 8.0-fold higher in the Fbxl10-overexpressing cells than the control Fig. 4A . As expected from the findings in MEFs , forced expression of Fbxl10 significantly repressed the expression of p15Ink4b , p16Ink4a , p18Ink4c , and p57Kip2 Fig. 4B . We observed a mild but significant increase in p21Cip1 Waf1 expression on forced expression of Fbxl10 , but expression of p27Kip1 was not altered . These results demonstrated that Fbxl10 is a potent negative regulator of the expression of CKI genes , such as Ink4 p15Ink4b , p16 Ink4a , and p18 Ink4c and Cip Kip p57Kip2 in HSCs . Recruitment of Fbxl10 to the Ink4b-Arf-Ink4a and Ink4c locus Fbxl10 is a demethylase specific to H3K36me2 . H3K36 methylation is associated with active regions of chromatin and is also targeted not only to the gene promoters but gene bodies through the RNA polymerase II elongation . We thus analyzed the global levels of H3K36me2 in GFP ? Lin c-Kit ? stem progenitor cells purified from cultured CD34 KSL HSCs transduced with Fbxl10 . To obtain enough cells , we cultured transduced cells for 14 days in the presence of SCF and TPO and then purified GFP ? Lin c-Kit ? stem progenitor cells by cell sorting . As expected , the level of global H3K36me2 was decreased by 60 % in Fbxl10-overexpressing stem progenitor cells , while levels of H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 were not significantly altered Fig. 5A , indicating that Fbxl10 regulates the transcription of CKI genes through demethylation at H3K36me2 . To determine whether Fbxl10 directly regulates these CKI genes , we carried out ChIP assays on the binding of Fbxl10 to their promoter and gene body regions in GFP ? Lin c-Kit ? stem progenitor cells purified from cultured CD34 KSL HSCs transduced with Fbxl10 Fig. 5B . Because none of the available anti-Fbxl10 anti-bodies worked in ChIP assays in our hands , we retrovirally expressed 3 Flag-Fbxl10 in CD34 KSL HSCs . As ex-pected , ChIP assays using an anti-Flag antibody revealed the direct binding of Fbxl10 to the p15Ink4b , p19Arf , p16Ink4a , and p18Ink4c promoters and gene bodies , but not to the p57Kip2 promoter Fig. 5C , and a moderate but signif-icant decrease in H3K36me2 levels at the CKI gene promoters and gene bodies on forced expression of Fbxl10 Fig. 5D . Corresponding to the report on Drosophila KDM2 [ 24 ] , ChIP assays also detected a moderate but significant increase in levels of H2Aub1 at CKI gene promoters and gene bodies on forced expression of Fbxl10 Fig. 5E . These results defined p16Ink4a , p15Ink4b , and p18Ink4c as direct targets of Fbxl10 and suggested that Fbxl10 regulates the expression of these genes through de-methylation of H3K36 and mono-ubiquitylation of H2A . C 104 103 102 101 Forced expression of Fbxl10 prevents exhaustion of the long-term repopulating potential of HSCs following serial transplantation We next asked whether Fbxl10 has a positive effect on HSCs in vivo . Because the effect of forced expression of Fbxl10 on CFCs was evident after day 10 in culture , we performed competitive repopulation assays using 10-day A B cultured cells corresponding to 30 initial CD34 KSL HSCs from CD45.2 mice and 2 105 BM competitor cells from CD45.1 mice Fig. 6A . Unexpectedly , given the results in vitro , the flow cytometric analysis of peripheral blood revealed no obvious difference in the chimerism of donor-derived cells between the control and Fbxl10-transduced cells at 12 weeks after primary transplantation C 25000 cells % 80 types 60 Day 3.5 Day 10 A B ** Control expression expression 8 Fbxl10 mRNA mRNA 1.0 4 Fig. 6B . The Fbxl10-transduced cells displayed repopula-tion kinetics and lineage contribution similar to those of the control Supplementary Figure E3 online only , available at www.exphem.org . Because the 10-day ex vivo culture included quite a few hematopoietic progenitors , which could contribute to the short-term but multilineage repopu-lation in primary recipients , we evaluated the long-term re-populating ability , which is essential for evaluation of the self-renewal potential of HSCs , by serial transplantation Fig. 6A . At 12 weeks after the secondary transplantation , the percentage of donor-derived cells was slightly higher in recipients that received Fbxl10-transduced HSCs compared with those that received control HSCs , although the differ-ence in total chimerism was not significant p 5 0.21 . Finally , in the tertiary transplantation , Fbxl10-transduced HSCs still retained high repopulating capacity with the multilineage differentiation potential , while the control HSCs barely repopulated hematopoiesis and five recipients of control cells died before the analysis , probably due to infection because of the poor engraftment Fig. 6B D , clearly indicating that forced expression of Fbxl10 in CD34 KSL HSCs prevents exhaustion of the long-term repopulating potential of HSCs following serial transplantation . To understand the role of Fbxl10 in the transcriptional repression of the CKI genes during transplantation , we collected donor-derived KSL cells from the primary recip-ients at 12 weeks after transplantation . Quantitative real-time PCR analyses revealed that forced expression of Fbxl10 repressed the transcriptional activation of p15Ink4b and p16Ink4a , while both genes were upregulated in the control as in 14-day cultures of CD34 KSL HSCs Fig. 6E . Discussion Emerging evidence supports that epigenetic regulation is critical to the establishment of gene expression profiles specific to stem cells . Among histone-modifying enzymes , however , histone demethylases are relatively newly identi-fied . Thus , no demethylases have been implicated in the regulation of HSC function . In this paper , we provided the first evidence that a histone demethylase is involved in maintaining the self-renewal capacity of HSCs . Fbxl10 was preferentially expressed in hematopoietic stem progenitor cells . Forced expression of Fbxl10 in HSCs expanded multipotent stem progenitor cells ex vivo and maintained the long-term repopulating capacity of HSCs during serial transplantation . Of note , the effects of overexpressed Fbxl10 were reminiscent of those of PcG genes , such as Ezh2 and Bmi1 . Overexpression of Ezh2 , which encodes a core component of PRC2 , reportedly prevents exhaustion of the long-term repopulating potential of HSCs during serial transplantation [ 31 ] . In addition , we previously demonstrated that forced expression of Bmi1 in HSCs expands multipotent stem progenitor cells during culture ex vivo [ 29 ] . These findings strongly suggest cross-talk between Fbxl10 and the PcG proteins in HSCs . As described here , studies of the Fbxl10 complexes in both Drosophila and mammalian cells have revealed that Fbxl10 coexists with Ring1b and Bmi1 , core components of PRC1 [ 24–26 ] . Although the complexes containing Fbxl10 have been characterized as distinct from PRC1 , forced expression of Fbxl10 enhanced mono-ubiquitylation of H2A at its target gene loci . These findings suggest that Fbxl10 regulates transcriptional repression through H3K36 demethylation as well as H2A ubiquitylation by sharing core components with A B Control Fbxl10 C * * * 4 Input * * D * * % * 5 E p19Arf p16Ink4a p18Ink4c Exon1 ?

Moreover , in both mouse and human fibroblasts , Fbxl10 upregulates the mRNA expression of Ezh2 [ 21 ] . In fact , expression of Ezh2 was upregulated on forced expression of Fbxl10 in donor-derived KSL cells from the primary recipients . Nonetheless , ChIP assays revealed that H3K27me3 status , which is mediated by Ezh2 , was not changed on Fbxl10 overexpression at the Ink4b-Arf-Ink4a locus as compared with the control , indicating that the effects of Fbxl10 on this locus are largely inde-pendent of PRC2 Supplementary Figure E4 online only , available at www.exphem.org . The self-renewal capacity of HSCs is maintained by close regulation of the cell-cycle machinery . In particular , CKIs play a key role in controlling the self-renewal of HSCs [ 36–38 ] and the PcG complexes transcriptionally repress the Ink4b-Arf-Ink4a locus . In Bmi1-deficient mice , expression of Ink4a and Arf was markedly increased in hematopoietic cells and enforced expression of Ink4a and Arf in HSCs caused cell-cycle arrest and p53-dependent apoptosis , respectively [ 29,39 ] . Conversely , the self-renewal capacity of Bmi1 HSCs was substantially restored by the deletion of both Ink4a and Arf [ 30 ] . Further-more , an increasing level of p16Ink4a was associated with aging of HSCs and loss of p16Ink4a ameliorated the physio-logical impact of aging on HSCs [ 40,41 ] . These findings define the Ink4a-Arf locus as a critical regulator for the maintenance of HSC self-renewal . In this study , the Ink4b-Arf-Ink4a genes appeared to be direct downstream targets of Fbxl10 in hematopoietic cells as part of them were noted in MEFs [ 20,21 ] , confirming again functional crosstalk between Fbxl10 and PcG proteins . Moreover , p18Ink4c was also demonstrated to be a direct target of Fbxl10 in hematopoietic cells by ChIP assays , suggesting that Fbxl10 targets a broad range of Ink4 family genes that could have similar impacts on HSC self-renewal . Taken together , the Ink4 family genes might be the major targets of Fbxl10 to prevent HSC exhaustion during ex vivo culture and serial transplantation . CKI genes exhibit different expression profiles between HSCs and hematopoietic progenitors [ 42 ] . It might be important to address the contribution of Fbxl10 to the cell type-specific regulation of CKI gene transcription . Nevertheless , additional targets other than Ink4 family genes might exist for Fbxl10 in HSCs . We will have to await comprehensive analyses of target genes to obtain an overall picture of its function . In this study , forced expression of Fbxl10 in CD34 KSL HSCs markedly expanded CFC numbers during a 10-day culture ex vivo . Nonetheless , expression of Fbxl10 in CD34 ? KSL MPPs did not enhance their colony-forming capacity , although Fbxl10 was highly expressed not only in CD34 KSL HSCs but also in CD34 ? KSL MPPs . These findings strongly indicate that Fbxl10 functions in an HSC-specific manner and promotes the production of highly potent stem progenitor cells . These findings are in line with those for p15Ink4b-deficient mice . Loss of p15Ink4b resulted in an increase in not only common myeloid progenitors , but also KSL cells that were not accompanied by the expansion of long-term reconstituting HSCs [ 43 ] . Thus , the increase in CFCs caused by Fbxl10 might be partially due to silencing of p15Ink4b . Although Fbxl10-transduced HSCs did not show any advantages in repopulat-ing capacity compared with the control in the primary transplantation , they retained a markedly greater repopulat-ing capacity during serial transplantation . Thus , forced expression of Fbxl10 maintains the self-renewal capacity of HSCs , probably by antagonizing various stresses that limit this capacity . This notion was supported by the finding that Fbxl10 repressed many of the CKI genes , which are often upregulated upon various stresses , to very low levels during transplantation . In a study using retroviral-insertional mutagenesis , Fbxl10 was identified as one of the common targets of provirus integration in molony murine leukemia virus induced rat T-cell lymphomas [ 22 ] . In fact , FBXL10 expression is upregulated in various human hema-tological malignancies , including acute myeloid and lymphoblastic leukemia , as well as in seminoma [ 21 ] . Furthermore , the INK4B-ARF-INK4A locus , a direct target of Fbxl10 , is commonly inactivated by homozygous dele-tion or hypermethylation of the promoter in various human hematological malignancies [ 44 ] . Although we did not observe the development of leukemia or lymphoma in recipient mice repopulated with the Fbxl10-overexpressing cells during serial transplantation , it is important to investi-gate whether the upregulation of Fbxl10 contributes to the development and maintenance of self-renewing leukemic stem cells . It will be also intriguing to analyze the collabo-ration of Fbxl10 and PcG proteins in the context of hema-tological malignancies . In conclusion , our study identified Fbxl10 , a demethylase acting on H3K36 , as a novel epigenetic regulator of HSCs , which plays an important role in maintaining the self-renewal capacity and or multipotency of HSCs . Together with accumulating evidence on the role of histone modifiers in HSCs , our findings underscore the dynamic regulation of histone modifications as a new field of HSC research .

21752956	RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS—This study evaluated 60 2331–2340 , 2011 Mtoxicanimal any models of diabetes depend on the administration of diabetogenic drugs such as streptozotocin STZ or alloxan . These are glucose analogs that target pancreatic b-cells via GLUT2 transporter uptake . Because of the simplicity and reproducibility of diabetes induction with STZ , a highly stable glucosamine-nitrosourea compound , it represents by far the most widely used model 1 . Indeed , among 131 analyzed articles published in 2010 on murine islet transplantation , 100 76.3 % used STZ to induce di-abetes , whereas 21 16 % were performed in models of spontaneous diabetes mostly NOD mice , 3 2.3 % in-volved alloxan , 5 3.8 % relied on transplanted islets in nondiabetic mice , and 2 1.5 % used alternative ways for diabetes induction . Whereas STZ is known to target b-cells via the transporter GLUT2 , it is not specific , since the kidney and liver are also susceptible to STZ toxicity 1 . Moreover , several groups have described immunomodify-ing effects of STZ both in vitro and in vivo , although the confounding impact of the induced hyperglycemia was not clearly distinguished 2–6 . Luo et al. 7 reported that hyperglycemia , potentially via an increased level of corti-costeroids , causes a rapid depletion in thymocytes and splenic T cells followed by homeostatic T-cell proliferation . However , the exact mechanisms leading to the observed immunosuppression after STZ administration , especially the effect on different lymphocyte subpopulations , including T regulatory cells Tregs , remain elusive . One of the major goals in islet transplantation Tx re-search is to find strategies to obviate the need for lifelong immunosuppression that is toxic to the b-cells and detri-mental to the host 8 . Indeed , using STZ-induced diabetes models , novel immunosuppressive and tolerance induction protocols for allogeneic as well as xenogeneic islet Tx have demonstrated long-term graft survival 9,10 . How-ever , many costimulation blockade–based Tx tolerance protocols that are successful in chemically induced di-abetic mice failed to produce long-term graft tolerance in NOD mice or in other Tx models such as skin Tx , with the latter being considered as one of the most stringent models . The underlying autoimmunity directed against b-cells , the mode of Tx , and the skin-specific antigen–presenting cells all have been put forward to explain the observed resistance to Tx tolerance 10,11 . Another possible explanation for these apparent differences is that immunosuppression related to STZ-induced diabetes could result in an overestimation of the efficacy of tolerance induction . Consistent with this notion , a protocol targeting costimulation that induced tolerance in STZ-induced diabetic recipients was unable to induce tolerance in nondiabetic recipients 7 . Thus , STZ and or the ensuing hyperglycemia seem to downregulate the adaptive immune response against islet grafts . In the past few years , Tregs were reported to play a key role in long-term islet graft tolerance 12–15 . However , none of these studies addressed the possible effect of STZ administration and the ensuing hyperglycemia on Tregs . Using a rat-to-mouse islet Tx model , we recently reported an increase of Tregs in lymphoid organs and within grafts of tolerant mice treated with rapamycin and anti-CD154 monoclonal antibody mAb , suggesting a critical role for Tregs in the induction phase of tolerance 9,16 . The aim of the current study was to analyze whether STZ-induced diabetes leads to changes in Treg numbers and function and whether this affects subsequent immune responses using models of islet and skin Tx . RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS n 3 n 3 TABLE 1 Blood repartition after STZ administration Becton Dickinson . Data were collected on a FACScanto Becton Dickinson . All data were analyzed using Flowjo software version 8.7.3 TreeStar , Inc. , Ashland , OR . In vitro proliferation and suppression assays . For proliferation assays , 0.2 3 106 splenocytes were stimulated with concanavalin A 3 mg mL , Transforming growth factor-b measurement . Plasma transforming growth RESULTS STZ-induced diabetic mice are lymphopenic . C57BL 6 mice became diabetic between 48 and 72 h after STZ injection 220 mg kg Fig. 1A and rapidly lost weight as a consequence of dehydration Fig. 1B . Total splenocyte counts were assessed on days 3 and 13 after STZ admin-istration , showing a rapid depletion Fig. 1C . The size of the spleen was also significantly diminished after 13 days Fig. 1D . Lymphoid organs revealed a similar reduction with respect to cell numbers and size data not shown . The profile of peripheral blood leukocytes was further examined using an automated hematocytometer Table 1 . The number of small WBCs corresponding to the lym-phocytes SCR was decreased as soon as 6 h after STZ administration , whereas the number of middle and large WBCs corresponding to monocytes MCR and gran-ulocytes LCR , respectively , remained stable over time . The same was true for erythrocytes and hemoglobin Table 1 . STZ is known to be hepatotoxic and nephrotoxic . Thus , a strong inflammatory response to STZ within these organs as well as in the pancreas , the peritoneum , or the heart could explain the observed lymphopenia . However , hematoxylin and eosin staining of these organs performed 3 days after STZ administration did not show any significant lymphocytic infiltration Supplementary Fig. 1 . In conclu-sion , STZ-induced diabetes led to a strong lymphopenia in the blood and in the spleen , which was not due to leukocyte redistribution and organ infiltration . We further assessed by flow cytometry the relative dis-tribution of the leukocyte subsets in circulation and in the spleen after STZ administration . Frequencies of CD3+ , CD4+ , Foxp3+CD25+ gated within the CD4+ cells , and CD8+ cells were determined according to their respective isotype controls Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. 2 . Interestingly , the percentage of Foxp3+CD25+ Tregs significantly increased in both compartments , at day 3 in the spleen and at day 7 in the blood , although total numbers did not differ from naive mice . Similar results were found in lymph nodes data not shown . Moreover , the proportion of CD8+ cells was di-minished in the blood but not in the spleen 3 days after STZ administration Fig. 2 , whereas the B-cell levels remained unchanged data not shown . Taken together , STZ-induced diabetes is associated with a higher frequency of Tregs in the blood and secondary lymphoid organs and reduced numbers of CD8+ T cells in the blood . Distinct effect of STZ and acute hyperglycemia on leukocytes . To understand the respective roles of STZ and acute hyperglycemia in the observed induction of lymphopenia and increase in Treg frequencies , three dif-ferent models were established . First , diabetic mice were transplanted with syngeneic islets under the kidney cap-sule 3 days after STZ , which reinstalled normoglycemia in these animals data not shown . After 60 days , the kidney bearing the islets was removed to induce diabetes without STZ . Total leukocyte number and Treg frequencies were measured in the blood at day 60 and day 60 + 3 , +7 , and +12 after nephrectomy Fig. 3A and B and in the spleen before nephrectomy day 60 and after nephrectomy day 60 + 13 Fig . 3C and D . Treg frequencies increased only after STZ administration , although both STZ and hyper-glycemia induced lymphopenia . Second , RIP-DTR trans-genic mice , which express the coding sequence of the DT receptor under the control of an insulin promoter , were made diabetic by DT administration 18 . Total leukocyte numbers were decreased in the blood Fig. 3E and in the spleen Fig. 3F , although the frequency of Tregs remained unaffected in both compartments Fig. 3G and H , in-dicating that diabetes induction only is sufficient to deplete leukocytes . Third , the effect of long-term hyperglycemia was tested in STZ-induced diabetic mice . Three days after STZ administration , an insulin pump was implanted sub-cutaneously . This procedure allowed us to control the glycemia for approximately 20 days Fig. 3I . Thereafter , the insulin pump was ineffective and the mice became diabetic again . Consistent with the two previous models , the number of leukocytes was decreased in the spleen at day 44 compared with naive mice Fig. 3J . However , the initial increase of the Treg frequency was not maintained in the blood and in the spleen in these mice , suggesting a critical role of STZ in modulating the Treg compartment Fig. 3K and L . Thus , the increase in Treg percentage correlated with STZ administration , whereas the hyper-glycemia alone also induced leukopenia . STZ is toxic for leukocytes in vitro . The effect of STZ was further tested on splenocytes in vitro . As a positive control , we first exposed C57BL 6 islets with 4.4 mmol L STZ in 10 % FCS medium or citrate buffer control medium for 1 h . This concentration was based on previous work eval-uating the effect of STZ on islets in vitro 18 . Thereafter , islets were washed and maintained in culture for 24 h in 10 % FCS medium . STZ conditioned islets showed a typical necrotic aspect with loss of the integrity of the collagen capsule . In contrast , the morphology of islets cultured for 1 h in citrate buffer remained intact after 24 h Supplementary Fig. 3A . These finding were confirmed by 7AAD staining of disrupted islet cells Supplementary Fig. 3B . Splenocytes were harvested from Foxp3 knock-in mice and cultured for 1 h in STZ or citrate buffer–conditioned medium . Thereafter , the cells were washed and analyzed for 7AAD 0 , 2 , and 5 h after STZ citrate exposition . STZ-conditioned splenocytes first shifted toward apoptosis at 2 h and then mainly toward death at 5 h Fig. 4A . These results were confirmed by trypan blue staining data not shown . Percentage of 7AAD+ cells in CD4+ , Foxp3+ , CD8+ , and B cells were further analyzed at time point 2 h after STZ or citrate exposition to determine which cell subtypes were more sensitive to STZ . The ratio of 7AAD+ CD8 and B cells after STZ exposure compared with the citrate buffer control was 4.5 and 4.1 . In contrast , this ratio was only 1.3 and 1.2 for CD4+ and Treg , respectively Fig. 4B . Moreover , CD8 and B cells stained positive for Annexin V 2 h after expo-sure to STZ , suggesting that cell death was mediated through apoptotic pathways Fig. 4C . Functional tests were also performed . The proliferation of splenocytes stimulated with concanavalin A , lipopolysaccharide , or anti-CD3e mAb was abolished if exposed for 1 h to STZ Fig. 4D . The sus-ceptibility of Treg to STZ was further analyzed in vitro . Purified CD4+CD25+ T cells were incubated for 1 h with STZ or citrate buffer . Thereafter , an in vitro suppression assay was performed . CD4+CD25+ T cells still suppressed , although not completely , anti–CD3e-stimulated proliferation of CD4+CD25– T cells Fig. 4E . Furthermore , we analyzed GLUT2 mRNA in the subsets of lymphocytes , since it is one of the main pathways for uptake of STZ 1 . Neither splenocytes nor purified CD4+CD25– nor CD4+CD25+ cells were positive for GLUT2 mRNA Fig. 4F . To test whether high levels of glycemia directly affect their viability and proliferation , splenocytes harvested from naive mice were incubated with increasing amounts of glucose 11 , 22 , and 33 mmol L for 24 h . Hyperglycemia failed to induce significant toxicity , as shown by 7AAD staining Supplementary Fig. 3C . Moreover , high levels of glucose in the medium did not affect the proliferation of splenocytes Supplementary Fig. 3D . Altogether , these results showed a high susceptibility of CD8 and B cells to STZ , whereas Tregs were partially resistant . These effects were not mediated via the GLUT2 transporter , suggesting that STZ enters into lymphocytes by other pathways . Fi-nally , the observed lymphopenia in response to hypergly-cemia in vivo was not explained by a direct lymphotoxic effect of glucose in vitro . Tregs of STZ-induced diabetic mice are suppressive in vitro and proliferate in vivo . The suppressive func - tion of CD4+CD25+ Treg phenotype purified from naive group 1 or diabetic mice 3 group 2 and 13 group 3 days after STZ administration was then tested in vitro . The purity of CD4+CD25+ T cells from STZ-induced diabetic mice was similar to those isolated from naive mice data not shown . No difference was found with respect to the in vitro suppressive capacity of CD4+CD25+ Tregs , neither at day 3 nor at day 13 after STZ administration in comparison with Tregs of naive mice . These results suggest that Tregs in di-abetic mice retain their suppressive function in vivo Fig. 5A . The proliferation rate of Tregs was further analyzed in the blood and in the spleen . Ki67-positive cells were gated in CD8+ , total CD4+ , and CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ T cells . Treg pro-liferation increased at days 5 and 7 in the blood Fig. 5B . Moreover , TGF-b measured in the plasma of STZ mice was also enhanced at day 7 Fig . 5C . In the spleen , no difference was detected in Treg proliferation between days 3 and 7 , although their basal proliferation rate was higher than that of total CD4+ cells Fig. 5D . In addition , Treg proliferation accounted for up to 50 % of the total CD4+ cell proliferation data not shown . Thus , these results demonstrate that the proliferative response of Tregs to STZ in vivo also contrib-utes to the increase of their frequency in the blood but not in the spleen . STZ-induced diabetic mice are immunosuppressed . We further investigated the effect of STZ-induced lymphopenia and increased percentage of Tregs on allograft rejection . First , STZ-induced diabetic and naive C57BL 6 mice were transplanted with BALB c pancreatic islets . Ten days after Tx , the mice were killed and grafts were analyzed by im-munohistology . Islets were completely destroyed in naive mice Fig. 6D and E , whereas in STZ-induced diabetic mice , the islets were stained positive for insulin Fig. 6A and B . The median graft survival MGS in STZ-induced di-abetic mice was 17.5 days data not shown . Moreover , higher numbers of Foxp3+ cells were found within the graft of diabetic mice compared with naive mice Fig. 6C–F . To confirm these results in a more stringent Tx model , STZ-induced diabetic and naive C57BL 6 H2b mice were grafted with BL 6xDBA 2 F1 H2bxH2d skin 3 days after STZ administration . At the same time , an insulin pump was implanted subcutaneously in STZ-induced diabetic mice to correct the blood glucose , allowing the mice to survive . Skin grafts were rejected approximately 1 week later in STZ-induced diabetic mice MGS 20 days compared with untreated mice MGS , 14 days Fig. 6G and H . These results demonstrate that STZ treatment delays allogeneic graft rejection and that this immunosuppressive effect is not specific to islet Tx . To further confirm the immunosup-pressive effect of STZ-induced diabetes , BL 6xDBA 2 F1 H2bxH2d skin grafts were transplanted to naive and STZ-induced diabetic mice + insulin pump treated with anti-CD154 mAb MR1 . MR1 alone had a similar effect than STZ with an MGS of 18 days . MR1 therapy significantly improved the skin graft survival in STZ-induced diabetic mice MGS 38 days , P , 0.0001 , demonstrating that diabetes induction with STZ potentiates the immunosuppressive effect of the MR1 Fig. 6G . Thus , these results suggest that many results obtained in STZ-induced diabetic mice with respect to long-term graft tolerance may be overestimated . DISCUSSION The goal of this study was to analyze the effect of STZ on the immune system and the outcome of allotransplantation with respect to graft rejection and tolerance . Our results demonstrate that STZ-induced diabetic mice are immuno-suppressed compared with naive mice , leading to prolonged islet and skin allograft survival . Two mechanisms are put forward to explain the observed immunosuppression asso-ciated with STZ treatment the induction of lymphopenia and a shift toward Tregs . Consistent with previous reports , STZ was directly toxic for lymphocytes , inducing apoptosis in vitro , and was re-sponsible for early depletion of blood and spleen lym-phocytes in vivo . A study published over 25 years ago 2 had shown that incubation of splenocytes with STZ in vitro abrogated their capacity to proliferate in response to var-ious stimuli . However , these data were not further in-vestigated since then with respect to the characterization of the different susceptibility of lymphocytes subset to STZ . It is noteworthy that , in our study , CD8+ T cells and B cells were particularly sensitive to STZ toxicity in vitro . This observation is in line with the decrease in CD8+ T-cell numbers in the peripheral blood of STZ-treated mice . Be-cause CD8+ T cells are known to play a critical role in b-cell autoimmunity and rejection , direct CD8+ depletion induced by STZ administration may contribute to the bet-ter islet engraftment described after Tx . Indeed , NOD mice treated with anti-CD8 mAb or small doses of STZ in early life are protected from spontaneous diabetes 5,19,20 . In addition , our results demonstrate that the uptake of STZ into lymphocytes occurs independently of the transporter GLUT2 , which is known to be the main pathway for STZ uptake into b-cells 21 . Because STZ is a glucose analog and lymphocytes depend on glucose 22 , several other active and passive glucose transporters such as GLUT1 could be implicated . Thus , further investigation is warranted to determine the receptors responsible for the transport of STZ into lymphocytes and its toxic effects that finally lead to their death . Importantly , STZ is not the only factor leading to T-cell depletion in STZ-induced diabetic mice . In agreement with similar observations in various animal models of diabetes 7,23 , we demonstrate here that acute hyperglycemia induces lymphopenia . Three different models of diabetes were used , and all induced lymphopenia independently of STZ 1 new-onset diabetes induction in RIP-DTR mice , 2 recurrent nephrectomy of transplanted syngeneic islets , and 3 continuous hyperglycemia STZ-induced diabetic mice treated with an insulin pump . However , the mechanisms leading to hyperglycemia-induced lymphopenia remain poorly defined . Our results support the notion that indirect pathways are responsible for the observed lymphopenia in vivo because exposure of lymphocytes to high levels of glucose in vitro did not significantly affect their viability or their capacity to proliferate . Diabetes onset is known to be associated with high serum levels of glucocorticoids , which are lymphotoxic 24 . A potential role of glucocorticoids in hyperglycemia-induced lymphopenia is further supported by the fact that adrenalectomy before diabetes induction hampered the increase of glucocorticoids and the associ-ated lymphopenia 7,25 . Others showed an adrenal hy-persensitivity preceding the blood hypercorticism 26 . Thus , it is likely that dehydration in diabetic mice induces antidiuretic hormone release , which in turn directly sensi-tizes the adrenal glands to produce glucocorticoids 27 . Nevertheless , this hypothesis still remains to be confirmed in STZ-induced diabetic mice . The second important observation in STZ-induced di-abetic mice was the increase of Treg frequencies in the spleen , the peripheral blood , and also in lymph nodes data not shown . In addition , Tregs were detected in islet allo-grafts after STZ administration , with longer graft survival in STZ-induced diabetic mice compared with control mice . On the basis of these observations and similar reports , we and others suggested a role of Tregs in the control of im-mune responses after allo-and xenogeneic islet Tx 9,13 or solid organ Tx 28,29 . It is not necessarily an increase of the absolute numbers of Tregs but rather a favorable shift of the Treg T effector cell ratio that is “tolerogenic” 30,31 . Importantly , the relative increase of Tregs correlated specifically with the administration of STZ and was not a consequence of hyperglycemia , since neither early DT administration to RIP-DTR mice nor late removal of islet grafts long after STZ diabetes induction hyperglycemia affected the percentage of Tregs . The relative increase of Tregs was also associated with a higher level of Treg pro-liferation in the blood . Finally , TGF-b , which has been shown to convert naive CD4+CD25– T cells into CD4+CD25+ Tregs in vitro , was increased in the peripheral blood of mice 3 and 7 days after STZ injection 32 . Parallel findings were reported after lymphocyte depletion using monoclonal antibodies either anti-CD3 antibody therapy [ 33,34 ] or Campath [ anti-CD52 ] [ 35,36 ] . Thus , it is likely that a pro-found depletion of T cells mediated by STZ , anti-CD3 , or Campath may lead to an increased proliferation of Tregs . More recently , a predominant role for the production of systemic TGF-b was attributed to macrophages and dendritic cells 37 . Furthermore , the association between apoptotic cell phagocytosis and TGF-b2mediated Treg expansion has led to the development of experimental therapies consisting in intravenous apoptotic cell infusion 38,39 . Taken together , one might speculate that Treg expansion in STZ-induced diabetic mice is mediated by TGF-b in an apoptosis-prone lymphopenic environment , but this hypothesis warrants further testing . Overall , this study emphasizes the immunomodulation that occurs after STZ administration . Indeed , diabetic mice display a severe lymphopenia combined with a relative increase of Tregs in the blood , spleen , and lymph nodes . These are important changes to consider and to discuss in future studies using STZ-induced diabetic mice , in partic-ular , in the setting of tolerogenic protocols for islet Tx . Because our work also shows that acute hyperglycemia is sufficient to induce lymphopenia , it is likely that any model that is based on diabetes induction is biased toward im-munosuppression . In conclusion , the results of previous studies of Tx tolerance induction and immunosuppressive protocols might be overestimated using STZ-induced di-abetes models and need to be reinterpreted in light of the present findings .

21762413	Introduction Recently , increasing numbers of membrane-deform-ing proteins have been found . These proteins belong to the BAR domain superfamily and contain the Bin-Amphiphysin-Rvs167 BAR domain , extended Fes-CIP4 homology EFC ? FCH-BAR F-BAR domain and IRSp53-NIM homology domain IMD ? inverse-BAR I-BAR domain McMahon Gallop 2005 Frost et al. 2009 Itoh Takenawa 2009 Suet-sugu et al. 2010 . The BAR and EFC domains form a crescent-shaped dimer with a positively charged concave surface . The positively charged surface of the domains binds to the negatively charged inner surface of the plasma membrane , mostly through Communicated by Yoshimi Takai *Correspondence hnakanis @ gpo.kumamoto-u.ac.jp aPresent address Department of Cell Biology , Duke University Medical School , Durham , NC 27710 , USA . and transmembrane cargo proteins . In parallel to the assembly , membrane curvature is generated to form hemispherical clathrin-coated pits CCPs . This pro-cess slowly leads to deep membrane invagination . Subsequently , the neck of invaginated pits is con-stricted and severed to separate the newly formed clathrin-coated vesicles CCVs from the plasma membrane . The membrane curvatures in CME are considered to be generated , recognized and ? or main-tained by the BAR and EFC domain proteins . We have previously identified an endocytic protein , named SGIP1a Uezu et al. 2007 . This molecule binds to PS and phosphoinositides and deforms the plasma membrane and liposomes into narrow tubules . This lipid binding and membrane tubulation are medi-ated by the N-terminal lipid-binding domain , named membrane phospholipid MP-binding domain . The MP domain shows no significant homology to the BAR and EFC domains . SGIP1a also has the l-sub-unit homology lH domain that interacts with Eps15 , an adaptor protein of the CME machinery . Ubiquitination is the covalent attachment of ubiquitin Ub , an 8.6-kD protein , on a lysine residue of a target protein Haglund Dikic 2005 . Target proteins are modified by the attachment of a single molecule of Ub monoubiquitination or multiubiqui-tination when multiple lysine residues are monoubiq-uitinated by short chains of two or three Ubs oligoubiquitination or by long chains of at least four Ubs polyubiquitination . Different types of ubiquitination are thought to regulate different cellular processes . Eps15 is subjected to monoubiqui-tination and contains Ub-interacting motifs UIMs at the C-terminus , which is considered to recognize ubiquitinated cargo molecules in CME van Bergen En Henegouwen 2009 . Recently , FCHO1 and FCHO2 , which are highly homologous to SGIP1a , have been shown to play an essential role in CME Henne et al. 2010 . They lack the MP domain but contain the EFC domain . FCHO1 and FCHO2 are proposed to function as nu-cleators of CME , but have not been fully character-ized . Here , we perform characterization of FCHO2 , including tissue distribution , subcellular localization , biochemical properties and roles in CME . FCHO family members We compared the domain organization of mouse SGIP1a to those of mouse FCHO1 and FCHO2 . SGIP1a consists of the MP domain , a proline-rich PR domain and the lH domain Fig. 1 Uezu et al. 2007 . Both FCHO1 and FCHO2 lack the MP domain but possess the EFC domain at the N-termi-nus . The amino acid aa sequence downstream of the MP domain shows significant homology to that downstream of the EFC domain of FCHO1 and FCHO2 , although the extent of homology varied between molecular regions . Thus , SGIP1a , FCHO1 and FCHO2 constitute a family whose members share some features of domain organization . Tissue distribution of FCHO1 and FCHO2 We have previously shown that SGIP1a is specifically expressed in neural tissue Uezu et al. 2007 . To exam-ine the tissue distribution of FCHO1 and FCHO2 , we carried out Northern blotting . Approximately 4 kb of FCHO1 mRNA was predominantly hybridized in brain and spleen Fig. 2A . Approximately 6 kb of FCHO2 mRNA was detected in all mouse tissues , including heart , brain , spleen , lung , liver , skeletal muscle , kidney and testis . We also carried out Western blotting , for which we prepared anti-FCHO1 and anti-FCHO2 polyclonal antibodies . The anti-FCHO1 antibody specifically recognized recombinant FCHO1 but not SGIP1a or FCHO2 Fig. 2B . However , this antibody did not detect endogenous FCHO1 in all mouse tissues examined data not shown , suggesting that the expression level of endogenous FCHO1 protein is much lower than those of SGIP1a and FCHO2 . Conversely , the anti-FCHO2 antibody specifically recognized endogenous and recombinant FCHO2 . This antibody did not recognize SGIP1a or FCHO1 . Consistent with Northern blotting , Western blotting showed that FCHO2 was ubiquitously expressed Fig. 2C . These results indicate that each member of the FCHO family shows unique tissue distribution . FCHO2 oligomerization We focused on FCHO2 because it was ubiquitously expressed . The molecular mass of FCHO2 was esti-mated by gel filtration . When hexahistidine His6 -FCHO2 full length was subjected to Superdex 200 column chromatography , it appeared at a position corresponding to approximately 340 kD Fig. 3 . As the molecular mass value of FCHO2 estimated by SDS–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis PAGE is approximately 90 kD , these results suggest that FCHO2 might form a tetramer . Lipid binding and membrane tubulation of FCHO2 To next examine the lipid binding and membrane tubulation of FCHO2 , we carried out a liposome co-sedimentation assay . Although glutathione S-transfer-ase GST -FCHO2–1 EFC domain , aa 1–302 did not bind to synthetic liposomes composed of phosphatidylethanolamine PE and phosphatidylcho-line PC , it strongly bound to liposomes containing PS Fig. 4A . The percentage of PS in liposomes required for maximal binding was approximately 20 % . The EFC domain bound to liposomes contain-ing phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate PI3P , PI4P , PI5P , PI 3,4 -bisphosphate P2 , PI 3,5 P2 , PI 4,5 P2 or PI 3,4,5 -trisphosphate P3 , but we observed neg-ligible binding to liposomes containing PI Fig. 4B . The FCHO2 EFC domain bound to brain liposomes Folch lipid rich in PS approximately 50 % of total lipids and appears to have similar lipid specificity of the SGIP1a MP domain Uezu et al. 2007 . The Kd value of the FCHO2 EFC domain for PI 4,5 P2 was calculated to be approximately 7 · 10 7 M Fig. 4C , which is similar to the Kd values of the PLCd1 pleckstrin homology domain , the epsin ENTH domain , the FBP17 EFC domain and the SGIP1a MP domain , which are all known to bind to PI 4,5 P2 with high affinity Itoh et al. 2001 Ford et al. 2002 Tsujita et al. 2006 Uezu et al. 2007 . Using brain liposomes containing rhodamine-con-jugated PE , we then examined whether the EFC domain deforms liposomes into tubules . GST-FCHO2–1 EFC domain induced tubulation whereas GST alone did not Fig . 4D . Furthermore , expres-sion of enhanced green fluorescent protein EGFP -FCHO2–1 EFC domain induced the formation of tubular structures in COS7 cells Fig. 4E . The tubu-lar structures were completely overlapped with those stained by a lipophilic fluorescent probe , DiIC16 3 Mukherjee Maxfield 2000 , indicating that the tubular structures originate from membranes . Taken together , these results indicate that the FCHO2 EFC domain binds to PS and phosphoinositides and deforms membranes into tubules . Interaction of FCHO2 with Eps15 and the AP-2 complex To examine whether FCHO2 interacts with Eps15 through the lH domain , we prepared maltose-binding protein MBP -Eps15 that corresponds to the Asp-Pro-Phe DPF repeat domain aa 593–834 . The DPF repeat domain has been shown to interact with the AP-2 complex , the major adaptor protein in CME , which consists of a , b2 , r2 and l2 adaptins Salcini et al. 1999 Roy Wrana 2005 Doherty McMahon 2009 Traub 2009 . MBP-Eps15 bound to GST-FCHO2–3 lH domain , aa 526–809 immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads , whereas MBP alone did not Fig . 5A . Neither MBP alone nor MBP-Eps15 bound to GST immobilized on beads . We furthermore examined the in vivo binding of FCHO2 to Eps15 by immunoprecipitation . When endogenous FCHO2 was immunoprecipitated from HeLa cell lysate with anti-FCHO2 antibody , endogenous Eps15 was co-precipi-tated Fig. 5B . a-Adaptin , a component of the AP-2 complex , was also co-precipitated with FCHO2 and Eps15 . These results indicate that FCHO2 interacts with Eps15 and the AP-2 complex in vitro and in vivo . FCHO2 ubiquitination We examined whether FCHO2 is ubiquitinated . EGFP-FCHO2 was co-expressed with hemagglutinin HA -tagged Ub HA-Ub in COS7 cells , followed by immunoprecipitation with anti-EGFP antibody in the presence of N-ethylmaleimide NEM , an inhibitor of deubiquitinating enzymes . Immunoblotting with the anti-EGFP antibody showed two bands , the lower of which corresponded to unmodified EGFP-FCHO2 Fig. 6A . The upper band was strongly recognized by anti-HA antibody . In addition , the antibody recog-nized a smear of higher-molecular-mass proteins that represent a multitude of polyubiquitinated proteins . These results indicate that FCHO2 is ubiquitinated . The main type of ubiquitination is monoubiquitination . To next examine which domain is monoubiquiti-nated , EGFP-FCHO2–1 EFC domain , aa 1–302 , EGFP-FCHO2–2 aa 303–525 or EGFP-FCHO2–3 lH domain , aa 526–809 was co-expressed with HA-Ub in COS7 cells . Immunoblotting with anti-EGFP antibody showed that FCHO2–1 showed bands of unmodified and modified higher-molecular-mass proteins Fig. 6B . Anti-HA antibody recognized a band with a molecular mass of approximately 72 kD that corresponded to monoubiquitinated FCHO2–1 . In contrast , immunoblotting with anti-EGFP antibody showed that FCHO2–2 and FCHO2–3 showed only unmodified bands . However , immunoblotting with anti-HA antibody showed that FCHO2–2 and FCHO2–3 showed several bands and ? or smears of higher molecular mass . A band of FCHO2–3 with a molecular mass of approximately 67 kD corresponded to monoubiquitinated FCHO2–3 . These results suggest that the EFC and lH domains are monoubiquitinated , but the domain of full-length FCHO2 involved in monoubiquitination remains to be confirmed . Subcellular localization of FCHO2 We examined the subcellular localization of FCHO2 in HeLa cells by immunofluorescence microscopy . FCHO2 showed a punctate staining pattern and colocalized with endogenous a-adaptin and Eps15 Fig. 7A . However , some FCHO2 dots did not colocalize with either a-adaptin or Eps15 . The AP-2 complex is restricted to CCPs ? CCVs , whereas Eps 15 is reported to localize not only to CCPs but also to early endosomes and the nucleus Roy Wrana 2005 van Bergen En Henegouwen 2009 . These results indicate that FCHO2 localizes not only to CCPs ? CCVs but also to other intracellular compartments . To confirm the localization of FCHO2 at CCPs , EGFP-FCHO2 and DsRed-monomer clathrin light chain were co-expressed in HeLa cells and observed by total internal reflection fluorescence TIRF microscopy . EGFP-FCHO2 and DsRed-monomer clathrin light chain colocal-ized at the plasma membrane Fig . 7B . To next examine the localization of FCHO2 in mouse tissue , frozen sections of mouse kidney were subjected to staining with anti-FCHO2 antibody . FCHO2 was enriched in the apical region of renal tubular epithelial cells , whereas E-cadherin , a cell–cell adhesion molecule , localized to the lateral membrane Fig . 7C . While the FCHO2 signals showed a string of strong fluorescent dots at the apical region , the signals were also faintly detected in the basolat-eral membrane . Clathrin has been shown to exhibit a similar staining pattern in renal tubular epithelial cells Hasse et al. 2006 . These results suggest that FCHO2 localizes to CCPs ? CCVs in renal tubular epithelial cells . FCHO2 is required for CME of transferrin Finally , we examined whether FCHO2 is required for endocytosis using siRNA knockdown methods . Immunoblotting showed that FCHO2 siRNA reduced the expression level of FCHO2 in HeLa cells Fig. 8A . In cells with reduced FCHO2 expression , the internalization of [ 125I ] -labeled transferrin was remarkably reduced compared with that in cells treated with control siRNA Fig. 8B . In contrast , the internalization of [ 125I ] -labeled EGF in cells treated with FCHO2 siRNA was not significantly reduced compared with that in cells treated with control siR-NA . These findings suggest that FCHO2 is involved in CME and is required for the endocytosis of transferrin but not of EGF . This difference might be due to the presence of redundant pathways in EGF endocytosis . In this study , we have characterized FCHO2 , an EFC domain-containing protein . The EFC domain binds not only to PS but also to phosphoinositides and deforms membranes into narrow tubules . Further-more , FCHO2 binds to the Eps15 DPF repeat domain through the lH domain . FCHO2 localizes to CCPs and is required for CME of transferrin but not of EGF . These properties are similar to those of SGIP1a Uezu et al. 2007 , suggesting that FCHO2 and SGIP1a are functionally redundant . FCHO2 is on late endocytic compartments . PI4P is present on the trans-Golgi network . FCHO2 might localize to these organelles through interactions with these phos-phoinositides . In general , EFC domains form a dimer Doherty McMahon 2009 Frost et al. 2009 Itoh Takena-wa 2009 Suetsugu et al. 2010 . We have shown that FCHO2 might form a tetramer . Another domain or region might be responsible for the tetramer forma-tion . Eps15 has also been shown to be oligomerized through homophilic interactions Tebar et al. 1997 . The interaction of FCHO2 and Eps15 is presumed to enhance their oligomerization , which induces their clustering at the plasma membrane and might subsequently cause the CCP nucleation . Eps15 is modified by the attachment of a single Ub moiety monoubiquitination van Bergen En Henegouwen 2009 . It is proposed that a single Ub moiety attached to Eps15 binds to the UIM on the same molecule , resulting in the prevention of its polyubiquitination . We have shown that FCHO2 is mainly monoubiquitinated . The Ub moiety attached to FCHO2 might also bind to the Eps15 UIM , pre-venting its polyubiquitination . Thus , the interaction with Eps15 might be required for FCHO2 mono-ubiquitination . It has been shown that FCHO2 accumulates at the plasma membrane before clathrin assembly and dissociates from CCPs before the departure of CCVs from the plasma membrane Henne et al. 2010 . As described earlier , PI 4,5 P2 is likely to recruit FCHO2 to the plasma membrane , but little is known about the mechanism by which FCHO2 dissociates from the plasma membrane . However , this dissociation of FCHO2 might be regulated by monoubiquitination . Monoubiquitination is considered to have several regulatory roles for target proteins , such as changes in subcellular localization , conformation , activity and protein interactions Haglund Dikic 2005 . We have suggested that the EFC and lH domains are monoubiquitinated . The lysine residues in these domains are crucial for their interactions with mem-branes and Eps15 , respectively Henne et al. 2007 Henne et al. 2010 . Monoubiquitination of these domains might inhibit their interactions . Further studies are required to clarify the roles of FCHO2 monoubiquitination .

21763481	Introduction Meckel syndrome MKS [ MIM 249000 ] is a rare autosomal-recessive disorder resulting in perinatal lethality and characterized by renal cysts , hepatic ductal plate malfor-mation , and central nervous system defects , such as occip-ital encephalocele.1 Mutations in six genes are known to cause MKS MKS1 MIM 609883 , TMEM216 MKS2 [ MIM 613277 ] , TMEM67 MKS3 [ MIM 609884 ] , CEP290 MKS4 [ MIM 610142 ] , RPGRIP1L MKS5 [ MIM 610937 ] , and CC2D2A MKS6 [ MIM 612013 ] .2–7 In addition , mutations in NPHP3 MKS7 [ MIM 608002 ] and TCTN2 MKS8 cause MKS-like phenotypes.8,9 The products of these genes localize to cilia and or basal bodies , supporting the hypothesis that ciliary dysfunction underlies MKS . MKS1 , a variant of which was the first gene linked to MKS , encodes a protein containing a B9 domain , structur-ally similar to the lipid binding domains of the C2 family.10 Although none of the other previously recog-nized MKS proteins contain B9 domains , bilaterians including mammals , Drosophila , and C. elegans possess two other B9 domain-containing proteins , B9d1 and B9d2 also known as Stumpy [ MIM 611951 ] . B9 domain-containing proteins are also present in diverse ciliated protists , including Trypanosomes , Naegleria , and Batra-chochytrium , but are absent from nonciliated eukaryotes , including most yeast and higher plants see Figure S1 avail-able online . Consistent with a role in cilia function , all three B9 domain proteins localize to the transition zone of C. elegans cilia or the basal body and axoneme of mammalian cilia.11–14 Mouse embryos homozygous for a loss-of-function mutation in Mks1 display hallmarks of MKS , such as renal cysts , ductal plate malformation , and brain malformations similar to occipital meningoencepha-locele . In addition , these mutants displayed cleft palate and polydactyly , phenotypes associated commonly with MKS1 MIM 249000 .13,15–18 Conditional inactivation of B9d2 in the brain and kidney cause hydrocephalus and renal cysts , accompanied by defects in ependymal and kidney cilia.14 Primary cilia are required for mammalian development , in part because of their roles in mediating Hh signal trans-duction.19 Hh signals participate in the patterning of a large number of tissues , including the neural tube and limb buds . Components of the Hh pathway , including Patched1 Ptc1 , Smoothened Smo , and the Gli transcrip-tional effectors , localize to primary cilia , suggesting that critical Hh signal transduction events occur within cilia.20–22 Consistent with this hypothesis , vertebrate mutations that disrupt ciliogenesis cause defects in Hh signaling and concomitant developmental phenotypes.23 To investigate further the role of B9 proteins in ciliogen-esis and in the pathogenesis of MKS , we analyzed mice mutant for the third member of the B9 genes , B9d1 . Strik-ingly , loss of B9d1 resulted in MKS-like phenotypes in mouse embryos which , taken together with the mouse mutant data for B9d2 , suggested that these two loci are candidates for causing severe ciliopathies . Therefore , we screened MKS fetuses for mutations in B9D1 and B9D2 and identified a homozygous mutation in B9D2 . We also found that all three B9 proteins interact physically with each other but that the MKS-associated disease allele of B9d2 exhibited decreased affinity for Mks1 . These findings reveal that a complex comprised of the three B9 proteins support mammalian ciliogenesis , disruption of which results in Hh signaling defects and MKS . Material and Methods B9 Protein Conservation Mouse Strains Electron Microscopy For SEM analysis , E8.0 2–3 somite embryos were fixed for 1 hr in 2 % sodium cacodylate buffer , postfixed in 1 % osmium tetroxide Plasmid Construction Cell Culture , Immunofluorescence , and Microscopy qRT-PCR Human Genetics The study was approved by the review board and ethics committee of the RWTH Aachen University and the participants gave informed consent . Linkage Analysis Mutation Analysis Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblot Modeling of the B9D2 C2 Domain Results Mouse B9d1 Mutants Display Developmental Defects Similar to Those of MKS Given the importance of Mks1 and B9d2 , two genes en-coding B9 domain proteins , to ciliary structure , we investi-gated the function of the third member of this family , B9d1.13,14,42 We obtained a targeted allele of B9d1 B9d1tm1a EUCOMM Wtsi from the European Conditional Mouse Mutagenesis Program EUCOMM that contains a gene trap in the second of six introns Figure S2A . The resultant mutant allele is predicted to encode a fusion between the first 44 amino acids and a bgeo reporter . Given that the wild-type transcript is almost completely abro-gated in homozygous B9d1 mutant embryos Figure S2B , Age B9d1 ? ? B9d1 ? B9d1 E8.0 10 47 21 24 47 51 13 47 28 E8.5 2 15 13 9 15 60 4 15 27 E9.5 22 95 23 48 95 51 25 95 26 E10.5 35 112 31 57 112 51 20 112 18 E11.5 15 55 27 28 55 51 12 55 22 E12.5 19 67 28 33 67 49 15 67 23 E13.5 28 93 30 41 93 44 24 93 26 E14.5 5 12 42 7 12 58 0 12 0 Embryonic survival scored at the ages listed . Shown is the number of surviving embryos among the total examined , with percentages in parentheses . the B9d1 gene trap is likely to create a null or near null allele . In support of this conclusion , we also analyzed mice homozygous for a deletion of B9d1 exon 3 , which encodes a large portion of the B9 domain , and these mutants displayed phenotypes indistinguishable from those homozygous for the gene trap allele data not shown . B9d1 mutants die at approximately E14.5 Table 1 . Mutant phenotypes were assessed in the strain of deriva-tion , C57 Bl6 , where possible , and in a mixed C57 Bl6-CD1 strain to observe later stages of development , because homozygous mutant embryos on the mixed background die between E17.5 and P1 . At E18.5 , these B9d1 mutant mice displayed kidneys that were larger than wild-type and contained multiple cystic lesions in all of the mutants examined n ? 5 5 Figure 1A . Dilation and cystic path-ology was apparent in multiple nephron segments Fig-ure S3 . Kidney tubules were well ciliated in wild-type animals , whereas the tubules were enlarged and cilia were reduced in number and length in B9d1 mutants Figure 1B . During liver development , hepatic ductal plates form as rings around portal veins and are subse-quently remodeled , positioning bile ducts centrally adja-cent to portal veins by birth.43 In contrast , ductal plates persisted as peripheral rings in B9d1 mutant livers at P1 , and hyperplastic portal mesenchyme separated enlarged bile ducts from portal veins Figures 1C and 1D . Cilia were present and similar in length in wild-type and mutant bile ducts despite the occurrence of ductal plate malforma-tion Figure 1E . B9d1 mutants also developed preaxial polydactyly with either one or two extra digits , with 92 % n ? 23 25 pene-trance in hindlimbs and 24 % n ? 6 25 penetrance in forelimbs Figure 1F . We also observed occasional exence-phaly n ? 3 49 Figure 1G . Thus , B9d1 mouse mutants display renal cystic dysplasia , the defect most commonly associated with MKS , as well as ductal plate malformation of the liver and polydactyly , other prominent characteris-tics of MKS . In addition to displaying hallmarks of MKS , B9d1 mutants display dextrocardia with a frequency of 44 % n ? 20 45 , suggesting that heart looping is randomized in the mutant embryos Figure 1H . We observed addi-tional phenotypes associated with human ciliopathies in B9d1 mutants at varying frequencies , including holopro-sencephaly Figure 1H , microphthalmia n ? 32 37 Figure 1G , cleft palate n ? 9 19 Figure S4 , ventricular septal defect VSD , and thinning of the myocardial wall Figure S5 . Randomized heart looping can be due to disruptions in fluid flow in the embryonic node.44 Because beating cilia propel nodal flow leftward , mutations in ciliogenic genes such as Kif3a and Ift88 disrupt left-right patterning.45,46 To assess whether defects in ciliogenesis might underlie the randomized heart looping observed in B9d1 mutant mice , we examined nodes with both immunofluorescence and scanning electron microscopy SEM . B9d1 mutants exhibited normal node morphology , but lacked almost all nodal cilia Figures 2A–2D the few cilia that did form were short and displayed swollen tips Figure 2D . In addi-tion to analyzing nodal cilia , we examined the expression pattern of Lefty genes , early molecular markers , and genes implicated in the establishment of left-right patter-ning.28,47–49 In response to nodal flow , Lefty1 2 are expressed in the floorplate and left lateral plate mesoderm LPM of E8.0 embryos . Expression of Lefty1 2 was absent in B9d1 mutant embryos at E8.0 n ? 2 2 Figure 2E , which is similar to other mutants in which L-R patterning is disrupted at an early stage of axis specification.44,50–54 We surmise that the absence of nodal cilia is the likely cause of the laterality and heart looping defects of B9d1 mutants . Mouse B9d1 Is Required for Hh Signaling and Ciliary Protein Localization Cilia are essential for the transduction of several intercel-lular signals , most notably Hh during neural tube develop-ment.23,24,55–59 B9d1 mutants lack cilia in the neural tube Figure 2F and exhibit holoprosencephaly Figure 1H , a phenotype associated with abrogated Hh signaling.60 Further analysis of the neural tube by transmission elec-tron microscopy TEM revealed that basal bodies in B9d1 mutant embryos dock properly at the apical surface of the cell yet do not form axonemes Figures 2G and 2H . To test whether Hh signaling is affected in B9d1 mutants , we examined patterning of the ventral neural tube.61 During neural tube development , high levels and durations of Hh signaling specify the ventral-most cell fates , including the floor plate , whereas moderate Hh signaling specifies more dorsal neural subtypes , including motor neurons.62,63 Molecular analysis of FoxA2 expression , a marker of the floor plate , indicated that the floor plate is reduced in B9d1 mutants Figure 3A . Similar to the floor plate , high levels of Hh signaling are required for the induction of adjoi-ning V3 interneuron precursors.64,65 Analysis of Nkx2.2 , a marker of V3 interneuron precursors , revealed reduced expression in B9d1 mutants Figure 3B . Additionally , B9d1 mutants showed a variable reduction in the number of motor neurons , as indicated by Islet1 2 expression Figure 3C . The loss or reduction of ventral neural marker expressionin B9d1 mutantswasaccompaniedbytheventral expansion of Pax6 expression Figures 3A–3C , normally restricted to the dorsal neural tube by Hh signaling.66 Together , these results indicate that B9d1 is required for high and moderate level Hh signaling in the neural tube . In addition to their roles in promoting activation of the Hh transcriptional program , cilia are essential for the for-mation of the transcriptional repressor form of Gli3 Gli3R .22,59 Unlike the neural tube , Shh controls antero-posterior limb bud patterning principally by inhibiting the formation of Gli3R . Shh is secreted from the zone of polarizing activity in the posterior of the limb bud , creating an opposing gradient of Gli3R decreasing from anterior to posterior.67 Loss of Gli3 results in polydactyly , similar to Shh gain of function.68,69 Mice with defects in ciliogenesis can display preaxial polydactyly , attributable to defects in Gli3R formation.22,59,70,71 The presence of preaxial polydactyly in B9d1 mutants Figure 1F was consistent with defective Gli3 processing . B9d1 mutants typically developed one or two supernu-mary preaxial digits on hindlimbs and occasionally on forelimbs , a limb phenotype more pronounced than that reported for Mks1 mutants.13,15 To assess whether B9d1 is required for Gli3 processing , we analyzed Gli3 in B9d1 heterozygote and mutant mouse embryo lysates . Full-length Gli3 was stabilized in mutant embryos compared to wild-type Figure 4A , consistent with reduced Hh responsiveness . In response to Hh ligand , Smoothened Smo , a positive regulator of Hh signaling , translocates into primary cilia and activates the pathway.20 To examine further the role of B9d1 in Hh signal transduction , we analyzed the locali-zation of Smo to cilia in response to Smo AGonist SAG . Similar to the cilia status of bile ducts , mouse embryonic fibroblasts MEFs derived from B9d1 mutant embryos were ciliated Figure 4B . In response to SAG treatment , Smo localized to cilia in WT MEFs but not B9d1 mutant MEFs Figure 4B Figure S6 , consistent with reduced Hh responsiveness . We also quantified the change in mRNA levels of Gli1 and Ptc1 , general transcriptional targets of Hh signaling , in MEFs treated with SAG . B9d1 mutant MEFs treated with SAG showed blunted increases in Gli1 and Ptc1 activation as compared to WT SAG-treated MEFs Figures 4C and 4D . Together , these results indicate that B9d1 is required for robust responsiveness to Hh signals even in cells that do not require B9d1 for ciliogenesis . Given the failure of Smo to move to MEF cilia in response to SAG , we asked whether other ciliary proteins might fail to localize properly to the cilia of B9d1 mutant MEFs . Whereas the intraflagellar transport protein Ift88 localized to both WT and B9d1 mutant MEF cilia , the small GTPase Arl13b and the adenylate cyclase ACIII were found only in WT MEF cilia Figures 4E–4G Figure S6 .22,55,72 This protein localization defect is similar to that seen upon disruption of Tctn1 , Tctn2 , Tmem67 , or Cc2d2a , components of a larger transition zone complex that also contains B9 proteins Table S3 .73 Thus , B9d1 is required for the ciliary localization of a discrete subset of proteins , including Smo , Arl13b , and ACIII . B9D2 Is a Candidate MKS Locus B9d2 , a B9 protein related to B9d1 , localizes to the basal body and the ciliary axoneme , and loss of B9d2 , either in vivo or in cultured cells , results in ciliogenic defects.11,14,42 In addition , conditional inactivation of B9d2 in the kidney produces cysts similar to those of Mks1 and B9d1 mutant mice.13–15 The phenotypic overlap observed between Mks1 , B9d1 , and B9d2 mutant mice , and the evolutionarily co-occurrence of these genes , suggested that human B9D1 and B9D2 variants could cause MKS . To test this hypothesis , we used a combination of homo-zygosity mapping and candidate gene sequencing to screen B9D1 and B9D2 in 96 unrelated MKS patients . Noregions of homozygosity overlapping with B9D1 segregated with MKS phenotypes in our patient cohort , and sequencing analysis without bias for linkage or homozygosity did not identify any nonsynonymous changes that would be consistent with a pathogenic role of this gene in our cohort of MKS patients . We note , however , that a recent study reported a B9D1 mutation in an individual with MKS.74 We identi-fied a fifth-degree consanguineous multiplex family from Surinam with Indian-Pakistani background Figure 5A , in which two affected fetuses displayed overlapping pheno-types including cystic kidneys , ductal plate malformation , polydactyly , and occipital encephalocele Figures 5B–5M . Linkage analysis demonstrated identical homozygous haplotypes in both patients Figure 5A that were distinct from the haplotypes of the unaffected son Figure 5A , but no regions of homozygosity in other known MKS disease genes . Sequencing revealed a homozygous , nonconserva-tive missense mutation c.301A C in B9D2 resulting in a serine to arginine substitution p.Ser101Arg in both affected individuals Figure 5N . This change segregated with the MKS phenotype in this family , has not been described in all accessible databases of human genome vari-ation , and was not present among 300 ethnically matched control chromosomes or 388 control chromosomes from other ethnic backgrounds . Residue 101 is invariantly serine in chordate B9D2 proteins and is either a serine or threonine in the B9D2 orthologs of ciliated protists Chlamydomonas , Naegleria , and Batrachochytrium Figure 5O . This high degree of con-servation suggests that serine 101 is important for B9D2 We have shown previously that mor-pholino MO suppression of mks1 in zebrafish results in developmental defects that include shortened body axis , broad notochords , long , thin somites , and failure of tail exten-sion.34 Further , we and others have demonstrated the tractability of in vivo rescue in this system to deter-mine the pathogenic effect of alleles found in ciliary genes with high speci-ficity and sensitivity.75–77 To test the pathogenicity of the b9d2 MKS allele , we generated a splice-blocking MO against zebrafish b9d2 and attempted rescue with control or mutant human B9D2 mRNA . Injection of increasing amounts 2 , 4 , 6 ng of b9d2 MO resulted in dosage-depen-dent phenotypes that can be grouped into three classes based on previously reported criteria normal , class I , and class II .34 Class I embryos displayed mildly shortened bodyaxes , mediolaterallyelongated somites , andnotochord imperfections class II embryos displayed severely shortened body axes , mediolaterally elongated somites , and widened and kinked notochords Figure 6A Figure S8 . The specificity of the MO-induced phenotypes was confirmed by coinjection of human B9D2 mRNA . Upon masked scoring of 50–150 embryos per injection , we observed that whereas 29 % of the b9d2 morphants were designated as class I and 21 % were class II , coinjection of b9d2 morpholino with 60 pg human B9D2 mRNA reduced the prevalence of class I to 14 % and of class II to 4 % . In contrast , coinjection of b9d2 morpholino with 60 pg of human B9D2 c.301A C mRNA yielded morphants of which 33 % were scored as class I and 14 % were class II . The failure of B9D2 c.301A C to reduce the frequency of b9d2 morpholino phenotypes suggests that the MKS-asso-ciated mutation is a strong hypomorphic or functional null allele Figure 6B . Effect of the B9D2 Mutation on Protein Function To investigate the pathogenicity of the B9D2 mutant allele and the mechanisms by which it may result in ciliary dysfunction and human disease , we explored the potential consequences of the p.Ser101Arg amino acid substitution in mammalian cells . B9D2 has been shown to localize primarily to the basal body and , under certain conditions , to the axoneme of the primary cilium.11 We therefore tested whether introduction of the Arg101 residue affects B9D2 localization . Upon expression of GFP-B9D2 and GFP-B9D2 S101R in hTERT-RPE1 cells , we found that both localize to the basal body Figure 7 , rendering misloc-alization an unlikely cause of disease and pointing instead to potential biochemical causes . The phenotypic overlap caused by loss of any of the three mouse B9 proteins raised the possibility that the B9 proteins promote ciliogenesis by acting together in a nonredundant fashion . Similarly , the presence of MKS-associated mutations in B9D1 , B9D2 , and MKS1 suggests that these proteins may function cooperatively in hu-mans , reminiscent of the related ciliopathy , Bardet-Biedl syndrome BBS [ MIM 209900 ] , in which the products of several causa-tive genes can form a complex.78 To investigate whether B9 proteins might similarly form a MKS-related complex , we assessed whether tagged B9 proteins coimmunoprecipitated. GFP-tagged versions of Mks1 , B9d1 , and B9d2 coimmunoprecipitated V5-tagged versions of the other B9 proteins Figure 8 . GFP-tagged B9 proteins did not coimmunoprecipitate with the V5 vector or a V5-tagged control protein , Rer1 , indicating that the interac-tion of the B9 proteins with each other is specific . To confirm further the observed interactions , we created NIH 3T3 cell lines harboring stable , single integrations of a control plasmid expressing the localization and affinity purification LAP tag pGLAP5 or a plasmid expressing B9d1 with a carboxy-terminally fused LAP pGLAP5-B9d1 . We tandem affinity purified LAP proteins from the control and B9d1-LAP-expressing cells , separated them by gel electrophoresis , sectioned the gel lanes , and sub-jected them to mass spectrometry.29,35 Mass spectrometric analysis detected abundant peptides of Mks1 50 peptides with 37 % coverage and B9d2 32 peptides with 42 % coverage among the proteins that copurified with B9d1-LAP . We also identified a number of interacting proteins that have been suggested recently to be part of a larger transition zone complex functioning within the cilium Table S3 .73 To determine how the p.Ser101Arg mutation affects B9D2 activity , we asked whether this mutation alters B9 protein complex formation . Reciprocal coimmunoprecipi-tations indicated that B9d2 p.Ser101Arg failed to interact with Mks1 , without compromising its interaction with B9d1 Figure 8 . These results indicate that the B9 proteins interact physically and that the MKS-associated mutant form of B9d2 disrupts its interaction with Mks1 , thus compromising the integrity of this ciliogenic complex . Therefore , we propose that mutations that disrupt the interactions among components of the B9 complex result in human MKS . Discussion In the last decade , our understanding of the role of primary cilia in human disorders has benefited from the identification of a burgeoning group of ciliopathy-associ-ated genes . In this study , we showed that disruption of B9d1 in the mouse perturbs ciliogenesis and ciliary protein localization , abrogates Hh signaling , and results in phenotypes that fall on the severe end of the ciliopathy clinical spectrum . In addition , we identified a non-conservative missense mutation in B9D2 in individuals affected with MKS . Finally , we demonstrated that the B9 domain containing proteins physically interact and that the MKS-associated mutant form of B9d2 has dimin-ished function and reduced capacity to interact with Mks1 , previously implicated in MKS.2,79 Together , these results suggest that a complex of B9 proteins coopera-tively supports mammalian ciliogenesis and ciliary pro-tein localization , and abrogated complex function results in MKS . Ciliary defects compromise the response to Hh signals in vertebrates by abrogating the ability of Smo to activate both Gli2 and Gli3R formation.19,59 The Hh-related phenotypes of B9d1 mutants include dorsalization of the neural tube consistent with decreased Gli2 activity , as well as limb bud patterning defects associated with disrup-ted Gli3 processing . In MEFs , B9d1 is dispensible for cilio-genesis but is required for robust response to the Hh pathway activator SAG . This probably reflects the require-ment for B9d1 for the movement of Smo in response to pathway activation and supports the contention that some MKS phenotypes , such as polydactyly , are due to disruptions in Hh signal transduction.15 Because cilia may participate in multiple signaling pathways , other manifestations of MKS may be due to defects in intercellular communica-tion apart from Hh signaling.33,80–82 In addition to Smo , B9d1 is essential for the ciliary localization of Arl13b and ACIII . Similar defects in ciliary membrane composition are observed in mouse mutants affecting B9d1-in-teracting proteins.73 It is likely that alterations in ciliary membrane composition affect diverse ciliary functions , resulting in some of the pleiotropic phenotypes associated with MKS . Mutation of B9D2 Is Associated with MKS We detected a homozygous missense mutation affecting a highly conserved residue of B9D2 in the affected MKS individuals of a single pedigree , suggesting that B9D2 is essential for human development . In addition to the human genetic data , the failure of B9D2 bearing the p.Ser101Arg mutation to rescue zebrafish b9d2 morphants or to interact with Mks1 indicates that this mutation abro-gates function . A significant fraction of cases of other genetically hetero-geneous ciliopathies , such as nephronophthisis and BBS , are caused by private mutations.83–85 Our work indicates that this may be true for MKS as well . Human genetic studies with limited pedigrees are insufficient to prove the causality of alleles and , by extension , the causal role of specific genes in the phenotype . However , testing the allele in a physiologically relevant system provides insight into its function . In the case of the MKS-associated allele of B9D2 , we used three approaches to provide evidence of causality human genetics , in vivo rescue , and biochemical interaction data . Although we did not detect B9D1 mutations in our cohort of 96 MKS patients , a recent study identified B9D1 mutations as a cause of MKS.74 If B9D1 mutations result in early gestational lethality , as exhibited by the B9d1 mutant mice , B9D1 mutations detected in postnatal MKS cases may not reflect the prevalence of the alleles . It is striking that the B9 domain-containing proteins are found only in organisms that form cilia and that all B9 proteins are involved in ciliary functions in both C. elegans and vertebrates.11–15 The p.Ser101Arg mutation of B9D2 identified in MKS individuals occurs within the B9 domain , suggesting that it is critical to protein function . The B9 domain is related to the C2 domain involved in calcium-dependent lipid binding present in several other MKS proteins , including MKS5 RPGRIP1L and MKS6 CC2D2A .86 Despite the possibility that MKS1 , B9D1 , and B9D2 suggests shared biochemical activities with C2 domain proteins , the overlapping ciliary defects exhibited by the mouse B9 mutants suggest that they are not func-tionally redundant either with each other or with C2 domain proteins.13,15 The MKS-associated mutation in the B9 domain of B9D2 does not destabilize the protein , interfere with its localiza-tion to the ciliary base , or compromise its interaction with B9d1 . Instead , the inability of the mutant form of B9d2 to physically interact with Mks1 reveals that the mutation compromises formation of the B9 protein complex . These results suggest that B9 domains may support protein-protein interactions and that disruption of the B9 protein complex may underlie some forms of MKS . In support of the contention that B9 proteins function together in a complex , B9d1 mutant mice display pheno-types associated with the MKS1 variant of MKS , including cleft palate , holoprosencephaly , microphthalmia , and polydactyly.2,16–18 Furthermore , the two MKS fetuses harboring B9D2 mutations displayed polydactyly . The late gestational MKS fetus , in addition to occipital encephalocele , exhibited anencephaly and a sacral dimple , reflecting neural tube closure defects . Mutations in each B9 gene in humans can be associated with MKS , and loss of each B9 protein in mice causes phenotypes consistent with MKS.2,13–15,74 However , the descrip-tions of the three B9 mouse mutant phenotypes are not identical . The B9d2-null phenotype has not been described , but conditional deletion of B9d2 in the nervous system and kidneys caused kidney cysts , hydrocephalus , and a loss or stunting of cilia in the CNS.14 Two distinct Mks1 mutations cause cystic kidneys , poly-dactyly , neural tube defects , reduced skull ossification , other skeletal abnormalities , and hepatic defects . Mks1krc is a splice-site mutation that results in deletion of the B9 domain , and Mks1del64-323 is an in-frame deletion of exons 3–10 that removes the first nine amino acids of the B9 domain.13,15 Despite extensive phenotypic similarities , the two mutants are not indistinguishable . At E10.5 , Mks1krc mutants did not display gross abnormalities , whereas Mks1del64-323 mutants displayed expansion of the mesencephalic flexure , reduced telencephalon size , and microphthalmia , similar to B9d1 mutants.13,15 Moreover , Mks1del64-323 mutants exhibited neural tube patterning defects similar to those of B9d1 mutants and more profound than those of Mks1krc mutants.13,15 Because Mks1krc phenotypes were assessed on a C3H or mixed C3H CD1 background and Mks1del64-323 phenotypes were assessed on a C3H or C57Bl 6 background C. Lo , personal communication , the phenotypic differences may reflect differences in allele strength or modification by back-ground-dependent loci.13,15 In addition to MKS , defects in the function of primary cilia are thought to underlie related disorders including BBS , Leber congenital amaurosis LCA [ MIM 204000 ] , and Senior-Løken syndrome SLSN [ MIM 266900 ] . Several of these disorders share retinal degeneration as a feature but include other characteristics such as obesity , polydactyly , and renal abnormalities BBS , midface hypoplasia LCA , or nephronophthisis , a cystic kidney disorder SLSN . Further examples of ciliopathies include Joubert syndrome JBTS [ MIM 213300 ] , characterized by hypoplasia of the cerebellar vermis , and Orofaciodigital syndrome OFD [ MIM 311200 ] , characterized by malformation of the face , mouth , and digits . It is not clear how ciliary dysfunc-tion results in such diverse phenotypes.87 Moreover , some ciliopathy genes display extensive allelism . For example , mutations in CEP290 are associated with MKS , JBTS , SLSN , LCA , and BBS.88 Although some CEP290 mutations may affect discrete functions or compromise activity to different degrees , other CEP290 mutations are associated with more than one ciliopathy , suggesting that modifier effects may account for the distinct resultant phenotypes.88,89 In support of the possibility that ciliary modifier loci have strong effects on expressivity , we observed that mouse B9d1 mutants with C57 Bl6 or mixed CD1-C57 Bl6 backgrounds displayed distinct phenotypes . It will be interesting to assess whether other B9D1 or B9D2 muta-tions underlie ciliopathies related to MKS , such as JBTS , and whether weaker alleles of B9 genes modify other cilio-pathies . A second possible explanation for the origins of different ciliopathy phenotypes is that different ciliogenic protein complexes have distinct functions , affecting ciliogenesis to different extents or in different tissues . In support of this possibility , B9 mutants display tissue-specific defects in ciliogenesis and ciliary protein mislocalization . For example , in mouse B9d1 mutants , cilia are absent in the node and neural tube , reduced in number and length in cystic kidneys , and present in bile ducts and MEFs . Simi-larly , in mouse Mks1 mutants , cilia are reduced in number and length in the node , limb buds , and neural tube , but not in lung airways and bile ducts.15 As in the mammalian bile duct , B9 proteins are not required for ciliogenesis in C. elegans , as shown by the fact that nematodes mutant for the orthologs of Mks1 , B9d1 , B9d2 , or a combination of all three do not display overt structural ciliary defects.11,12 The C. elegans orthologs of B9 proteins are , however , required for cilia-dependent sensory functions.12 Thus , B9 proteins are required for the formation of cilia in some tissues and organisms and are required for ciliary function in others . B9d1 is essential for the localization of a subset of ciliary proteins , so defects in ciliary protein composition are likely to underlie some intercellular signaling abnormalities in mouse B9 mutants . The simi-larity of mouse Mks1 and B9d1 mutant phenotypes to human MKS suggests that MKS may be caused not by the absence of cilia , but by tissue-specific ciliary loss and dysfunction .

21788582	OBJECTIVE—To define cellular mechanisms by which B cells promote type 1 diabetes . RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS—The study measured Tnormally ype 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease caused by islet-reactive T cells that destroy insulin-producing b-cells . T-cell tolerance mechanisms prevent autoimmune diabetes in mice and humans 1,2 , and T cell–directed treatment with anti-CD3 monoclonal antibodies slows the loss of insulin pro-duction in the 1st year after diabetes diagnosis 3 . With the focus on T cells , the role of antibodies and B cells in type 1 diabetes etiopathogenesis is often neglected . A single clinical case of type 1 diabetes in a person with X-linked agammaglobulinemia indicates that type 1 diabetes can develop in the absence of antibodies and B cells 4 . However , antibodies to insulin and other islet antigens are predictive of subsequent type 1 diabetes 5 , and B cells are required for diabetes development in the nonobese diabetic NOD mouse model of type 1 diabetes 6–8 . A recent clinical trial of B-cell depletion with anti-CD20 in humans with newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes demonstrated a sig-nificant delay in further loss of insulin synthesis and established a role for B cells 9 , but how B cells contribute to type 1 diabetes pathology remains unclear . Better un-derstanding of mechanisms by which B cells can promote type 1 diabetes may improve the efficacy of interventions that target B cells . B cells may contribute to type 1 diabetes pathology by capturing and presenting autoantigens to islet-reactive CD4+ T cells 10–12 . The effect on CD4 T cells is partic-ularly relevant because B cells present captured antigens to CD4 cells via major histocompatibility complex MHC II molecules , and type 1 diabetes is strongly associated with particular HLA-DR haplotypes . However , an alterna-tive possibility is that B cells contribute to type 1 diabetes pathology by secreting autoantibodies . In humans , the high predictive value of anti-islet autoantibodies for progression to type 1 diabetes is well documented 13–17 . However , it remains unresolved whether or not autoantibodies are simply a biomarker of breakdown in T-cell tolerance 5 . Indirect evidence against a pathogenic role for autoanti-bodies comes from the decreased incidence of type 1 di-abetes in offspring of diabetic mothers compared with diabetic fathers , despite transmission of maternal anti-islet autoantibodies 18–20 . Paradoxical protection from diabetes in children with maternally derived islet-autoantibodies has been reported 21 , although this protection was not ob-served in children with the high-risk HLA-DR3 DR4-DQ8 genotype . This observation could indicate that the effects of anti-islet antibodies are influenced by underlying het-erogeneity in the efficiency of CD4 T–cell tolerance mech-anisms , which are affected by variability in MHC II antigen presentation . Only a few experimental studies have investigated whether or not secreted autoantibodies influence type 1 diabetes progression , and none have examined their in-fluence on cellular mechanisms of tolerance in islet-reactive CD4 T cells . In NOD mice , diabetes was reduced when maternal transmission of antibodies from NOD mothers was prevented 22,23 . It is not yet known whether these ma-ternal effects reflect transmission of anti-islet autoanti-bodies , antibodies against microbial flora , or changes in See accompanying commentary , p. 2020 . maternal transmission of microbial commensals them-selves . In one study , type 1 diabetes incidence in litters from NOD mothers clustered according to the titer of anti-insulin antibodies in the mother’s serum 24 however , in another study there was no correlation 25 . Supporting a pathogenic role for autoantibodies , NOD mice lacking different activating Fcg receptors were shown to be pro-tected from diabetes 26 . Also , passive transfer of rabbit or mouse antibodies against islet-expressed ovalbumin OVA has been shown to enhance activation of islet-reactive CD8+ T cells and break tolerance 27 . Hence , experimental studies are needed to directly investigate the effects of anti-islet autoantibodies on islet-specific CD4 T cells and how these may interact with inherited defects in islet-specific CD4 T–cell tolerance . Here we find that anti-islet autoantibodies are potent cofactors in type 1 di-abetes progression and not simply markers of breakdown in CD4+ T–cell tolerance . RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Production of anti-HEL and anti-OVA immune serum or IgG . HEL - Injections of serum , purified IgG , or monoclonal antibodies . Neonates RESULTS Accelerated diabetes in Roquinsan san TCR+HEL+ mice . A point mutation in the Roquin gene Rc3h1 , Roquinsan exaggerates inducible T-cell costimulator ex-pression and formation of T follicular helper Tfh cells , and causes systemic autoimmunity 36,37 . To investigate its effect on islet-specific CD4 T–cell tolerance mecha-nisms , Roquinsan mice were crossed with TCR+HEL+ double-transgenic mice that have an increased frequency of islet-reactive CD4+ T cells . The HEL transgene encodes HEL under the insulin gene promoter , and mirrors the pattern of insulin expression with high expression in islet b-cells , nanomolar concentrations in serum , and Aire-dependent expression in thymic medullary epithelial cells 29,38 . The TCR transgene encodes the T-cell receptor from clone 3A9 , which recognizes a dominant HEL peptide 46–61 presented by I-Ak 28 . The resulting TCR+HEL+ mice make it possible to mea-sure cellular mechanisms of CD4 T–cell tolerance . They are , on the one hand , an experimentally contrived model be-cause of their increased thymic production of islet-reactive CD4+ T cells recognizing a single , experimentally expressed autoantigen that mirrors but may not exactly replicate in-sulin itself . On the other hand , only 20 % of TCR+HEL+ animals progress to b-cell destruction and diabetes on the diabetes-resistant B10BR strain background due to the combined action of thymic deletion , Treg function , and pe-ripheral anergy . Perturbations found to precipitate diabetes in TCR+HEL+ mice—such as inherited defects in AIRE , Bim-induction , interleukin IL -2 signaling , and Cbl-b—have revealed cellular mechanisms that are highly relevant to human type 1 diabetes and to antigenically complex models such as the NOD mouse strain or the KDP rat strain , in which mechanisms regulating islet-reactive CD4 cells are difficult or impossible to measure 29,34,39–41 . Hence we used this model to investigate how dysregulated forma-tion of Tfh cells affects the regulation of islet-reactive CD4 T cells . The Roquinsan mutation dramatically increased pro-gression to type 1 diabetes in TCR+HEL+ mice such that 100 % of Roquinsan san homozygotes developed diabetes by 8 weeks of age Fig. 1A . The median onset of type 1 di-abetes in these mice was earlier than TCR+HEL+ mice with mutations in Aire , Il2 or NOD non-MHC diabetes-susceptibility genes Fig. 1B 34,38,40 . The Roquinsan mutation had no discernable effect on thymic deletion of islet-reactive CD4 T cells bearing the 3A9 TCR TCRHEL Supplementary Fig. 1 , but the frequency of these cells was increased in the pancreatic lymph node PLN of Roquinsan san mice Fig. 1C and Supplementary Fig. 2 . TCRHEL+CD4+ cells from Roquinsan san mice divided extensively ex vivo in response to HEL not shown and produced elevated levels of g-interferon Fig. 1D and E , indicating that they were not anergic , unlike their coun-terparts from wild-type TCR+HEL+ mice 29 . There was no detectable increase in secreted IL-4 or IL-5 , suggesting that the islet-reactive cells in Roquinsan san TCR+HEL+ mice are predominantly Th1 cells . Thus , Roquinsan san TCR+HEL+ animals provide an experimental model of spontaneous , rapidly developing diabetes that stems from increased frequency of islet-reactive CD4 cells due to TCR and HEL transgenes and breakdown in peripheral toler-ance due to Roquin mutation . Roquinsan-accelerated diabetes requires B cells . B cells were of particular interest in the accelerated diabetes caused by the Roquinsan mutation because accumulation of Tfh cells causes spontaneous germinal centers and IgG auto-antibodies that characterize nontransgenic Roquinsan san mice 36,42 . Roquinsan san TCR+HEL+ mice had elevated Tfh cell frequencies in PLN compared with those in Roquinsan + TCR+HEL+ mice , which reached 10-fold when the heightened CD4+ T–cell frequency was taken into ac-count Fig. 2A . Germinal center B cells were also detec-ted at increased frequencies in PLN of Roquinsan san TCR+HEL+ mice Fig. 2B . Roquinsan san TCR+HEL+ mice examined 11 days after birth exhibited lymphocytic insulitis , whereas Roquin+ + TCR+HEL+ littermates did not Fig . 2C . Regardless of Roquin genotype , nearly all islets in adult TCR+HEL+ mice exhibited peri-insulitis or insulitis Fig. 2D , but focal to generalized exocrine pancreatitis was only observed in Roquinsan san mice Fig. 2D . Roquinsan san TCR+HEL+ mice also developed high titers of anti-HEL IgG autoantibodies in serum Fig. 3A , in-cluding antibodies of the IgG2a isotype Fig. 3B charac-teristic of Th1-driven immune responses . Autoantibody titers correlated with progression to diabetes in hetero-zygous Roquinsan + TCR+HEL+ mice Fig. 3A , and were characteristic of type 1 diabetes progression in Roquinsan san TCR+HEL+ mice , as high titers were not observed in diabetic TCR+HEL+ mice with mutations in Aire or Il-2 Fig. 3C . Remarkably , the diabetes incidence in Roquinsan san TCR+HEL+ mice rendered B cell deficient by a null mutation in Cd79a Cd79aken was no greater than in B cell–deficient Roquin+ + TCR+HEL+ mice Fig. 3D . Roquinsan san serum is sufficient to drive Roquinsan-accelerated diabetes , whereas intact B-cell antigen presentation is not . The requirement for B cells in Roquinsan-accelerated autoimmune diabetes could reflect the function of B cells acting as antigen-presenting cells or the function of secreted IgG autoantibodies . To investigate this , we generated Roquinsan san TCR+HEL+ mice in which high frequencies of B cells expressed HEL-specific IgM and IgD transgenes MD4 [ 30 ] . Surprisingly , inher-itance of IgMDHEL decreased the diabetes incidence in Roquinsan san TCR+HEL+ mice so that diabetes incidence was no greater than in Roquin+ + TCR+HEL+ mice Fig. 3E . This result demonstrates that intact antigen pre-sentation by B cells is not sufficient to drive Roquinsan-accelerated diabetes when the B cells can not secrete islet-specific IgG . Next , to test whether Roquinsan san serum was sufficient to trigger Roquinsan-accelerated diabetes , we transferred serum from diabetic Roquinsan san TCR+HEL+ mice or control serum pooled from diabetic Roquinsan + and Roquin+ + TCR+HEL+ mice into nondiabetic Roquinsan + TCR+HEL+ mice . Four of six recipients of Roquinsan san serum de-veloped diabetes within 25 days , whereas six recipients of the control serum remained nondiabetic Fig. 3F . Maternal transmission of anti-islet antibodies pro-motes diabetes in predisposed offspring . We also in - vestigated the role of anti-islet IgG in contexts other than the Roquinsan mutation . A unique feature of the breeding strategy used to produce the TCR+HEL+ animals repre-sented in Fig. 4 was that one parent was TCR+HEL+ and had previously developed diabetes that was cured by transplanting nontransgenic islets lacking the HEL auto-antigen . Once euglycemia was restored , the mouse was bred with a nontransgenic partner . Fifty-five percent of TCR+HEL+ offspring of diabetes-cured TCR+HEL+ mothers were diabetic by 150 days old , compared with 20 % of otherwise matched offspring of diabetes-cured fathers Fig. 4A . The increase in diabetes incidence occurred in both male and female offspring but was more se-vere in males Fig. 4B . This demonstrates that there is a naturally occurring diabetogenic factor that is trans-mitted from mother to offspring throughout the breeding life of a formerly diabetic mother . Furthermore , this ma-ternal factor discloses an unexpected sex dimorphism in susceptibility to diabetes in the TCR+HEL+ offspring . Anti-HEL IgG was present in the serum of diabetes-cured mothers around the time of transplantation and also .200 days after transplantation Fig. 4C , indicating that their offspring were open to vertical transmission of anti-HEL IgG 43 . To test whether a maternally transmitted cofactor could sensitize the offspring to diabetes in a setting where mothers were themselves diabetes free , wild-type non-transgenic females were immunized with HEL antigen in CFA to elicit HEL-specific IgG antibodies and then mated with TCR+HEL+ males Fig. 5A . The neonates had high titers of anti-HEL IgG , which declined by 70 days after birth , confirming their maternal origin Fig. 5B . All of the TCR+HEL+ offspring developed diabetes 3–6 weeks after birth , whereas littermates lacking either or both transgenes did not become diabetic Fig. 5C . Diabetes was not in-creased when the mothers were immunized with a control antigen OVA Fig. 5D . To determine whether anti-HEL IgG was sufficient to trigger diabetes , neonatal TCR+HEL+ mice from un-manipulated breeders were given serum , or in a separate experiment purified IgG , from mice immunized with HEL CFA . Diabetes developed at 3–4 weeks of age in all neo-nates receiving HEL-immune serum and by 15 days of age in neonates receiving purified anti-HEL IgG but not in controls receiving anti-OVA serum or IgG Fig. 5E and F . Anti-islet antibody acts through FcgR-bearing cells . That diabetes did not occur in HEL+ single-transgenic offspring suggests that the antibodies do not cause direct lysis of islets but rather act indirectly by enhancing the activation of islet-reactive CD4+ T cells . To test antibody-mediated effects on CD4+ cells , splenocytes from CD45.1 TCR+ transgenic donors were labeled with CFSE and injected into CD45.2 HEL+ or HEL– recipients . HEL+ recipients were given a course of injections of HEL-immune or control serum , and the fate of the HEL-specific T cells was tracked by flow cytometry of recipient spleen Fig. 6A using the ratio of donor CD4+ cells to donor B cells to normalize any mouse-to-mouse differences in the number of cells injected . Treatment of recipients with HEL-immune serum increased the numbers of HEL-reactive CD4+ cells present at days 3 , 5 , and 7 Fig . 6B and their CFSE dilution at each time-point analyzed Fig. 6C . To determine whether the HEL-immune serum enhances CD4+ cell proliferation and or survival , the experiment was repeated using donor splenocytes that were Bim-deficient and therefore resistant to cell death 32 . In-terestingly , although the Bim-deficient T cells were triggered to proliferate specifically in the HEL+ recipients as expected , CFSE dilution within Bim-deficient T cells was equivalent regardless of whether mice were treated with HEL-immune or control serum Fig. 6D . This sug-gests that HEL-immune serum does not enhance cell pro-liferation , but rather it inhibits the death of cells that have proliferated . Antibody-mediated activation of T cells would appear to occur through antigen-presenting cells expressing recep-tors for the Fc portion of IgG FcgR , given that CD4+ T cells themselves do not express FcgR . To test this , we FIG. 5 . Effect of passive transfer of antibody on diabetes in TCR+ HEL+ mice . A Breeding strategy for maternal antibody transfer experiments . Nontransgenic B10.BR females were immunized with HEL or OVA protein emulsified in CFA to induce specific antibodies and then mated with TCR+HEL+ males to yield 25 % TCR+HEL+ offspring and equal numbers of singly transgenic or nontransgenic littermates . B Anti-HEL IgG titers in newborns from mothers immunized as illustrated in A 70-day-old pups from immunized or unimmunized mothers and mothers 5 weeks after immunization . C Diabetes incidence in offspring with the indicated genotypes bred from HEL-immunized mothers . D Diabetes incidence in TCR+HEL+ offspring of mothers immunized with either HEL closed symbols or OVA open symbols . E and F Diabetes in-cidence in TCR+HEL+ neonates injected on days 1 , 3 , and 5 after birth with serum E or purified IgG F from HEL-or OVA-immunized mice . injected neonates with three doses of anti-HEL serum on days 2 , 4 , and 6 after birth and either a monoclonal FcgR-blocking antibody or rat IgG2b isotype control on days 1 , 3 , and 5 and twice a week thereafter until day 17 . FcgR blockade delayed the onset and reduced the incidence of diabetes Fig. 6E . Thus , in the presence of islet-reactive CD4 T cells , anti-islet autoantibodies trigger diabetes via a mechanism that requires antibody recognition by FcgR+ cells . DISCUSSION Here we study the role of B cells in type 1 diabetes and show that anti-islet IgG autoantibodies accelerate CD4 T cell–driven diabetes . The anti-islet antibodies were in-sufficient to precipitate diabetes on their own , arguing against a direct antibody-mediated destruction of b-cells . Instead , they acted in an FcgR-mediated manner to enhance accumulation of islet-reactive CD4+ T cells and promote diabetes in animals that were genetically predisposed be-cause of increased frequency of islet-reactive CD4+ T cells . The accelerated progression to type 1 diabetes in Roquinsan TCR+HEL+ animals with high-titer anti-islet antibodies demonstrates a principle of positive feedback between dys-regulation of autoreactive helper T cells and the resulting autoantibodies . Although the experimental evidence that B cells con-tribute to diabetes induction in NOD mice is strong , whether autoantibodies play a prominent role is unclear . Evidence for a contribution by autoantibodies came from reports of diabetes suppression when maternal antibody transfer was abrogated 22,23 . New data have raised the question of whether the epigenetic factor is islet-specific autoantibody transmitted from mother to offspring or al-tered colonization of the offspring by microbial commen-sals whose interaction with the innate immune system influences diabetes incidence in NOD mice 44 . Further-more , maternal hyperglycemia can perturb fetal islet de-velopment 45 , which could affect tolerance to the islets . Evidence against a role for antibodies came from the ob-servation that fortnightly injections of 70 mg purified Ig from diabetic NOD mice could not induce diabetes in B cell–deficient NOD.Ighmnull mice 10 , although it is pos-sible that the concentration of active antibody achieved was suboptimal . Furthermore , anti-insulin VH IgM trans-gene VH125Tg restored diabetes in NOD.Ighmnull mice in the absence of measurable anti-insulin antibodies 12 . Given the lack of diabetes enhancement observed here with an anti-HEL IgM transgene and dramatic enhancement by anti-HEL IgG antibody , these collective experimental find-ings imply that antigen presentation by islet-specific B cells and secretion of anti-islet IgG may both serve as positive feedbacks compounding the dysregulation of islet-reactive T cells but with varying significance in different individuals . Cross-presentation of islet autoantigen by dendritic cells DCs to islet-specific CD8+ cells was enhanced by coinfu-sion of rabbit anti-islet antibodies , and this promoted di-abetes 27 . Our results reinforce and complement these findings by demonstrating that spontaneously produced anti-islet autoantibodies , either made by the animal itself or passively transferred as maternal antibody , can over-come thymic and peripheral tolerance mechanisms to trigger CD4+ cell–mediated autoimmune diabetes in an FcgR-dependent manner . Although the inhibition of HEL-immune serum-induced diabetes by anti-FcgR 2.4G2 re-veals a crucial role for FcgRs , the specific FcgR+ cell types that are pivotal in unleashing the autoimmune cascade re-main unclear . 2.4G2 binds to both the inhibitory FcgRIIb CD32 and the activatory FcgRIII CD16 molecules 46 , but its immunosuppressive effect is presumably due to its binding to FcgRIII . Blockade of FcgRIII expressed by antigen-presenting cells would inhibit the uptake of antigen-antibody complexes and would prevent antigen-presenting cell maturation , but the blockade may also inhibit the ac-tivation of immune effector cells such as macrophages , natural killer cells , and granulocytes 47 . Indeed , rein-stating FcgR+ cells in either the afferent purified DCs or the efferent purified natural killer cells arm of the im-mune response was sufficient to increase diabetes in NOD mice lacking the FcR common g chain 26 . Although we can not exclude a direct action on effector cells , increased autoantigen uptake by and maturation of DCs is likely to underlie the enhancement of islet-specific CD4+ T–cell survival by HEL-immune serum . The role of B cells and autoantibodies in human type 1 diabetes is complex and poorly understood because al-though anti-islet autoantibodies are the best current pre-dictors of future type 1 diabetes , the observational studies that followed multiple cohorts of subjects with either mothers or fathers with type 1 diabetes have revealed par-adoxical protection associated with transmission of anti-islet autoantibodies—albeit dependent on HLA-DR status . Genome-wide association studies and studies of HLA poly-morphisms indicate that the pathogenesis of human type 1 diabetes is likely to be heterogeneous , and hence it is conceivable that the diabetes-promoting role of B cells and anti-islet antibodies may not be uniform . Islet autoanti-bodies may be active cofactors in human type 1 diabetes pathogenesis once islet-reactive CD4+ T cells have escaped thymic or peripheral tolerance . In our transgenic mouse studies , this occurs congenitally because of the high fre-quency of islet-specific CD4 cells formed in the thymus even before birth , whereas it may only occur years after birth in humans , for example because of inherited gene variants of HLA-DR , CTLA4 , or AIRE . The findings here , by defining mechanisms by which anti-islet IgG autoanti-bodies cooperate with incomplete thymic deletion to pro-mote clonal expansion of islet-reactive CD4 T cells in vivo and progression to diabetes , provide an experimental foundation for future studies in humans and more complex rodent models where it is more difficult to trace the reg-ulation of islet-specific CD4 cells . The FcgR-blocking study also shows that inhibiting im-mune complex recognition by FcgR+ cells is attractive as a therapy . The first B cell–depleting trials with rituximab rituxan , monoclonal CD20-specific antibody in type 1 diabetes have reported responsiveness to therapy broadly comparable with anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody , high-lighting an important role for B cells or antibody in type 1 diabetes in humans 9 . Rituximab is highly effective in depleting recirculating and memory B cells and causes a rapid decrease in autoantibodies in a number of auto-immune diseases 48 , although its effect on anti-islet anti-bodies in the recent phase 2 clinical trial was not described . Our study provides experimental evidence that it will be valuable both to measure anti-islet antibodies as an internal surrogate end point and pathogenic cofactor in future B cell–depleting trials , and to investigate clinical interventions that more specifically target autoantibody secretion or its effects on T-cell activation .

21810592	RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS—Diabetes was induced using streptozotocin STZ in human apoE3 E3 or human apoE4 E4 mice deficient in the LDL receptor LDLR2 2 . Cmortality ardiovascular disease CVD caused by a wors-ening of atherosclerosis is an important com-plication of diabetes and is the leading cause of among patients with diabetes 1 . Patients with poorly managed type 1 diabetes or type 2 di-abetes commonly have elevated VLDL triglycerides TGs , a reduction of HDL cholesterol , and smaller , dense LDL . This common cluster of harmful changes in lipid metabo-lism is referred to as diabetic dyslipidemia 2 . Apolipoprotein E apoE is a small circulating protein associated predominantly with VLDL and HDL . It is the primary ligand for several lipoprotein receptors , making it a crucial component in the clearance of lipid from the circulation and a major determinant of plasma cholesterol and CVD risk 3 . In humans , the APOE gene is polymorphic , resulting in production of three common isoforms apoE2 , apoE3 , and apoE4 . The apoE4 isoform is carried by more than a quarter 28 % of the U.S. population and is associ-ated with higher LDL cholesterol and an increased risk of CVD 3 . In addition to its well-established role in CVD , recent findings have implicated a role for apoE in glucose metabolism . Epidemiological studies have suggested that in certain populations , APOE genotype may influence plasma glucose and insulin levels 4,5 , postprandial glu-cose response 6 , the development of metabolic syn-drome 7,8 , and a myriad of diabetes complications 9 . In addition , apoE4 carriers with diabetes have been shown to have increased carotid atherosclerosis 10 , and elderly apoE4 carriers with diabetes have an increased risk of CVD-associated death 11 . Increases in VLDL TGs decreases in HDL the accu-mulation of smaller , more dense LDL slower clearance of postprandial chylomicrons and a decrease in LDL re-ceptor LDLR expression are all noted phenotypes asso-ciated with both type 1 and type 2 diabetes 2 . All of these components of diabetic dyslipidemia are areas of normal lipid metabolism in which apoE has previously been shown to play a direct role . The major receptor through which apoE mediates lipoprotein clearance is the LDLR , and the apoE isoforms exhibit differential LDLR binding affinities 12 . Therefore , we sought whether apoE iso-forms retain differential roles in diabetic dyslipidemia and atherosclerosis in the absence of the LDLR by using a mouse model of diabetes induced by streptozotocin STZ . In this study , we show that dyslipidemia and atheroscle-rosis are greatly exaggerated in diabetic LDLR2 2 mice expressing human apoE4 E4LDLR2 2 compared with those with human apoE3 E3LDLR2 2 , despite a similar degree of hyperglycemia . This E4-specific aggravation of diabetic dyslipidemia is central to the liver and is associated with a reduction in hepatic lipid oxidation , an accumulation of liver TGs , and increased rates of VLDL secretion . RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Lipid and glucose uptake , de novo lipogenesis , and oxidation . Primary RESULTS Induction of diabetes . E3LDLR2 2 and E4LDLR2 2 mice had indistinguishable plasma glucose levels at the begin-ning and at the end of the study Fig. 1A and Table 1 . They showed a similar response rate to STZ , with 86.4 and 84.6 % of injected E3LDLR2 2 and E4LDLR2 2 mice becoming diabetic . One month after STZ injection , average plasma glucose levels of E3LDLR2 2 and E4LDLR2 2 mice reached 424 6 30 and 407 6 44 mg dL , respectively , and remained .400 mg dL for the 3-month study period Fig. 1A and Table 1 . Plasma insulin levels in both genotypes dropped severely Fig. 1B . The severity of diabetes was also comparable between the two diabetic groups as estimated by plasma levels of ketone bodies , daily food intake , and urine excretion Table 1 . Diabetic dyslipidemia . Nondiabetic E3LDLR2 2 and E4LDLR2 2 mice had similar total plasma cholesterol and TGs Fig. 2A and B as well as similar lipoprotein distri-bution profiles Fig. 2C and D . While the induction of di-abetes led to increases in total cholesterol and total TGs in both E3LDLR2 2 and E4LDLR2 2 mice as early as 1 month after STZ administration , the increase in plasma choles-terol was significant only in E4LDLR2 2 mice when com-pared with their nondiabetic counterparts . Most important , plasma cholesterol and TGs in the diabetic E4LDLR2 2 mice were significantly higher than those in diabetic E3LDLR2 2 mice at 1 and 3 months of diabetes Fig. 2A and B . VLDL and LDL cholesterol , as well as VLDL TGs , in-creased in both genotypes after STZ administration Fig. 2E and F . However , VLDL TGs and LDL cholesterol were both twofold higher in E4LDLR2 2 mice than in E3LDLR2 2 mice Fig. 2E and F . Consequently , the LDL-to-HDL ratio , an established risk factor for atherosclerosis , was 2.2-fold higher in diabetic E4LDLR2 2 mice than in diabetic E3LDLR2 2 FIG. 1 . Induction of diabetes . A Fasting plasma glucose of nondiabetic E3LDLR2 2 and nondiabetic E4LDLR2 2 mice and after injection of STZ in diabetic E3LDLR2 2 and diabetic E4LDLR2 2 mice n 8–12 per group . B Fasting plasma insulin , as determined by ELISA . **P 0.01 . TABLE 1 mice . Given that the diet provided was low in fat and cho-lesterol , food consumption did not differ between the two diabetic groups Table 1 the enhanced hyperlipidemia in E4LDLR2 2 is independent of dietary lipid intake . VLDL fractionated from plasma by sequential ultracen-trifugation had a similar composition of cholesterol , TGs , and phospholipids Supplementary Fig. 1A . Diabetes in-duced a 5 and 26 % increase in apoB100 and a 10 and 57 % increase in apoB48 in E3LDLR2 2 and E4LDLR2 2 mice , respectively . Although total amounts of apoB100 and apoB48 are 30 % more in the diabetic E4LDLR2 2 mice compared with diabetic E3LDLR2 2 mice , their distribu-tions among different classes of lipoproteins were not sig-nificantly altered Supplementary Fig. 1B–E . In a similar manner , the amount of total plasma apoA1 did not differ by apoE genotype Supplementary Fig. 1F and G . Diabetic E3LDLR2 2 and diabetic E4LDLR2 2 mice had similar lipo-protein distributions of apoE Supplementary Fig. 2A and B and apoCIII-to-apoE ratios , an important marker of lipolysis and uptake Supplementary Fig. 2C . Rates of lipolysis were also similar between VLDL isolated from diabetic E3LDLR2 2 or diabetic E4LDLR2 2 mice Supplementary Fig. 2D , suggesting similar rates of VLDL conversion be-tween the two diabetic groups . In addition , the degree of glycation in the VLDL-LDL fractions was similar in all groups Table 1 . In summary , diabetic E4LDLR2 2 mice develop a far more deleterious plasma lipid and lipoprotein distribution profile than diabetic E3LDLR2 2 mice , characterized by a substantial increase in the total amount of circulating lipoproteins , although not in the composition of the lipo-protein particles themselves . Lipoprotein clearance and postprandial fat tolerance . As the model used lacks the LDLR , we measured the ex-pression of several other genes involved in lipoprotein up-take . The expression of apoE , LDLR related protein 1 LRP1 , scavenger receptor B type 1 SR-B1 , and N-deacetylase N-sulfotransferase 1 NDST1 did not differ significantly between the two diabetic groups nor by induction of diabetes Fig. 3A . Gene expression of VLDL receptor VLDLR was increased approximately eightfold by STZ administration , but the difference between diabetic E3LDLR2 2 and E4LDLR2 2 mice was not significant . We next measured the efficiency of VLDL clearance in diabetic E3LDLR2 2 and diabetic E4LDLR2 2 mice by in-jecting VLDL isolated from apoE-deficient mice and labeled with DiI . There was no difference in the fractional catabo-lism of VLDL between the two diabetic groups Fig. 3B . In a similar manner , there was no difference in the clearance of LDL particles isolated from nondiabetic LDLR2 2 mice Fig. 3C . We also examined whether the lipoprotein par-ticles from diabetic mice with apoE3 or apoE4 are cleared differently by injecting nondiabetic LDLR2 2 recipients of 125I-labeled VLDL or LDL isolated from diabetic E3LDLR2 2 or diabetic E4LDLR2 2 mice . There was no difference in their clearance Supplementary Fig. 3A and B . These data demonstrate that the clearance of VLDL remnants and LDL are not the major cause of the enhanced diabetic dyslip-idemia observed in E4LDLR2 2 mice compared with E3LDLR2 2 mice . Plasma TG levels in the diabetic E4LDLR2 2 mice dropped to similar levels in E3LDLR2 2 mice after an overnight fast . After administration of an oral gavage of olive oil to the di-abetic mice , however , plasma TG levels of the E4LDLR2 2 mice quickly reestablished a level twofold higher than E3LDLR2 2 mice and remained high at all points post-gavage Fig. 3D . Except for the initial increase , clear-ance appeared to be equally impaired in the two groups , suggesting that diabetes is affecting postprandial lipid clearance equally . Intestinal absorption assessed by olive oil gavage after Tyloxapol injection did not differ by apoE genotype Supplementary Fig. 4 . VLDL secretion . Altered hepatic VLDL secretion is a pos-sible contributing factor to the elevated plasma lipids in the diabetic E4LDLR2 2 mice . Thus , we measured plasma ac-cumulation of TGs as a marker of VLDL secretion . After inhibition of VLDL uptake and lipolysis by injection of the detergent Tyloxapol , the TG secretion rate in nondiabetic E3LDLR2 2 and E4LDLR2 2 mice was similar , averaging 3.2 6 0.5 and 4.0 6 0.4 mg dL min TGs , respectively Fig. 3E . The secretion rate in the diabetic E3LDLR2 2 mice did not differ significantly from those of nondiabetic animals , averaging 3.5 6 0.6 mg dL min TGs . In contrast , the secre-tion rate in the diabetic E4LDLR2 2 mice was significantly elevated , averaging 7.0 6 0.5 mg dL min and reaching a mean plasma TG level of 1,431.3 6 49.3 mg dL 2 h after Tyloxapol injection Fig. 3E . Energy usage , hepatic lipid stores , and fatty acid metabolism . To assess global energy metabolism in the diabetic E3LDLR2 2 and E4LDLR2 2 mice , indirect calo-rimetry analysis was performed . Diabetic E4LDLR2 2 mice had significantly higher daily respiratory exchange ratios RERs VCO2 VO2 , particularly during the light cycle , than E3LDLR2 2 mice Fig. 4A and B . This difference in RER was not because of altered activity data not shown . A higher average RER in the diabetic LDLR2 2 mice with E4 0.915 6 0.003 compared with those with E3 0.896 6 0.004 , P , 0.01 during the light cycle indicates that the presence of apoE4 results in a lower fractional reliance on lipid as an energy source . Nondiabetic E3LDLR2 2 and E4LDLR2 2 mice had similar TG stores in the liver . It is interesting that diabetes induced a significant accumulation of hepatic TGs only in E4LDLR2 2 mice , because they store twice as much as diabetic E3LDLR2 2 mice Fig. 4C . This increase was not sufficient to cause overt steatosis , and there were no no-table histological abnormalities in the livers of the diabetic mice data not shown . The increase in hepatic TG storage in E4LDLR2 2 mice during diabetes was also associated with an increase in plasma FFAs Table 1 . Diabetes increased hepatic gene expression of SREBP1c and FOXO1 , regulators of lipogenesis and VLDL secretion , respectively . Both tended to be higher in diabetic E4LDLR2 2 mice compared with diabetic E3LDLR2 2 mice , but the increase did not reach significance Fig. 4D . Expression of genes for SREBP2 , ChREBP , PPAR-a , and CPT1 did not alter significantly between the two genotypes . It is important that expression of fatty acid synthase decreased signifi-cantly in E3LDLR2 2 livers after STZ administration while remaining elevated in diabetic E4LDLR2 2 livers Fig. 4D . Although protein levels of AMPK and pAMPK were similar , a significantly lower pACC-to-ACC ratio was noted in livers isolated from diabetic E4LDLR2 2 mice compared with E3LDLR2 2 livers Fig. 4E and F . Total ACC also tended to be lower but did not reach significance . A lower pACC-to-ACC ratio is indicative of decreased fatty acid oxidation and increased fatty acid synthesis . Together , these data suggest that increased fatty acid synthesis and reduced fatty acid oxidation underlie an accumulation of lipid stores in the livers of diabetic E4LDLR2 2 mice . Glucose and lipid metabolism in primary hepatocytes . To verify a decrease in fatty acid oxidation in the livers of diabetic E4LDLR2 2 mice , primary hepatocytes were isolated and cultured for 72 h in high 25 mmol L glucose medium to mimic the hyperglycemic environment of diabetes . Control cells were incubated in low glucose 5 mmol L for the same period . Similar to the TG accu-mulation noted in the liver in vivo , primary hepatocytes harvested from E4LDLR2 2 mice and cultured in high glucose accumulated more lipid than E3LDLR2 2 cells Fig. 5A and B . The total area of lipid per cell was two-fold higher in cells expressing E4 than E3 16.6 6 1.9 and 7.7 6 0.6 mm2 cell , respectively Fig. 5B . FFA uptake , measured using [ 14C ] palmitic acid , increased in hepatocytes cultured in the high glucose medium but was not affected by apoE isoform Fig. 5C . In a similar manner , there was no apoE isoform effect on the cellular uptake of glucose Fig. 5D . The rate of DNL , defined here as 14C in-corporation into the lipid layer in cells cultured in the presence of [ 14C ] glucose , was higher in hepatocytes cul-tured in high glucose medium than those cultured in low glucose medium . However , hepatocytes isolated from E3LDLR2 2 and E4LDLR2 2 mice did not differ in their rate of DNL in either the low or high glucose environment Fig. 5E . We next examined the rates of glucose and lipid oxi-dation in the E3LDLR2 2 and E4LDLR2 2 hepatocytes . Three days in high glucose medium decreased rates of [ 14C ] glucose oxidation in both E3LDLR2 2 and E4LDLR2 2 hepatocytes . However , there was no significant difference in glucose utilization between them Fig. 5F . Finally , we measured lipid oxidation in primary hepatocytes cultured in high or low glucose using [ 14C ] palmitic acid . E3LDLR2 2 and E4LDLR2 2 hepatocytes cultured in the low glucose media demonstrated similar rates of lipid oxidation . When cultured in the high glucose environment , however , there was a striking downregulation of lipid oxidation only in E4LDLR2 2 hepatocytes Fig. 5G . After 72 h in the high glucose condition , the E4LDLR2 2 hepatocytes had lipid oxidation rates 40 % of those in the E3LDLR2 2 hepatocytes . Diabetic atherosclerosis . Reflecting their severe dys-lipidemia , diabetic LDLR2 2 mice carrying the E4 allele had aortic plaques on average threefold greater in area than those with E3 Fig. 6 . The size of the atherosclerotic plaques in diabetic E4LDLR2 2 mice 141,000 6 19,000 mm2 was significantly greater when compared with diabetic E3LDLR2 2 mice 48,000 6 9,000 mm2 as well as to both nondiabetic E3LDLR2 2 and nondiabetic E4LDLR2 2 mice 32,000 6 8,000 and 40,000 6 12,000 mm2 Fig. 6 . While diabetic E4LDLR2 2 mice had larger and more complex atherosclerotic lesions than diabetic E3LDLR2 2 mice , the number of macrophages Supplementary Fig. 5A and B and apoptotic cells Supplementary Fig. 5C and D per lesion area were similar between the two groups . DISCUSSION In the present work , we explored the isoform-specific role of apoE in diabetic dyslipidemia using diabetic LDLR2 2 mice with human apoE4 or apoE3 . We found that 1 nondiabetic E3LDLR2 2 and E4LDLR2 2 mice are in-distinguishable in all parameters of glucose and lipid me-tabolism measured in this study 2 after induction of diabetes , E4LDLR2 2 mice , but not E3LDLR2 2 , develop enhanced dyslipidemia , characterized by elevated VLDL TG and LDL cholesterol , and an increased rate of VLDL secretion 3 the severe dyslipidemia in diabetic E4LDLR2 2 mice is associated with larger hepatic lipid stores and a calorimetric profile suggestive of lower lipid utilization 4 primary hepatocytes isolated from E4LDLR2 2 mice and cultured in high glucose accumulated more intracellular lipid concomitant with a reduction in fatty acid oxidation and 5 these metabolic disturbances during diabetes culminated in exaggerated atherosclerosis only in E4LDLR2 2 mice . Diabetic dyslipidemia in poorly treated type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes shares many features 2 . In many patients with diabetes , the levels of circulating lipoproteins during fasting are relatively normal 21 . Instead , the major impairments to lipoprotein metabolism occur with their ability to clear postprandial lipoproteins 2 . The prolonged elevation of plasma TGs after a fatty meal has been dem-onstrated in individuals carrying the E4 allele 6 , and our previous work demonstrated postprandial lipemia in LDLR overexpressing mice with human apoE4 22 . Previously , Goldberg et al. 23 showed that STZ-induced diabetic LDLR2 2 mice accumulated a “subclass of lipoproteins” that normally is quickly removed from the circulation . Our experiments confirmed that postprandial lipid clearance is impaired in diabetic LDLR2 2 mice . However , except for initial increase in plasma TG in E4LDLR2 2 mice , the postprandial clearance rate was not different in two groups . In addition , we found no APOE genotype effect on the fractional catabolism of either VLDL or LDL . VLDL production is increased in type 2 diabetes and in uncontrolled type 1 diabetes 2 . In insulin-resistant patients , this increased VLDL production is oftentimes part of a dys-lipidemic cycle in which larger adipose tissue stores are associated with increased FFA release 24 . In turn , an in-creased flux of FFA to the liver stimulates VLDL secretion 25 . The FFA-stimulated VLDL production is compounded in an insulin-resistant or insulin-deficient state 2 . Along these lines , the increased plasma VLDL in the diabetic E4LDLR2 2 mice is accompanied by a twofold increase in TG secretion . In comparison , TG secretion in the diabetic E3LDLR2 2 mice was not different from that in the non-diabetic controls . In a similar manner , LDLR2 2 mice expressing murine apoE do not have increased rates of TG production after STZ-induced diabetes 23 . We note that increased hepatic secretion of TG-rich particles is most likely responsible for the majority of LDL-sized particles in E4LDLR2 2 mice , since absence of LDLR has been shown to result in overproduction of TG-rich par-ticles smaller than normal VLDL 26,27 . Thus , the dys-lipidemic cycle commonly seen in patients with insulin resistance is reflected by the insulin-deficient E4LDLR2 2 mice used in this study , which have higher circulating FFA , larger hepatic TG stores , and higher rates of TG secretion than diabetic E3LDLR2 2 mice . Indirect calorimetry analysis revealed a clear apoE ge-notype effect on energy usage during diabetes at the whole body level . Diabetic E4LDLR2 2 mice had significantly higher RER , demonstrating a lower ratio of lipid-to-carbohydrate oxidation compared with diabetic E3LDLR2 2 mice during the light cycle . This reduced reliance on lipid oxidation appears to be central to the liver and directed by ACC signaling . When active , ACC catalyzes the production of malonyl-CoA , thereby stimulating lipogenesis and inhib-iting the b-oxidation of fatty acids 28 . A significant re-duction in the pACC-to-ACC ratio in the livers of diabetic E4LDLR2 2 mice indicates an increase in lipogenesis and decrease in fatty acid oxidation . In addition , STZ adminis-tration decreased FASN gene expression in the E3LDLR2 2 mice , as previously reported in wild-type mice 29 . How-ever , this diabetes-induced reduction did not occur in E4LDLR2 2 mice , suggesting a higher rate of fatty acid synthesis in these mice . Higher expression of FASN was not the result of stimulation by ChREBP . Expression of SREBP1c , an important regulator of FASN-directed lipogenesis , on the other hand , tended to be higher in the diabetic E4LDLR2 2 livers but did not reach significance . Regardless , these data point toward two distinct means metabolically linked by ACC signaling by which lipid accumulates in the E4LDLR2 2 livers during diabetes— an increase in fatty acid synthesis and a reduction in fatty acid oxidation . Consistent with these data , apoE4-expressing LDLR2 2 hepatocytes cultured in high glucose reduced their rate of lipid oxidation to levels 40 % of that in E3LDLR2 2 hepatocytes and amassed more than twice as much lipid . FIG. 6 . Atherosclerosis at the aortic root . A–D Cross sections of the aortic root were stained with hematoxylin-eosin and Oil Red O. Photos are representative of the mean plaque size of nondiabetic E3LDLR2 2 A , nondiabetic E4LDLR2 2 B , diabetic E3LDLR2 2 C , and diabetic E4LDLR2 2 mice D . E Data points represent the average lesion area of four distinct histological sections of the aortic root n 9–12 per group . **P 0.01 . A high-quality digital representation of this figure is available in the online issue . LDLR2 2 mice are an established model for high-fat diet–induced obesity and insulin resistance , and we have previously shown that mice expressing apoE4 are more susceptible to diet-induced glucose intolerance than those expressing apoE3 30 . This propensity of apoE4-expressing mice to develop glucose intolerance likely contributes to the impaired lipid metabolism in the insulin-deficient state . In this context , we note that VLDLR mRNA was significantly increased after the STZ administration , and the mRNA levels tended to be higher in the diabetic E4LDLR2 2 livers than in the diabetic E3LDLR2 2 livers . While the contribution of VLDLR in hepatic remnant clearance during diabetes is not clear , fasting hyper-triglyceridemia in VLDLR2 2 mice has been previously noted 31 , and when overexpressed in the liver , VLDLR appears to function similarly to LDLR and LRP 32 . The VLDLR plays an important role in adipocyte TG accumula-tion 33 and could be a potential player in the process of hepatic lipid accumulation during diabetes . Our results support the possibility that apoE functions as a metabolic signaling molecule outside its established role in lipoprotein clearance . For example , a role for apoE as a signaling molecule has been shown previously in the context of Alzheimer disease 34 , where it has been shown to affect activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 2 and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase in an apoE isoform–specific manner 35 . Similar apoE4-specific sig-naling could account for some of the metabolic abnor-malities during diabetes highlighted in this study . Alternatively , apoE has been shown to enhance VLDL secretion 36 , as well as play a role in the accumulation of lipid in early and intermediary secretory compartments of hepatocytes 37 . Thus , inefficient recycling and rese-cretion of apoE4 38 could potentially affect the avail-ability , packaging , and or transport of TG from the hepatic lipid pool . Irrespective of the precise mode of action , our results demonstrate a possible chain of events in diabetic E4LDLR2 2 livers a downregulation of lipid oxidation and upregulation of fatty acid synthesis lead to larger hepatic TG stores , which in turn drive an increase in VLDL secretion . Combined with marked diabetic effects that impair VLDL and postprandial TG clearance , these processes are ultimately responsible for the severe dyslipidemia observed in the diabetic E4LDLR2 2 mice . It is important that the diabetes-induced acceleration of atherosclerosis occurs only in LDLR2 2 mice expressing apoE4 . Previous studies of STZ-induced diabetes in LDLR2 2 mice have produced variable results , with some groups showing an increase in atherosclerosis 39,40 while others show no change 41,42 . Although the rea-sons for these mixed results are unknown , varying ex-perimental conditions , such as diet , could contribute 43 . The E4-specific acceleration of atherosclerosis is likely a direct result of the severe dyslipidemia brought about by STZ-induced diabetes in these mice , although con-tributions of other factors , such as apoE4-specific effects on macrophages , can not be excluded 44 . Regardless , our data clearly demonstrate the presence of E4 effects that are independent of the LDLR . Moreover , the exag-gerated dyslipidemia and atherosclerosis observed in the diabetic E4LDLR2 2 mice extends beyond the scope of type 1 diabetes and has implications for the growing number of apoE4 carriers with insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes . In conclusion , the apoE4-specific atheroscle-rosis and diabetic dyslipidemia illustrated in this study may also play an important role in patients with diabetes who carry the apoE4 isoform .

21820096	Adams-Oliver syndrome AOS [ MIM 100300 ] is a multiple congenital anomaly syndrome that is characterized by aplasia cutis congenita ACC as well as terminal trans-verse limb defects TTLD in addition to variable involve-ment of the brain , eyes , and cardiovascular system.1–3 Original epidemiological data were consistent with a domi-nant mode of inheritance due to presumed de novo in simplex cases or familial in multiplex families muta-tions . Horizontal transmission was initially suspected as possible germline mosaicism , but multiple reports of recur-rence in consanguineous unions made it likely that AOS can also occur as an autosomal-recessive trait.3 The classic combination of ACC and TTLD and their known association with vascular anomalies fueled specula-tion that vascular disruption is a major pathogenic mech-anism in AOS.2,4 However , recently dominant mutations were found to cause AOS by virtue of Rac1 MIM 602048 and Cdc42 MIM 116952 inactivation , which leads to impaired actin cytoskeletal homeostasis.5 ARHGAP31 is a GTPase-activating protein GAP that stimulates the intrinsic GTPase activity of Rac1 and Cdc42 and thus replaces their active GTP-bound form with the inactive GDP-bound form.6 The two reported mutations in ARHGAP31 MIM 610911 were hypermorphic in nature , causing sustained inactivation of Rac1 and Cdc42 , which are known to be of critical importance in regulating the actin cytoskeleton.7 As a result , AOS appears to be a member of a growing list of actin cytoskeletopathies that includes such disparate disorders as Lowe Oculocerebrore - nalsyndrome OCRL [ MIM 309000 ] , Nemaline Myopathy NEM [ MIM 609284 , 256030 , 161800 , 609285 , and 605355 ] and Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome WASF [ MIM 605035 , 605875 , and 605068 ] .8–10 In our effort to molecularly characterize AOS in our inbred population , where autosomal-recessive AOS is seen more commonly , 11 we have studied two unrelated individuals who have this syndrome and were born to consanguineous parents . We successfully combined auto-zygome analysis with exome data in one of these two indi-viduals to identify a loss-of-function mutation in DOCK6 , another modulator of Cdc42 and Rac1 , and we then iden-tified a second mutation in the other individual . Our data on Dock6 expression and the cellular phenotype of fibro-blasts of individual 1 further confirm the role of DOCK6 in AOS pathogenesis , which appears to converge with that reported for ARHGAP31 in perturbation of the actin cytoskeleton through inactivation of Cdc42 and Rac1 . Individual 1 is an 11-month-old girl born to first-cousin Arab parents and who was referred for clinical genetics evaluation . She has four normal siblings and a cousin who is said to be similarly affected but who was unavail-able for evaluation Figure 1A . Pregnancy was uncompli-cated . Abnormal hands and feet were noted at birth . At 11 months of age , she had severe and global develop-mental delay , recurrent seizures , and poor vision . Physical examination revealed microcephaly , large cutis aplasia of the scalp , optic atrophy , and axial hypotonia with appen-dicular hypertonia . In addition , there was distal reduction of the fingers and toes bilaterally and an absence of distal phalanges and nails Figure 1B . Echocardiography was normal . Brain CT demonstrated hydrocephalus with dila-tation of the lateral ventricles and multiple small periven-tricular and subependymal calcifications Figure 1B . X-rays of the hands and feet revealed absence of the distal phalanges . Individual 2 is a 3.5-year-old girl , the second child to healthy first-cousin Arab parents Figure 1C . She was referred for evaluation of congenital deformity of the hands and feet . Family history is negative . There was history of oli-gohydramnios and decreased fetal movement during preg-nancy . At birth , she was noted to have terminal-reduction defects of her hands and feet and cutis aplasia of the scalp . Her development appeared appropriate except for speech delay . Her physical examination at 3.5 years revealed microcephaly but normal height and weight . There was an area of alopecia with an underlying scar in the scalp . Finger and toe nails were either absent or severely hypo-plastic , as were the distal phalanges , and her hands ap-peared stubby with distorted creases Figure 1D . X-rays of the hands and feet revealed hypoplastic middle phalanges and absent distal phalanges . Echocardiography , EEG , and eye examination were all within normal limits . The two individuals with AOS and their parents were en-rolled in the study with an IRB-approved written informed consent KFSHRC RAC # 2080006 . Blood was collected in EDTA tubes and Na-heparin tubes , and a small-punchskinbiopsywasobtainedwhen-ever possible . Autozygome analysis was performed on individual 1 via the Axiom SNP Platform Affymetrix followed by autoSNPa genomewide determination of runs of homozygos-ity essentially as described before.12 Full-exome capture was performed with the TruSeq Exome Enrichment kit Illumina according to the manu-facturer’s protocol . Samples were pre-pared as an Illumina sequencing library , and in the second step , the sequencing libraries were enriched for the desired target via the Illumina Exome Enrichment protocol . The cap-tured libraries were sequenced with Il-lumina HiSeq 2000 Sequencer . The reads were mapped against UCSC hg19 by BWA . The SNPs and indels were detected by SAMTOOLS . We have previously proposed the effectiveness of combining autozygome data with next-generation se-quencing.13 Indeed , using DNA from individual 1 alone , we were able to apply his autozygome as a filter of the resulting exome data i.e. , we only considered novel coding-sequence variants that were detected within runs of homozygosity ten runs were identified for a total of 1303 genes . By applying this filter , we identified three variants two missense and one indel mutation Table S1 , available online . We prioritized the 4 bp deletion c.1362_1365delAACT , p.Thr455Serfs*24 RefSeq accession number NM_020812.2 in DOCK6 because it was the only truncating mutation identified . Indeed , Sanger sequencing confirmed this homozygous mutation in individual 1 , and her parents were found to be carriers Figure 2 . We then fully sequenced DOCK6 in individual 2 and identified a 1 bp duplication creating a stop codon c.1245dupT , p.Asp416* RefSeq accession number NM_020812.2 , and segregation was confirmed within the family . This second mutation represents an independent confirmation of the involvement of DOCK6 disruption in the pathogenesis of AOS . In order to determine the developmental expression pattern of Dock6 , we performed WISH whole-mount 100 aa Wild type Wild type Individual 1 Individual 2 Parent Parent in situ hybridization on mouse embryos of various stages of development . Expression of Dock6 at E9.5 was observed in the growing edge of the limb buds and in the developing heart Figure 3A . At E10.5 the strongest expression was at the edge of the limb buds , but the heart expression was also maintained Figure 3B . At E11.5 Dock6 mRNA was en-riched in the apical ectodermal ridge of all four limbs Figure 3C . By E12.5 and E13.5 , the expression of Dock6 assumed a more diffused pattern in the four limbs , although the hind-limb , as in previous stages , was always stronger than the fore-limb Figures 3D and 3E , and at E13.5 expression was clearly observed in the developing digits Figures 3F and 3G . Lack of comparable staining with the corresponding sense probes confirmed specificity of the observed signals see Figures 3H and 3I for represen-tative examples . We also carried out q RT-PCR on various mouse adult tissues and found that although Dock6 is ex-pressed in all tissues tested , there was significant Dock6 expression in the heart Figure S1 . Because of the established role of Cdc42 and Rac1 in actin polymerization , 14 we tried to gain insight into the cellular phenotype of DOCK6 mutation by staining patient fibro-blasts homozygous for the p.Thr455Serfs*24 mutation and assessing cytoskeletal organization . A small percentage of cells from individual 1 assumed a rounded phenotype three to four cells per high-power field [ HPF ] , or 16 % with ‘‘blebbing , ’’ which we did not observe in control cells Figures 4A–4C . Compared to control cells , cells from indi-vidual 1 also assumed an unusual elongated morphology and lacked lamellopodia and lateral ruffles Figures 4D and 4E . The characteristics observed in cells from indi-vidual 1 were similar to observations of F-Actin distribution of Rac1-null fibroblast cells , 15 and the rounded phenotype was also similar to that recently observed for HeLa cells after suppression of Cdc42 activity.16 Cdc42 and Rac1 are Rho GTPases , a family of signaling proteins that , through induced polymerization of actin filaments , play key roles in a number of basic cellular processes , such as proliferation , polarization , migra-tion , adhesion , secretion , maintenance of cell morphology , cytokinesis , apoptosis , and phagocytosis.17,18 They function as molecular switches that alternate between an active GTP-bound form and inactive GDP-bound form.19 This cycling in activity level is tightly regulated largely through the opposing action of two classes of proteins GEFs , which stimulate the replacement of GDP with GTP and GAPs , which stimu-late the intrinsic GTPase activity of Rho GTPase and the consequent formation of the inactive GDP-bound form.19 GEFs are classically defined by their possession of Dbl homology DH and pleckstrin homology PH domains , which are required for exchange activity and membranous localization , respectively.20,21 More recently , an atypical family of GEFs , known as DOCKs , was identified in which the protein lacks DH and PH but contains two Dock homology region DHR domains , Dock homology region 1 DHR1 and Dock homology region 2 DHR2 which carry out membranous localization and exchange activity , respectively.22–24 DOCK proteins are further divided into four groups on the basis of substrate specificity and sequence alignment . DOCK6 , along with DOCK7 and DOCK8 , belongs to group C , which increases the avail-ability of the active GTP-bound form of both Cdc42 and Rac1.25 Most available literature on DOCK-C proteins concerns their action on the cytoskeletal reorganization that is required for neurite outgrowth and dendrite forma-tion in tissue culture experiments.26–28 However , available data on germline mutations in DOCK genes suggest a more widespread physiological role . For example , mice with in-activating Dock7 mutations have a generalized pigment deficiency , and humans with inactivating DOCK8 muta-tions have immunodeficiency.29,30 Similarly , DOCK6 was studied in the context of dendrite and axon formation , but data on the phenotypic conse-quences of germline mutation are lacking.25 In this study , we show that recessive germline mutations of this gene do indeed affect the actin cytoskeleton but primarily cause ACC and TTLD rather than the expected neuronal phenotype , although we note here that both individuals displayed microcephaly and that individual 1 had evidence of more severe brain involvement . Therefore , caution is required in extrapolating data on the likely phenotype of germline mutations from tissue culture experiments . The two mutations we report are probably null in nature . Even though NMD is excluded for at least one of the two mutations mutant transcript was readily identifiable on RT-PCR in fibroblasts from individual 1 data not shown , they are both predicted to encode mutant DOCK6 that lacks its two fundamental domains . DHR2 was clearly shown to be both necessary and sufficient for the GDP-to-GTP exchange activity , and DHR1 was shown to be responsible for the interaction with phosphatidylinositol-3 , 4 , 5-triphosphate and hence the membranous localiza-tion of DOCK proteins , but it was also shown to be neces-sary for Rac-dependent cell elongation and cell migration despite adequate Rac GTP loading.24,31 The latter observa-tion suggests a model in which DHR1 is necessary for Rac GTP loading , whereas DHR2 is necessary for the actual Rac signaling.32 Consistent with the proposed null mechanism , our data on the cellular phenotype are virtually identical to those reported in the context of inactivation of Cdc42 and Rac1 as a result of ARHGAP31 mutations specifically , this previous study reported a rounded cell appearance and lack of lamellopodia formation.5 Therefore , a model emerges in which impaired actin-cytoskeleton organiza - tion by inactivation of Cdc42 and Rac1 is a final common pathway in the pathogenesis of AOS , which can be caused by either null mutations of the activating DOCK6 or hy-permorphic mutations of the inactivating ARHGAP31 . Speculation on the link between Cdc42 and Rac1 inacti-vation and the two key features of AOS can be informed by previously published work . For example , Rac1 inactivation in the developing limb buds in mice results in a TTLD remarkably similar to those observed in humans.33,34 This is thought to be a combination of impaired apoptosis of the presumptive interdigital spaces as well as improperly oriented cellular migration . Correctly oriented cellular migration was recently shown to be of critical importance in proper limb bud formation.35 The explanation of the ACC phenotype is less straightforward because it remains unclear why it preferentially affects the vortex area of the scalp . However , evidence shows that targeted inactivation of TGF-b in mouse skin results in an ACC phenotype with a location almost identical to that observed in AOS patients.36 When combined with the recent revelation that Cdc42 activation is necessary for the transduction of TGF-b-induced mobilization of the actin cytoskeleton , 37 a potential mechanistic insight into ACC pathogenesis in AOS can be inferred . In conclusion , our study shows the power of combining exome and autozygome data in unraveling Mendelian genetics by using simplex cases , a clear departure from lators of their signaling might be potential candidate genes 17 , 2377–2390 . 7 , 797–807 . 240 , 1054–1062 .

Effros Keywords RAGE 1 . Introduction The processes of aging have intrigued life scientists for centuries . The mechanisms underlying aging are as yet poorly understood , because they are multifactorial and complex . One widely subscribed theory that encompasses many effects of aging is referred to oxidative stress Harman , 1956 Harper et al. , 2004 Miquel et al. , 1980 . Besides increased oxidative stress , protein glycation with accumulation of advanced glycation endproducts AGE Brownlee , 1994 represents a main mechanism involved in biological aging Bucala and Cerami , 1992 Schmidt et al. , 2007 . During normal aging and in particular in age-related diseases highly modified non-soluble AGE are formed , which are resistant to proteasomal degradation . This leads to an increased accumulation of AGE in various tissues Araki et al. , 1992 Brownlee , 1995 Kume et al. , 1995 . AGE precursor compounds , such as methylglyoxal MG andglyoxal , aredetoxifiedbythecellularglyoxalase system , consisting of glyoxalase-I and -II which convert AGE precursor compounds to lactate and finally pyruvate Kuhla et al. , 2006 Thornalley , 2003 . The capacity of AGE endocytosis is found reduced in aging livers , resulting in spillover into the systemic circulation and extrahepatic deposition of these waste macromolecules Ito et al. , 2007 . The receptor for advanced glycation endproducts RAGE , a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily of cell-surface molecules , interacts with numerous ligands and is involved in distinct developmental and pathological processes Schmidt et al. , 2000 . Binding of AGE to RAGE results in the generation of intracellular oxidative stress and , subse-quently , in the activation of transcription factors such as NF- ? B Bierhaus et al. , 2001 , leading to an enhanced inflammatory response and local tissue injury Stern et al. , 2002 . In contrast , a truncated isoform of RAGE , i.e. soluble RAGE sRAGE and an endogenous secretory RAGE esRAGE , spanning the extracellular ligand-binding domain , have been reported to exert potent anti-inflammatory properties by acting as a decoy for RAGE ligands Park et al. , 1998 . It is widely accepted that mitochondria harbor the biological clock of the cell Harman , 1956 Miquel et al. , 1980 and represent the major sites of cellular reactive oxygen species ROS production . Uncoupling proteins UCPs , present in the inner mitochondrial membrane , take part in regulating the biosynthesis of ATP and the production of ROS . UCP2 activity leads to dissipation of the electrochemical potential difference and results in uncoupling of oxidation and phosphorylation , thus reduction of ATP synthesis . The role of UCP2 as a regulator of ROS production has already been suggested with UCP2 knockout UCP2 ? ? mice showing an increased ROS formation Kuhla et al. , 2010 . Conversely , a mild uncoupling of mitochondrial respiration is considered to prolong the life span of organisms by reducing oxidative stress Andrews and Horvath , 2009 Brand , 2000 Bézaire et al. , 2007 Harper et al. , 2004 . The age-associated increase of oxidative stress stimulates the expression of UCP2 , which may limit the ATP produc-tion in aged livers Barazzoni and Nair , 2001 . Most recently , we could demonstrate that young UCP2 ? ? mice exhibit an oxidative stress-induced rise of hepatic protein glycation Kuhla et al. , 2010 . Based on the fact that mitochondria and mitochondrial respiration-associated oxidative stress play a key role in cellular aging , the present study further focuses on a potential dependency of hepatic RAGE AGE interaction with age . Exposing the mice to galactosamine and lipopolysaccharide G L , we further tested if the age-related oxidative stress and hepatic glycation enhance hepatic vulnerability . We finally studied whether blockade of RAGE AGE interaction by application of rRAGE is capable of dampening the host response to G L . 2 . Materials and methods 2.1 . Animal model UCP2 ? ? mice were kept on the C57BL 6 background and generated as previously published Arsenijevic et al. , 2000 . For the experiments , female littermate controls UCP2+ + or female knockout mice UCP2 ? ? generously provided by Daniel Ricquier and Bruno Miroux , CNRS UPR 9078 , Medical Faculty Necker-Enfants-Malades , Paris , France were used . Due to the fact that UCP2 ? ? mice have a maximum lifespan of 76 wk which is significantly shorter compared to UCP2+ + mice Andrews and Horvath , 2009 we chose the following three time points of age for evaluation , i.e. 8 wk young , 38 wk adult , and 76 wk senescent . Animals were kept on water and standard laboratory chow ad libitum . All animals received humane care according to the German legislation on protection of animals and the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals NIH publication 86-23 revised 1985 . 2.2 . Sampling and assays All animals were exsanguinated by puncture of the vena cava inferior for immediate separation of plasma , followed by harvest of liver tissue . Measurement of plasma malondialdehyde MDA , serving as an indicator of lipid peroxidation and oxidative stress , was performed using the MDA-586 method according to the manufacturer s instruc-tions OxisResearchTM , Portland , OR , USA . Cellular redox status in plasma of UCP2 ? ? and UCP2+ + animals wasassessedbymeasuring theratio ofglutathione GSH toglutathione disulfide GSSG using the GSH GSSG-412 assay according to the manu-facturer s instructions OxisResearchTM . Harvested liver tissue was processed for isolation of proteins and DNA . For this purpose , liver tissue was homogenized in lysis buffer 10 mM Tris pH 7.5 , 10 mM NaCl , 0.1 mM EDTA , 0.5 % Triton-X 100 , 0.02 % NaN3 and 0.2 mM PMSF , protease inhibitor cocktail , incubated for 30 min on ice and centrifuged for 15 min at 10,000 ? g . Protein contents were assayed by bicinchoninic acid method Pierce , Biotechnology with BSA Pierce , Biotechnology as standard . For verification of UCP2 deficiency DNA was isolated from liver tissue . 25 mg of tissue was incubated for 1 h at 97 °C with 50 mM NaOH . After adding 1 M Tris HCl pH 8.0 the probe was centri-fuge 5 min at 14,000 ? g . Free 8-hydroxy-2-deoxy guanosine 8-OH-dG served as an indicator for oxidative damage of DNA and was measured using an enzyme immune assay kit according to the manufacturer s instruc-tions Cayman Chemical Company , MI , USA . The 8-OH-dG content was calculated by dividing the DNA content of each individual sample and is given as pg ? g DNA . 2.3 . Assessment of hepatic glyoxalase-I activity The activity of glyoxalase-I in hepatic protein extracts was measured using the hemithioacetal of MG as substrate according to the method of Allen and Thornalley Allen et al. , 1993 . Briefly , 2 ? mol MG and 2 ? mol glutathione each in sodium phosphate buffer 50 mM , pH 6.6 , 995 ? L were preincubated at 37 °C for 10 min to form the hemithioacetal . Five micro liters of the protein extract was added and the increase in absorbance measured at 240 nm using a spectrophotometer Utrospec 3000 , Pharmacia Biotech , Cambridge , UK . Glyoxalase-I activity was calculated by means of the Beer–Lambert law with ? ? 240 2.86 mM ? 1 cm ? 1 and considering dilution factor and rate of reaction per minute Allen et al. , 1993 The specific activity of glyoxalase-I was calculated by dividing the total glyoxalase-Iactivity bythe amount of total protein per mL in the preparation . 2.4 . Analysis of UCP2 deficiency by semiquantitative PCR in liver tissue PCR for murine UCP2 and GAPDH was performed in a 20 ? L reaction volume containing 3 ? L DNA , 1 ? reaction puffer , 1.5 mM MgCl2 , 200 ? M dNTPs , and 5000 U mL Taq polymerase . Samples were incubated with the following primers for GAPDH , forward 5 -CGT CCC GTA GAC AAA ATG GT-3 and reverse 5 -GAA TTT GCC GTG AGT GGA GT-3 and for verification of the UCP2 mutation forwild-type locus and mutant locus forward5 -CGTTCT GGG TACCAT CCT AAC C-3 annealsto UCP2 exon 4 region deleted in target construct and reverse 5 -CAA GCC TCC ATC CAA GTG TCA C-3 anneals to intron 4 in the homologous region and run for 30 GAPDH and 35 UCP2 cycles denaturation for 30 s at 94 °C annealing for 30 s at 65 °C and elongation for 30 s at 72 °C using a thermocycler . All PCR products were analyzed on a 1 % agarose gel peqGOLD Universal Agarose peQLab Biotechnologie , Erlangen , Germany containingGelStar®NucleicAcid Gel Stain Lonza , Rockland , ME , USA .

Western blot analysis of hepatic highly modified AGE , MG-AGE and RAGE On 12 % SDS gels 40 ? g protein per lane was separated and transferred to a polyvinyldifluoride membrane Immobilon-P Milli-pore , Eschborn , Germany . After blocking with 2 % BSA Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Santa Cruz , CA , USA , membranes were incubated for 2 h at room temperature with a peroxidase-linked polyclonal anti-AGE 1 2000 AGE612HRP Biologo , Kronshagen , Germany , which detects predominantly highly modified AGE and with a mouse monoclonal anti-MG-AGE 1 500 AGE06B Biologo , which detects methylglyoxal modifications of AGE MG-AGE , followed by a secondary peroxidase-linked rabbit anti-mouse antibody 1 10,000 Sigma . In addition , membranes were exposed with a goat polyclonal anti-RAGE antibody 1 500 R D Systems , Wiesbaden-Nordenstadt , Germany overnight , followed by peroxidase-linked donkey anti-goat antibody 1 5000 Santa Cruz Biotechnology . Protein expression was visualized by means of luminol-enhanced chemiluminescence ECL plus Amersham Pharmacia Biotech , Freiburg , Germany and digita-lized with ChemiDoc™ XRS System Bio-Rad Laboratories , Munich , Germany . Signals were densitometrically assessed Quantity One Bio-Rad Laboratories and normalized to the ? -actin signals mouse monoclonal anti- ? -actin antibody 1 20,000 Sigma . 2.6 . Histology and immunohistochemistry of liver tissue For hematoxylin and eosin H E staining and immunohistochem-ical analysis of UCP2 as well as sRAGE positive liver cells tissue was fixed in 4 % phosphate-buffered formalin for 2–3 days and subsequently embedded in paraffin . From the paraffin-embedded tissue blocks , 4 ? m thin sections were put on poly-L-lysine covered glass slides and exposed to a goat polyclonal anti-RAGE antibody R D Systems . For the development of sRAGE with DAB chromogen Universal LSAB® kits System-HRP DakoCytomation , Dako , Hamburg , Germany were used according to the manufacturer s instructions . For the development of UCP2 with Liquid Permanent Red Chromogen Dako the sections were incubated with a secondary alkaline phosphatase-linked donkey anti-goat antibody 1 200 , Santa Cruz Biotechnology . The sections were counterstained with hemalaun and analyzed with a light microscope Olympus BX51 , Hamburg , Germany . Positive cells were counted within 50 consecutive fields ? 40 objective and given as cells per mm2 . 2.7 .

Verification of UCP2 deficiency In accordance to the report of Arsenijevic et al . Arsenijevic et al. , 2000 , we could confirm the genetic phenotype of the UCP2 ? ? mice by PCR Fig. 1A and by immunohistochemistry Fig. 1B . Verification of UCP2 deficiency was performed for all animals used . and 76 wk old UCP2+ + and UCP2 ? ? mice A . Representative immunohistochemistry B lower panel . Original magnification ? 400 . 3.2 . Age-dependent increase of UCP2 expression In UCP2+ + mice , livers revealed the restriction of UCP2 expression to non-parenchymal cells . While very few UCP2 positive non-parenchymal cells were found in 8 wk old mice , there was an increase in UCP2 expressing non-parenchymal cells in 38 wk and , particularly , in 76 wk old animals Fig. 1B . 3.3 . Increase of hepatic oxidative stress during aging Due to fact that we observed an increase of UCP2 protein expression with aging , we were interested in the consequence of this observation with respect to oxidative stress and hepatic glycation . For this purpose , we determined the plasma MDA concentrations , the systemic GSH to GSSG ratio and the hepatic 8-OH-dG content in 8 , 38 and 76 wk old UCP2+ + and UCP2 ? ? mice . UCP2+ + mice demonstrated an increase of oxidative stress markers in age dependency Fig. 2A and B , black bars , as given by a stepwise increase of MDA Fig. 2A , black bars and a stepwise decrease of the GSH GSSG ratio from young to adult and senescent animals Fig. 2B , black bars . The 8-OH-dG content in hepatic tissue of UCP2+ + mice serving as a marker of oxidative stress-associated DNA damage was found unchanged with age Fig. 2C , black bars . UCP2 ? ? mice showed significantly higher levels of lipid peroxidation compared to UCP2+ + mice which already reached a maximum of MDA concentrations in 38 wk old mice Fig. 2A , grey bars . In addition , UCP2 ? ? mice of all age groups showed very low values of the GSH GSSG ratio , and 2-fold higher values of 8-OH-dG content in hepatic tissue , indicating high oxidative stress throughout life Fig . 2B and C , grey bars . 3.4 . RAGE and sRAGE expression The hepatic expression of RAGE showed also a dependency to age with 10–15-fold higher values in 38 and 76 wk old UCP2+ + mice in comparison to 8 wk old UCP2+ + animals Fig. 3 , black bars . The 8 wk old UCP2 ? ? mice exhibited 6-times higher RAGE expression compared to age-matched UCP2+ + mice , while with advanced age hepatic RAGE expression did not markedly differ between UCP2 ? ? and UCP2+ + mice Fig. 3 , grey bars . Immunohistochemical analysisof sRAGErevealedanage-dependent decrease of sRAGE positive cells in both UCP2+ + and UCP2 ? ? mice Fig. 4A and B . Of note , however , is the fact that the number of sRAGE positive cells in UCP2 ? ? mice was approximately 50 % to 70 % lower compared to that in UCP2+ + mice Fig. 4B . 3.5 . Glyoxalase-I activity and formation of highly modified AGE and MG - AGE In 38 and 76 wk old UCP2+ + livers , activity of glyoxalase-I was found significantly decreased when compared to 8 wk old UCP2+ + livers . Glyoxalase-I activity in livers of 8 wk old UCP2 ? ? mice was already significantly lower in comparison to UCP2+ + mice and did not further decline with age Fig. 5 . Western blot analysis of highly modified AGE showed multiple bands ranging from 12 to N60 kDa Fig. 6A , right panel . For analysis we chose the 60 kDa band and could demonstrate that aging in UCP2+ + mice is associated with a 1.6-fold increase of AGE formation Fig. 6A , black bars . Notably , the 8 wk old UCP2 ? ? mice presented with significantly higher AGE values than age-matched UCP2+ + mice . With increasing age of UCP2 ? ? mice , there was a further though very moderate increase of AGE Fig. 6A , grey bars with values , constantly exceeding those of the UCP2+ + mice . In order to substantiate that the decrease of glyoxalase-I activity in UCP2 ? ? mice at 8 wk is responsible for the increased AGE levels at the same age , we further assessed MG-AGE using an antibody specific for MG modifications . In line with the reduced glyoxalase-I activity livers of young UCP2 ? ? mice revealed a ~3-fold higher MG-AGE modification when compared to age-matched livers of UCP2+ + mice Fig. 6B , left panel . 3.6 . Survival rate after G L exposure and pretreatment with rRAGE All animals studied started to die at 4 h after application of G L Fig. 7 . At 24 h the survival rate of 8 and 38 wk old UCP2+ + mice was 30–40 % , whereas only 1 out of 10 10 % of the oldest UCP2+ + mice survived Fig. 7A . G L-exposed UCP2 ? ? mice showed almost comparable survival rates of 20–33 % Fig. 7B . After the additional pretreatment with rRAGE , 2 out of 10 young UCP2+ + mice Fig. 7C 20 % and 5 out of 10 age-matched UCP2 ? ? mice survived Fig. 7D 50 % . Though not statistically significant p 0.06 this reveals a slight survival advantage by the RAGE blockade . In addition G L-challenged 8 wk old UCP2 ? ? mice with rRAGE treatment revealed lower hepatic tissue damage Fig. 8D , while all other animals exhibited marked liver tissue disintegration Fig. 8 . 4 . Discussion The present study confirms previous results of our group demonstrating that UCP2 deficiency enhances the AGE RAGE inter-action Kuhla et al. , 2010 . We further extend this observation by providing the following findings i Aging goes along with an increase of oxidative stress and in consequence with an ii increase of UCP2 expression . In addition oxidative stress leads to iii a rise of MG-AGE and an accumulation of highly modified AGE , iv being accompanied by an upregulation of RAGE expression . v UCP2 deficiency is associated with significantly higher levels of oxidative stress in all age groups . vi This , however , enhances RAGE AGE interaction only in livers of 8 , but not of 38 and 76 wk old mice . As a consequence , vii only young UCP2 ? ? mice benefit from rRAGE therapy in acute liver injury , as indicated by a slightly better survival rate and less liver injury compared to age-matched UCP2+ + mice . Aging is characterized by a decline of anatomical integrity and function across multiple organ systems Semba et al. , 2010 , most supposedly due to an age-related increase of oxidative stress , as shown by the current study . A major consequence of increased oxidative stress is the accumulation of AGE Kuhla et al. , 2005 Schleicher and Friess , 2007 . It is well known that AGE are not only generated during pathological conditions , such as hyperglycemia and diabetes Brownlee , 1995 Rolo and Palmeira , 2006 , but also during aging , as various forms of AGE have been detected in aged tissues Ahmed et al. , 2005 Glenn et al. , 2007 . In line with this , the present study could demonstrate that aged animals which show an increased oxidative stress also exhibit an increase of highly modified AGE . Moreover , activity of the glyoxalase system which detoxifies AGE precursor compounds , is age-dependent , as given by the decrease of hepatic tissue glyoxalase-I activity . In consequence , there is an age - Fig. 5 . Analysis of glyoxalase-I activity in livers of 8 , 38 and 76 wk old UCP2+ + n 21 and UCP2 ? ? mice n 21 .

These highly modified AGE are resistant to proteasomal degradation and are eliminated by liver sinusoidal endothelial cells and Kupffer cells via scavenger receptor-mediated endocytosis Smedsrød et al. , 1997 . The capacity of AGE endocytosis is found reduced in the aging liver , which results in spillover into the systemic circulation and extrahepatic deposition of these waste macromolecules Ito et al. , 2007 . Besides binding to scavenger receptors , AGE also interact with RAGE . This AGE RAGE interaction results in the generation of intracellular oxidative stress and , subsequently , in the activation of transcription factors , such as NF- ? B , leading to an enhanced inflam-matory response and local tissue injury Fehrenbach et al. , 2001 Guimarães et al. , 2010 Iwamoto et al. , 2008 Yoshida et al. , 2006 . In turn , oxidative stress also stimulates the RAGE–ligand interaction Yao and Brownlee , 2010 , thereby causing an age-dependent upregulation of RAGE , as shown by the present study . Thus , a vicious circle of AGE RAGE and oxidative stress may be initiated and accelerated Schleicher and Friess , 2007 . In contrast to RAGE , the truncated isoform of RAGE , i.e. soluble RAGE sRAGE , has been reported to exert potent anti-inflammatory properties by acting as a decoy forRAGEligands Parket al. , 1998 . Thus , diminishedexpression of sRAGEin liversof 38 and 76 wk old animalsmightfurther contribute to the harmful effects of AGE RAGE interaction at higher age . It has been proposed that mitochondria are the biological clock , because mitochondrial dysfunction leads to an overproduction of ROS Harman , 1956 Miquel et al. , 1980 and may cause the described age-related “chronic” oxidative stress . Mitochondrial UCP2 limits the production of ROS by decreasing the mitochondrial membrane potential Harper et al. , 2004 . Therefore a mild uncoupling is considered to prolong the lifespan Andrews and Horvath , 2009 Brand , 2000 Bézaire et al. , 2007 . Notably , the present in vivo study shows that aging goes along with an increase of hepatic UCP2 expression . It is reasonable to interpret this finding in that the aging organism compensates for enhanced oxidative stress with an increase of UCP2 expression . At the same time , increased UCP2 expression represents a potential molecular mediator of impaired energy production in the aging process Barazzoni and Nair , 2001 Mizuno et al. , 2000 . Thus , age-associated increase of UCP2 expression may attenuate oxidative stress burden at the expenses of reduced ATP availability . Vice versa , a defect in UCP2 expression or an inhibition of UCP2 function results in increased ROS formation , as illustrated by various in vitro and in vivo experiments Duval et al. , 2002 Nègre-Salvayre et al. , 1997 . We could confirm this finding and additionally show that UCP2 deficiency is associated with an increase of AGE RAGE interaction . We further extend our previous report that hepatic and systemically circulating sRAGE is significantly lower in UCP2 ? ? than in UCP2+ + mice Kuhla et al. , 2010 with the observation that the numbers of hepatic cells expressing sRAGE are markedly lower in the UCP2 ? ? than in the UCP2+ + mice . Summing up , these alterations let the UCP2 ? ? mice expect to be more susceptible towards G L-induced acute liver failure than UCP2+ + mice . Moreover , they are supposed to benefit from rRAGE treatment , as blockade of RAGE has been shown to attenuate hepatic ischemia and reperfusion injury in mice Zeng et al. , 2004 . However , we could not prove these assumptions as UCP2 ? ? mice neither exhibit markedly higher mortality rates nor benefit from rRAGE treatment , except of the young animals . One can only speculate on these findings There are studies of other groups , demonstrating that UCP2 deficiency results in limited loss of hepatic ATP content in FAS-mediated liver injury Fülöp et al. , 2006 and in liver tissue upon ischemia and reperfusion Evans et al. , 2008 . In accordance , we could previously show that UCP2 ? ? mice reveal higher hepatic ATP levels Le Minh et al. , 2009 . This might allowthem to bettercompensate for theage-relatedincreasedoxidative stress and protein glycation , finally exhibiting almost comparable survival rates when compared with age-matched UCP2+ + mice . The additional observation that rRAGE treatment increased only the survival rate of young UCP2 ? ? mice , while neither UCP2+ + mice regardless of age nor the older UCP2 ? ? profited by the treatment and even showed slightly higher mortality rates might partly be explained by the function of rRAGE . If rRAGE serves as substitution of sRAGE , it seems plausible that survival advantage becomes obvious in the 8 wk old UCP2+ + and UCP2 ? ? mice , as they mostly differ with respect to the number of sRAGE positive cells . The failure to observe a protection by rRAGE might additionally be due to the fact that either the G L stimulus is far too strong and may partly overwhelm the benefit of RAGE blockade or other factors than hepatic glycation predominantly determine liver injury in the older animals .

21831968	CONCLUSIONS—ADO A1AR signaling contributes importantly to insulin-controlled glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity in C57BL 6 mice and is involved in the metabolic regulation of adipose tissue . Diabetes 60 2578–2587 , 2011 A denosine ADO , a purine nucleoside , is a ubiq-uitous product of ATP breakdown , with a large variety of regulatory functions . ADO effects are mediated by four receptors AR A1 , A2a , A2b , and A3 , each showing an organ-specific expression pattern and different half-maximal effective concentration EC50 , thus facilitating differential effects 1 . ARs mediate downstream effects mostly via G-protein–coupled recep-tors that are either stimulatory A2a and A2b or inhibitory A1 and A3 to adenylate cyclase . The resulting increase or decrease of cAMP induces downstream signaling by trig-gering phosphorylation activation of key enzymes 2 . A role of the metabolic byproduct of ATP utilization , adenosine , in the regulation of glucose uptake and utili-zation makes physiological sense . Nevertheless , previous studies of the effect of ADO on glucose transport have yielded conflicting results in that insulin sensitivity and or glucose uptake were reported as either decreased 3–6 or increased 7–9 . The availability of mice with adenosine receptor deletions offers a new way to assess the role of a chronic reduction in ADO signaling on glucose tolerance . Recently , we discovered a nephropathic phenotype in an A1AR-deficient Akita hybrid mouse model of type 1 di-abetes , suggesting a relevant role for A1AR signaling in maintaining glucose homeostasis 10 . Another recent study showed that mice with A1AR deletion have a higher fat content with aging 11 . Because of the well-established relationship between excess body weight and insulin re-sistance , we considered it possible that the phenotype of A1AR-deficient mice may include the development of glu-cose intolerance and insulin resistance . In the current study , we have therefore used A1AR-deficient mice to examine the hypothesis that ADO signaling via A1AR contributes to glucose homeostasis . Our main findings support this notion in that A1AR-deficient mice show a defect in glucose tol-erance that seems to be a result of insulin resistance . RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Blood sampling and determination of blood parameters . In the plasma of blood samples collected in conscious mice by tail-vein puncture using 30-g needles , glucose concentrations were measured using the Glucostix AccuCheck Intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test . Intraperitoneal glucose tolerance Hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp study . Hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic and corresponding insulin values respectively . tAUC results were compared like univariable data . P values , 0.05 were considered significant . RESULTS Food consumption and locomotor activity . Food intake measured over 10 consecutive days in 12-to 14-week-old C57BL 6 mice averaged 3.85 6 0.1 g day in wild-type n 10 , 4 male and 6 female and 4.12 6 0.06 g day in A1AR2 2 n 12 , 6 male and 6 female P 0.024 mice . Thus , caloric intake was significantly greater in A1AR2 2 than wild-type mice . Likewise , water intake was significantly higher in A1AR2 2 than wild-type mice 7.75 6 0.01 mL day vs. 6.9 6 0.17 mL day P , 0.01 . Twenty-four–hour mean spontaneous locomotor activity measured by radioteleme-try and expressed as movement counts per minute averaged 6.5 6 3.3 in wild-type n 5 and 6.3 6 0.8 in A1AR2 2 n 5 mice . Mean arterial blood pressure was not different between wild-type and A1AR2 2 mice 108 6 2.8 mmHg vs. 107 6 1.25 mmHg n 5 Body weight , body composition , and fat fraction . Body weights in male mice were compared at baseline at 8–9 weeks and repeatedly between 20 and 29 weeks on either the standard diet or HFD . The latter data were pooled for analysis . A1AR2 2 mice on the standard diet were signifi-cantly heavier than wild-type mice already at baseline . The difference under the standard diet was even more pro-nounced in the 20-to 29-week age-group , and feeding the HFD further increased body weight . The extra weight gain in A1AR2 2 mice was caused by a significantly higher proportion of body fat , whereas no difference in lean mass was obvious . Fittingly , the epididymal fat mass was sig-nificantly greater in male A1AR2 2 compared with wild-type mice Fig. 1 . Serum concentration of adipokines and lipids . The serum leptin concentration of mice in the 25-to 30-week age range averaged 1.0 6 0.22 ng mL in wild-type mice , which was significantly lower than the value of 3.19 6 0.81 ng mL found in A1AR2 2 mice P 0.15 Fig. 2A . Body weights of these groups of mice were 25.4 6 1.4 g and 29 6 1.1 g in wild-type and A1AR2 2 mice , respectively . Serum concentrations of adiponectin were not different between genotypes , averaging 5.8 6 0.6 mg mL and 6.2 6 0.45 mg mL in wild-type and A1AR2 2 mice , respectively Fig. 2B . In mice on standard diets , FFA serum concentrations tended to be higher in A1AR2 2 than wild-type mice 352 6 34 mmol L vs. 273 6 29 mmol L P 0.091 Fig. 2C . A similar nonsignificant tendency was observed in serum triglyceride concentrations between the A1AR2 2 and wild-type mice 55.8 6 33.8 mg dL vs. 65.7 6 5.9 mg dL P 0.16 Fig. 2D . There were no sex differences in either FFA or triglyceride serum concentrations . FFA serum concentrations in A1AR2 2 mice on the HFD tended to be higher than in wild-type mice without quite reaching sig-nificance 359 6 61 mmol L vs. 217 6 30 mmol L n 10 vs. n 9 P 0.06 . Triglyceride serum concentrations in mice fed the HFD were not different between A1AR2 2 and wild-type genotypes 110.8 6 7.2 mg dL vs. 111.4 6 14 mg dL , but they were significantly higher than in mice on standard diets . Fasting plasma glucose and insulin . Plasma glucose concentration after a 10-to 12-h fasting period was sig-nificantly higher in A1AR2 2 than in wild-type mice at 8 weeks and at 20–28 weeks on both the standard diet and the HFD . Intragroup comparison showed no significance in wild-type mice on the standard diet comparing 8–9 with 20–28 weeks , but wild-type mice at 20–28 weeks on the standard diet had significantly lower plasma glucose than age-matched mice on the HFD P , 0.0001 . In contrast , the plasma glucose of A1AR2 2 mice increased significantly with age on both the standard diet and HFD Fig. 3A . Fasting plasma insulin was higher in A1AR2 2 than in wild-type mice . The difference was significant at 8 weeks on the standard diet and at 20–28 weeks on the HFD . Looking at age-related effects , the intragroup comparison showed that the fasting plasma insulin of wild-type mice differed significantly between 8–9 and 20–28 weeks on the standard diet P 0.0257 and highly significantly at 20–28 weeks on the HFD P , 0.0001 . A1AR2 2 mice , in contrast , did not increase fasting plasma insulin significantly between 8–9 and 20–28 weeks on the standard diet but had significantly higher values on the HFD compared with the standard diet at 20–28 weeks P , 0.0001 Fig. 3B . ipGTTs . Plasma glucose clearance after an intraperitoneal glucose challenge was significantly delayed in A1AR2 2 mice compared with wild-type controls on a C57BL 6 background , as indicated by a significant reduction of the tAUC min mg dL Fig. 4A–C . To test whether impaired glucose tolerance was caused by defects in insulin secre-tion or insulin action , we measured plasma insulin levels during an ipGTT . At 8 weeks of age , insulin levels were FIG. 5 . Modified Belfiore ISI calculated from ipGTTs of plasma glucose and insulin concentrations Belfiore ISI .

No difference in mice on the HFD Wt n 7 A1AR2 2 n 5 . Intragroup comparison increasing age on the SD led to significantly lower index values in Wt and A1AR2 2 mice . No difference was seen between A1AR2 2 mice on the HFD at 20–22 weeks vs. the SD at 20 weeks . In contrast , in Wt mice HFD lowered ISI significantly . NS , nonsignificant . significantly higher in the mutant mice compared with the controls , suggesting that glucose intolerance was a result of insulin resistance rather than insulin deficiency Fig. 4A . After 20 weeks of age , glucose-stimulated insulin se-cretion was comparable in mutant and wild-type mice , suggesting that insufficient insulin secretion may have contributed to impaired glucose tolerance in adult A1AR2 2 mice . However , a trend toward an increased insulin re-sponse in the knockout compared with the wild-type mice still was recognizable at 20–22 weeks P 0.09 . The insulin curve showed a biphasic pattern , with a delayed second-phase response capability in the knockout mice , suggest-ing a defective secretion mechanism Fig. 4B . This finding was enhanced in mice on the HFD . The mutant mice on the HFD showed a significantly and paradoxically reduced insulin secretion at the age of ~20 weeks , suggesting that an HFD further worsened islet function . These mice lost the physiological response to the glucose stimulus Fig. 4C . In general , this documentation of an insufficient insulin re-sponse in adult A1AR2 2 mice compares well with the age-dependent differences of insulin secretion pattern that were noticed in the fasting-mice baseline values Fig. 3B . To determine the potential impact of the genetic back-ground , we performed the ipGTT test in A1AR2 2 mice on a congenic Swiss background . Again , after an intraperitoneal glucose challenge , tAUCs min mg dL under the glucose curve were significantly increased in A1AR2 2 compared with wild-type mice Fig. 4D . in the congenic Swiss background .

A1AR2 2 on a standard diet at 8 and 20 weeks had significantly decreased index compared with wild-type mice , suggesting reduced insulin sensitivity . In contrast , the indices in mice fed the HFD were equal . When comparing intragroup differences , it is obvious that increasing age on the standard diet led to significantly lower index values in wild-type and A1AR2 2 mice , re-spectively 8 vs. 20 weeks wild type , P 0.015 A1AR2 2 , P , 0.001 . No difference was seen between A1AR2 2 mice on the HFD at 20–22 weeks compared with the standard diet at 20 weeks P 0.25 , whereas in wild-type mice , the HFD led to a markedly significant lower ISI compared with the standard diet P , 0.0001 , a lower index representing decreased insulin sensitivity Fig. 5 . Hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp . To determine the mechanism of insulin resistance in the A1AR-deficient mice , we performed hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp studies in 18-week-old female mice fasted for 5 h Fig. 6 . Basal glucose turnover was comparable in wild-type and A1AR2 2 mice , although plasma insulin levels were sig-nificantly higher in the mutant mice Fig. 6E and D . During the clamp , insulin was infused at the rate of 4 mU kg min to achieve physiological hyperinsulinemia ~2 ng mL Fig. 6D , and glucose was infused at a variable rate to maintain blood glucose at ~150 mg dL Fig. 6A and C . The glucose infusion rate was significantly lower in the A1AR2 2 mice , consistent with insulin resistance Fig. 6B . Under the clamp conditions used , endogenous glucose production was equally suppressed in both strains the reduced glu-cose infusion rate in the A1AR2 2 mice was mainly at-tributed to lower glucose disposal rates Fig. 6E . To test which tissues contributed to this difference between the strains , we used a nonmetabolized glucose tracer , 2-deoxy-glucose 2-DG . As shown in Fig. 6F , the A1AR2 2 mice showed significantly reduced 2-DG uptake into white adi-pose tissue WAT and a trend toward lower 2-DG uptake into skeletal muscle P 0.12 , whereas the uptake into brown adipose tissue was comparable between the strains . Clamp studies performed in male mice showed similar trends not shown . Taken together , these data demon-strate that the insulin resistance in the A1AR2 2 mice was associated with a reduced glucose uptake into WAT and , possibly , skeletal muscle . Insulin signaling . To test if insulin resistance in A1AR2 2 mice is associated with impaired downstream signaling , we determined insulin-dependent phosphorylation of pro-tein kinase B Akt in skeletal muscle . As shown in Fig. 7 , insulin-induced phosphorylation of Akt was markedly reduced in A1AR2 2 compared with wild-type mice . Of note , total Akt protein seemed to be higher in the mutant mice for reasons currently unknown . The abundance of phospho-extracellular signal–related kinase 1 2 following insulin was not different between wild-type and A1AR2 2 mice data not shown . DISCUSSION The main finding of the current study is the demonstration that mice with a null mutation of the A1AR display reduced glucose tolerance , had decreased insulin sensitivity , and had a significantly lower net glucose uptake under clamp conditions . The phenotype is strain independent because it weight Wt n 3 female and 1 male , mean age 21 weeks A1AR2 2 n 2 min mg dL of glucose clearance were significantly increased in A1AR2 2 0.01 ***P 0.001 . NS , not significant . 0.05 **P 0.01 . was observed in two different mouse strains with deletion of the A1AR locus C57BL 6 and Swiss . Furthermore , our data show a worsening of the phenotype with age or body weight , as can be typically seen in type 2 diabetes . Our findings demonstrate that A1AR signaling contributes im-portantly to maintaining glucose homeostasis and physiolog-ical insulin action . Aside from affecting glucose metabolism , A1ARs also modify fat metabolism , as evidenced by an increase in adipose tissue mass . Facilitation of glucose uptake by ADO previously has been reported in isolated hindquarter preparation and , conversely , inhibition of ADO actions by methylxanthine-inhibited insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in isolated rat muscle strips 7,17 . There is some evidence that this ADO action is mediated by A1ARs because A1AR activation directly stimulates insulin-mediated glucose transport in oxidative muscle during contractions and indirectly con-tributes to enhanced insulin and glucose delivery to muscle fibers during contractions by increasing the blood flow by vasodilatation 18 . Maeda and Koos 19 observed a depressing effect of endogenous ADO on insulin and glu-cose concentrations in fetal sheep via A1ARs . More re-cently , it has been reported that adenosine A1 selective activation elicits 50 % of insulin-stimulated glucose trans-port in isolated skeletal muscle without influencing either basal or maximal insulin-stimulated glucose uptake 20 . Moreover , the partial A1AR agonist , CVT-3619 , improved insulin resistance during hyperinsulinemic clamp studies in C57BL J6 mice fed an HFD 21 . Genetically engineered mice overexpressing A1ARs were protected against insulin resistance during HFD-induced obesity 22 . Prolonged A1AR stimulation led to downregulation of A1AR recep-tors in neurons , whereas streptozotocin-induced diabetes led to an increase of A1AR gene expression 23,24 . These reports suggest the existence of a feedback cycle of plasma glucose levels and A1AR signaling to maintain glucose ho-meostasis . In contrast , using a genetic model of A1AR de-ficiency , Johansson et al. 25,26 reported the absence of an effect on glucose tolerance but an increase of pancreatic insulin secretion after glucose stimuli . The cellular mechanisms by which ADO may enhance glucose uptake are not clear . Our data show a signifi-cantly reduced phosphorylation of Akt kinase in skeletal muscle following stimulation by insulin . In view of the well-established role of Akt as a downstream constituent of the insulin-signaling pathway , reduced insulin-dependent activation could lead to a reduction in the membrane traf-ficking of Glut4 and hence reduced glucose uptake 27 . Activation of A1AR regulates several membrane and in-tracellular proteins , such as adenylate cyclase , phospho-lipase C , Ca2+ channels , and K+ channels 28 . In rat hepatoma cells , A1AR stimulation of the Na+-dependent ADO transporter , CNT2 , is dependent on ATP-sensitive K+ channel activity . This mechanism is more effective under high extracellular glucose concentrations , suggesting that A1AR-dependent cellular uptake of ADO may participate in adapting the intracellular purine content to excess extra-cellular glucose usable to be metabolized 28 . Selective A1AR inhibition in these cells attenuated glucose pro-duction and glycogenolysis 29 . Therefore , ADO seems to mediate the increase of intracellular glucose that can be used as substrate for oxidative glycolysis to produce ATP , and the A1AR pathway seems to participate in this process by promoting uptake of extracellular glucose . Other than demonstrating a significant impairment in whole-body glucose uptake , our studies show that the body weights of A1AR-deficient mice are significantly greater than that of normal control mice and that this is associated with a higher proportion of fat tissue Fig. 1A–D . An effect of A1AR deficiency on body weight also has been reported by Johansson et al. 11 , who observed signifi-cantly higher body weights in A1AR2 2 mice at $ 5 months of age . Although locomotor activity was similar between genotypes , the weight gain of A1AR-deficient mice was associated with a significantly higher food and water in-take , suggesting an impairment of regulation of energy balance . Although wild-type mice fed an HFD gained weight compared with standard diet–fed mice of both groups Fig. 1 , the HFD further enhanced the difference of glucose intolerance between A1AR2 2 and wild-type mice . These effects were a result of an increasing failure of com-pensatory insulin secretion in A1AR2 2 Figs . 4C and 5 . Although a significant impairment in glucose tolerance was noted in the A1AR2 2 mice already shortly after weaning Fig. 4A , the difference in body weight only be-came significant when the mice reached adulthood . The age dependence of growth rate may result from differen-tially regulated humoral factors affecting fat metabolism , such as growth hormone , or adipokines , such as adipo-nectin and leptin 30–36 . In isolated white adipocytes and epididymal fat pads , ADO mediates and positively regu-lates the effect of insulin on leptin release , probably via the phosphokinase C phospholipase C activation caused by A1AR stimulation 34,35 . Leptin then negatively controls caloric intake and increases energy expenditure . However , our data indicate that the insulin resistance in A1AR-deficient mice is not caused by a reduced leptin expression Fig. 2A . ADO A1AR signaling maintains a tonic inhibition of lipolysis in WAT in vitro . Specific blockade of the A1AR receptor or ADO deprivation by supraphysiological doses of adenosine deaminase leads to maximal lipolysis 36 . Therefore , in isolated white adipocytes , a functional A1AR-signaling system seems to counterbalance a leptin-induced lipolysis by means of a negative-feedback loop . However , leptin effects , as concluded from in vitro findings , would be suspected to lead to lipolysis in A1AR-deficient mice , an expectation not supported by our measurements of FFAs Fig. 2C . The significant elevation of leptin in A1AR2 2 parallels the increased body fat mass but does not play a causal role for the insulin-resistant phenotype of the A1AR2 2 mice . Adiponectin remained unchanged in A1AR2 2 Fig. 2B . Hence , the increased body fat mass of the A1AR2 2 mice reflects a complexity of fat metabolism in vivo that is not mimicked sufficiently by in vitro studies . For example , the direct inhibitory effect of ADO A1AR signaling on key enzymes of lipid regulation , such as the hormone-sensitive lipase and the adipose triglycerate li-pase , has been deduced from experimental evidence but has not yet been demonstrated in vivo 37 . The fat , glucose-intolerant A1AR2 2 phenotype might hint toward the existence of functionally different effects of ADO sig-naling in lean compared with obese animals 38,39 . Another possible mechanism for the different body composition and faster weight gain of A1AR2 2 mice could be a dis-turbance of the hypothalamic regulation of food con-sumption and energy expenditure , which can result in a progressive and significant weight gain 30,31 . The hypothalamic-derived orexins hypocretins control arousal during the sleep wake cycle , stimulate food intake after awakening , and promote pro-obese metabolic effects . Thus , these molecules are regarded as sensors for metabolism and arousal in the central nervous system and thereby participate in the hormonal cyclic regulation of metabolic homeostasis . In mammals , the disruption of circadian rhythms is involved in the development of metabolic syndrome and obesity . This has been shown in narcoleptic humans , who , being deficient in orexin hypocretin sig-naling , have a tendency toward obesity 40–42 . Of in-terest , the expression of orexin hypocretin is negatively controlled by ADO A1AR signaling 43,44 . ADO A1AR effects include sleep-promoting via control of orexinergic tone in rats , thereby exerting an influence on hypotha-lamic circadian rhythm 45,46 . Moreover , specific ADO A1AR stimuli at higher doses decrease behavioral food consumption in rats 47 . Thus , the seemingly paradox weight gain in A1AR2 2 mice may be caused by an orexin hypocretin-induced disturbance of the hypothalamic hor-monal circadian regulation followed by increased food consumption , weight gain , obesity , and metabolic syndrome . Summary and outlook . Our data demonstrate that dis-turbed glucose tolerance is part of the phenotype of A1AR deficiency . This phenotype is accompanied by pronounced insulin resistance and possibly dysfunctional insulin secretion regulation . Our data indicate that the hypothesized effects of ADO A1AR signaling on glucose and fat metabolism , as derived from in vitro data , may not always reflect those seen in the in vivo situation . Currently available data do not allow the specification of a hypothesis to satisfactorily explain the increased body weight and total body-fat fraction of the A1AR2 2 mice . However , we hypothesize that central hypothalamic effects of the missing ADO A1AR signal on the control of food intake and energy ex-penditure dominate peripheral adipokine effects , leading to net weight gain , fat deposition , disturbed glucose tol-erance , and insulin resistance .

This cytoarchitectural feature allows for the immediate sampling of olfactory cues from the environment but also creates a vulnerability against pathogens and olfactory toxicants that may enter the nasal cavity . Indeed , OSN lifespan appears to depend on environmental conditions and the death of these cells is a relatively common event in the neuroepithelium Moulton , 1974 Hinds et al. , 1984 Mackay-Sim and Kittel , 1991 . To counter continuous OSN degeneration , and thus maintain a receptive field for the sense of smell , the olfactory neuroepithelium has sustained the ability to effectively replace its neurons throughout adult life from a basal stem ?

Ruitenberg . progenitor cell compartment Harding et al. , 1977 Graziadei et al. , 1979 Leung et al. , 2007 . Adult-born OSNs successfully regrow an axon into their central nervous system CNS target , the olfactory bulb , and restore appropriate connectivity with second-order neu-rons . Because of its accessibility , ease of manipulation and unsur-passed regenerative potential , the olfactory pathway provides an attractive model to study various aspects of neuronal injury and regeneration . Tissue macrophages play an important role during injury and subsequent regenerative events in the olfactory neuroepithelium . Macrophage numbers rapidly increase following OSN degeneration and the influx of these phagocytes coincides with the time course of neuronal death Graziadei et al. , 1979 Suzuki et al. , 1995 Cowan et al. , 2001 . In addition to removing degenerating OSNs from the neuroe-pithelium , macrophage activation and infiltration is also thought to be important for the induction and regulation of regenerative responses from the basal stem progenitor cell compartment . Appropriately activated macrophages are a rich source of factors that influence neuronal survival and stem progenitor cell proliferation e.g . Nan et al. , 2001 Borders et al. , 2007a . In line with this , macrophage depletion exacerbates neuronal death and impairs regenerative tissue responses Borders etal. , 2007b .However , the molecularmechanisms involved in the cross-talk between neurons and macrophages as well as the regulation of macrophage activation profiles remain largely unclear . We recently reported that CX3CL1 fractalkine is expressed on OSNs while its receptor , CX3CR1 , is expressed on intraepithelial macrophages and putative dendritic cells Ruitenberg et al. , 2008 Vukovic et al. , 2010 this allows for direct communication between epithelialneurons and these phagocytic immune cells . An important feature of CX3CL1 is thatit is produced in a membrane-bound form Bazanet al. , 1997 , from which the chemokine domain can be released through shedding by TACE ADAM17 and ADAM10 Garton et al. , 2001 Tsou et al. , 2001 Hundhausen et al. , 2003 . ADAM10 is thought to contribute to constitutive cleavage whereas TACE seems to mediate inducible shedding following injury or stress Hundhausen et al. , 2003 . Together , these findings suggest that the shedding of CX3CL1 and release of the chemokine module may function as an early neuronal distress signal . Here , we used comparative histological and molecular analysis between wild-type and CX3CR1-deficient mice to test this hypothesis and further elucidate the physiological importance of CX3CL1-signaling in the olfactory neuroepithelium . Results OSN death in response to bulbectomy Immunofluorescent staining for OMP was performed to visualize mature OSN numbers in tissue sections from Cx3cr1+ + and Cx3cr1gfp gfp miceat48 hafterunilateralolfactorybulbectomy OB-X Figs.1A–D .As expected , numerous OMP+ cells were found in the intermediate neuronal layer of the OE on the uninjured side , i.e. contralateral to olfactory bulbectomy , for both Cx3cr1+ + and Cx3cr1gfp gfp mice Figs . 1A and C . Ipsilateral to the ablated olfactory bulb , a dramatic decline in OMP+ neurons was observed for both genotypes Figs . 1B and D . However , an exacerbated loss and advanced state of OSN degeneration appeared evident in Cx3cr1gfp gfp mice based on fewer OMP+ cells and reduced apical dendrite expression . Quantitative counts indeed showed a decrease in the number of OMP+ cells in the target-ablated OE of Cx3cr1gfp gfp at 48 h after injury Fig. 1E n 3 per genotype , p 0.04 . These findings were also independently confirmed via the analysis of OMP gene expression in a separate set of mice Figs . 1F–H . As anticipated , OMP mRNA expression levels were dramatically reduced for both genotypes in response to OB-X when compared to uninjured controls due to the loss of mature OSNs Fig. 1F pb0.01 . However , while there was no difference in OMP expression levels between the genotypes in the control group Fig. 1G , a significantly greater 40 % reduction in OMP expression levels was seen at 48 h after injury in Cx3cr1gfp gfp mice relative to injured Cx3cr1+ + controls Fig. 1H n ? 5 per genotype , p 0.04 . A similar trend was visible at 72 h after injury but this was no longer statistically significant due to intra-group variation data not shown . Expression of ? 3-tubulin was assessed as a possible measure for immature OSN content in OE samples . There were no significant changes in ? 3-tubulin expression between the genotypes for any of the assessed timepoints although a potential trend towards reduced expression in Cx3cr1gfp gfp mice was seen at 72 h after injury Suppl . Fig. 2 . Monocyte-derived cell infiltration in response to bulbectomy The influx of cells of monocytic lineage was compared between Cx3cr1+ + , Cx3cr1gfp + and Cx3cr1gfp gfp mice at 48 h after OB-X in order to examine the influence of CX3CR1 deficiency on recruitment . To ascertain that the entire GFP+ cell population recruited to the OE was indeed of monocytic lineage , double immunofluorescent labeling for Iba1 and GFP was performed , which showed an exact overlap between the two markers Figs. 2A–C . As expected , a significant increase in the number of intraepithelial monocyte-derived cells was found in the 20 macrophages mm 15 10 5 injured side of the epithelium when compared to Iba1+ or GFP+ cell countsintheuninjuredcontralateralside Fig.2D n 3–4pergenotype and experimental condition , pb0.002 . These cells were also morpho-logically different and had , in contrast to the more dendriform cells in uninjured OE data not shown Ruitenberg et al. , 2008 Vukovic et al. , 2010 , a larger and round phagocytic appearance . Comparisons between the genotypes showed that there was a significant 27 % increase in the recruitment of monocyte-derived cells in Cx3cr1gfp gfp mice compared to both Cx3cr1+ + p 0.003 and Cx3cr1gfp + mice p 0.03 . Heterozygous Cx3cr1gfp + mice , i.e. having one mutant Cx3cr1 allele and ~50 % reduced levels of receptor expression Fig. 2E , appeared to display an intermediate phenotype under the experimental conditions and at this time point . For this reason , we resorted to using wild-type rather than Cx3cr1gfp + mice as experimental controls in all follow upexperiments . Ofnote , monocyte-derived cell counts in SHAM-operated animals showed consistently lower numbers in Cx3cr1gfp gfp mice , which is in agreement with previous findings Ruitenberg et al. , 2008 Vukovic et al. , 2010 . The quantification of CX3CR1 and GFP gene expression confirmed previous genotyping results while significantly increased expression levels pb0.01 in the target-ablated OE of the appropriate genotype were in line with histological observations , i.e. being indicative of an influx of monocyte-derived cells from the circulation Figs . 2E and F .

A typical example of the distribution and labeling intensity of BrdU+ cells inthebasallayeroftheolfactoryepitheliumipsilateraltothesideof OB-X is shown in Fig. 3A . Quantitative analysis revealed a significantly lower 35 % number of BrdU+ cells per millimeter epithelium in Cx3cr1gfp gfp mice 50±1 mean±SEM compared to their Cx3cr1+ + counterparts 77±5 n 3 per genotype , pb0.001 Fig. 3B . Prolifer-ation contralateral to the side of OB-X was significantly lower as anticipated with only 19±5 and 16±4 BrdU+ cells mean±SEM counted per millimeter in Cx3cr1+ + and Cx3cr1gfp gfp mice , respectively n 3 per genotype , pb0.001 . Comparative gene expression between wild-type and Cx3cr1gfp gfp mice Further quantitative PCR experiments were used to assess the consequences of CX3CR1 deficiency on the expression levels of selected genes in an attempt to explain the histological observations Figs. 4 and 5 . No significant difference in the expression of fractalkine CX3CL1 , i.e. the ligand for CX3CR1 was observed between genotypes at 48 h after OB-X . At 72 h after injury , a marginal but significant increase 15 % in the expression levels of CX3CL1 was observed in Cx3cr1gfp gfp compared to Cx3cr1+ + mice p 0.02 Fig. 4 . The expression of ADAM10 and TACE , the proteases that are involved in the cleavage of CX3CL1 was also assessed.TherewasnodifferenceintheexpressionofADAM10between the genotypes for any of the comparisons made . A marginally lower 16 % levelofTACEexpressionwasseenat48 hafterOB-Xin Cx3cr1gfp gfp comparedto Cx3cr1+ + mice p 0.02 butthisdifferencewasnolonger present at 72 h after injury Fig. 4 . Generally observed trends for injury responsiveness of selected genes in termsof expression levels are shown in Supplementary Fig. 3 . An analysis of the expression levels for pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF- ? , IL-6 and IL-1 ? revealed no genotype differences in uninjured control mice Fig. 5 . As a general response to bulbectomy , TNF- ? expression was greatly upregulated N10-fold regardless of genotype data not shown , pb0.001 . Similarly , IL-6 expression also appeared upregulated in response to injury but this only reached statistical significance in Cx3cr1gfp gfp mice data not shown , pb0.01 . Most importantly , there was a consistently greater increase in the expression of TNF- ? and IL-6 in Cx3cr1gfp gfp mice after bulbectomy . At 48 h after injury , there was an approximate 1.4-fold increase in TNF- ? p 0.04 and IL-6 p 0.09 expression in Cx3cr1gfp gfp mice compared to their Cx3cr1+ + counterparts . No change in IL-1 ? expression was seen at this timepoint between the genotypes pN0.4 . By 72 h , the differential expression of TNF- ? and IL-6 between Cx3cr1gfp gfp and Cx3cr1+ + mice had now increased to 2.7-and 2.4-fold , respectively p ? 0.014 . A potential trend towards the upregulated expression of IL-1 ? 1.5-fold was also detected at this time point but this did not reach statistical significance p 0.14 . Interestingly , Pearson correlation test showed that there was a direct , inverse relationship in individual samples between TNF- ? and OMP p 0.03 and IL-6 and OMP p 0.039 expression levels . Transcript levels for the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 were extremely low at the time points of 48 and 72 h after in-jury data not shown no obvious difference between genotypes was observed . Macrophage phagocytosis and CX3CR1 deficiency A link has been established in recent literature between CX3CL1 signaling and the uptake of apoptotic cells by professional phagocytes via the release of milk fat epidermal growth factor 8 MFG-E8 , an opsonin that binds to and enhances the uptake of apoptotic cells Miksa et al. , 2007 Fuller and Van Eldik , 2008 . Whilst detectable , an analysis of MFG-E8 mRNA expression levels revealed no differences between genotypes in response to OB-X at the time points investigated Fig. 6A . To further investigate the role of CX3CL1 in the clearance of apoptotic cells , the phagocytic ability of bone marrow-derived macrophages BMDMs that were isolated from either wild-type or CX3CR1-deficient mice was evaluated in vitro Fig. 6B . In the absence of CX3CL1 fractalkine , the feeding of apoptotic PC12 cells to BMDMs from Cx3cr1+ + or Cx3cr1gfp gfp mice resulted in similar baseline uptake levels between genotypes . Strikingly , the pre-incubation of wild-type BMDMs with CX3CL1 fractalkine resulted in a significantly increased uptake N3-fold of apoptotic PC12 cells compared to non-stimulated control cultures . On the other hand , macrophage cultures derived from Cx3cr1gfp gfp mice failed to respond to CX3CL1 fractalkine treatment and phagocytosis levels were not elevated from baseline control values . Discussion The present study shows that the chemokine receptor CX3CR1 plays an important role in the macrophage response to injury within the primary olfactory pathway by maintaining an environment that reduces secondary cell death and allows for neuronal replacement from endogenous stem progenitor cells . After bulbectomy , the vast majority of the mature OMP+ olfactory sensory neurons in the olfactory epithelium dies via retrograde apoptosis Cowan et al. , 2001 , resulting in macrophage recruitment and general thinning of the epithelium Suzuki et al. , 1995 Verhaagen et al. , 1990 . We found B OE *** mm cells 40 mice . Bars represent the mean±SEM asterisks indicate pb0.05 . * gfp gfp n 5 * A MFG-E8 0.10 B -index that CX3CR1-deficient mice displayed an exaggerated inflammatory response in response to olfactory bulbectomy as evidenced by increased recruitment of monocyte-derived cells and elevated expression levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines within the olfactory neuroepithelium . Interestingly , these changes were accompanied by an accelerated loss of olfactory sensory neurons and reduced proliferation within the basal stem progenitor cell compartment of the olfactory neuroepithelium , indicating a key role for the fractalk-ine–CX3CR1 axis in tissue maintenance and repair in the olfactory pathway . Increased presence of monocyte-derived cells in the olfactory epithelium after injury As anticipated , the number of intraepithelial macrophages was increased for both Cx3cr1+ + and Cx3cr1gfp gfp afterolfactory bulbectomy when compared to the uninjured contralateral side . This finding is in agreement with previous studies since macrophages are actively recruited to the epithelium and assist in the clearance of apoptotic olfactory sensory neurons after injury Suzuki et al. , 1995 Nan et al. , 2001 . Macrophage infiltration was also evident from the qPCR data on wild-type and Cx3cr1gfp mice , which showed relative increases in the expression of CX3CR1 and GFP mRNAs in target-ablated olfactory epithelium for Cx3cr1+ + , Cx3cr1gfp + and Cx3cr1gfp gfp mice compared to uninjured control samples . This increase in CX3CR1 expression in response to injury furthers supports our findings on recruitment of monocyte-derived cells in the olfactory epithelium as confirmed by histological examination . We have previously reported a reduction in the number of monocyte-derived cells in the olfactory neuroepithelium as a result of CX3CR1 deficiency under homeostatic conditions Ruitenberg et al. , 2008 Vukovic et al. , 2010 . In the present study , direct comparison between genotypes revealed , however , more intraepithelial macro-phages 27 % increase in Cx3cr1gfp gfp as compared to Cx3cr1+ + mice following injury . This finding is novel as most previous studies have focused on the role of fractalkine signaling in regulating the activation profile of macrophages and or CNS microglia but not investigated its role in the recruitment of cells of monocytic lineage to areas of neural tissue injury and degeneration e.g . Cardona et al. , 2006 . The complete overlap between Iba1 and GFP immunostaining patterns in Cx3cr1gfp gfp mice excludes the possibility that an additional Iba1 ? GFP+ cell population was recruited , which otherwise could have accounted for the observed increase in intraepithelial macrophages . Thus , lack of fractalkine CX3CL1 signaling results in increased recruitment of macro-phage-like cells with more inflammatory potential to the olfactory epithelium after injury . Such a finding is in line with the current scientific view that fractalkine CX3CL1 signaling is anti-inflammatory or immunomodulatory in the nervous system for review Savarin-Vuaillat and Ransohoff , 2007 . Deficiency in CX3CR1 impairs phagocytosis of apoptotic cells in vitro Based on several reports detailing an emerging role for fractalkine in phagocytosis Leonardi-Essmann et al. 2005 Miksa et al. 2007 Fuller and VanEldik 2008 Truman et al. , 2008 Lee et al. , 2010 Liu etal. , 2010 , and the fact that increased leukocyte recruitment can be indicative of impairedphagocytosis , theimpactof CX3CR1-deficiencyontheabilityof BM-derived macrophages to phagocytize apoptotic cells was investi-gated . Fractalkine secretion from dying , apoptotic cells is thought to contribute to macrophage recruitment in order to allow for their proper disposal Truman et al. 2008 . Fractalkine signaling stimulates the release of MFG-E8by macrophages , whichinturnactsasanopsonin and thus facilitates rapid clearance of apoptotic cells for enhanced phagocytosis Fuller and Van Eldik 2008 Leonardi-Essmann et al. 2005 Miksa et al. 2007 . We were able to confirm these reports by showing in vitro that stimulation of BM-derived macrophages with fractalkine indeed leads to a significant increase in phagocytic cell uptake . Further expanding on these findings we have also demonstrat-ed , to our knowledge for the first time , that this effect is specific to the signaling of fractalkine through CX3CR1 since Cx3cr1gfp gfp macrophages failed to show a similar increase in phagocytosis in response to fractalkine treatment and exposure to apoptotic PC12 cells . The baseline phagocytic activity of Cx3cr1gfp gfp macrophages , i.e. prior to or without stimulation with fractalkine , did not differ from wild-type counterparts . TUNEL staining of olfactory neuroepithelium at 48 h after bulbect-omy did , however , not reveal signs of delayed apoptotic cell clearance in Cx3cr1gfp gfp mice in vivo data not shown . These findings therefore suggest that , in the absence of fractalkine signaling through CX3CR1 , other signals provide functional redundancy in relation to phagocytosis in an in vivo context . The possibility that slight delays in clearance of apoptotic cells under CX3CR1-deficient conditions may have resulted in leakage of potentially neurotoxic and antigenic substances from dying cells , which in turn could have partially contributed to the increased inflammatory responses in Cx3cr1gfp gfp mice , can not be excluded and shouldbeexaminedinfutureexperiments GrimsleyandRavichandran , 2003 . Increased expression of pro-inflammatory factors in CX3CR1-deficient olfactory epithelium negatively affects cell survival and proliferation To further examine the consequences of CX3CR1-deficiency at the molecular level , the expression levels of selected genes were investigatedbetweengenotypes and inresponsetoinjury . ADAM10and TACE are enzymes that cleave membrane-bound fractalkine CX3CL1 , which releases the chemokine module Garton et al. , 2001 Tsou et al. , 2001 Hundhausen et al. , 2003 . ADAM10 expression was upregulated in response to injury , which is supportive of increased shedding and bioavailability of soluble fractalkine CX3CL1 under conditions of cellular stress or injury . There was no acute change in TACE expression in response to injury except a small increase for the wild-type mice 72 h after injury . No differences in expression levels were observed between genotypes , suggesting that CX3CR1 deficiency in itself did not profoundly affect the expression levels of any of these genes in response to injury . There was a general trend for increased expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the olfactory epithelium after injury regardless of genotype . However , increased expression levels of TNF- ? and IL-6 were observed in Cx3cr1gfp gfp mice at 48 h after injury compared to wild-type controls . No such differences between geno-types were present in the baseline expression levels of these genes in unchallenged mice . By 72 h , differential TNF- ? and IL-6 expression between Cx3cr1gfp gfp compared to Cx3cr1+ + mice was even more pronounced , with the observed differences in excess of 2-fold . These findings are in agreement with reports of increased pro-inflammatory cytokine expression in challenged or diseased brain under CX3CR1-deficienctconditions Cardonaet al. , 2006 .Conversely , fractalkine itself hasbeenshowntobeabletoinhibittheproductionof pro-inflammatory cytokines in vitro Mizuno et al. , 2003 . Our data on increased macrophage recruitment under CX3CR1-deficient mice suggests that , at least under certain experimental conditions , part of this increase might be relative rather than absolute . Finally , in contrast to the findings of Cardona et al. 2006 , only a trend towards upregulated IL-1 ? expression was observed at the 72-hour time point . Together , these findings point towards a role for CX3CR1 in regulation of the inflammatory response to injury in the olfactory pathway with important implications for both neuronal survival and replacement . Specifically , TNF- ? is known to induce neuronal apoptosis in organo-typic cultures of the olfactory epithelium Farbman et al. , 1999 Suzuki and Farbman , 2000 . This study supports these findings in vivo and provides evidence that fractalkine CX3CL1 signaling can contribute to neuroprotection by modulating macrophage recruitment and or TNF- ? expression . IL-1 ? has also generally been associated with neurodegen-eration in vivo Rothwell , 2003 . Indeed , increased and or accelerated deathof olfactoryreceptorneuronswasobservedin Cx3cr1gfp gfp miceon the basis of quantitative cell counts . Further indicative of more neuronal cell death in Cx3cr1gfp gfp mice were the significantly lower OMP gene expression levels , which in turn was inversely correlated to the expression level of pro-inflammatory cytokines . These findings dem-onstrate that the relative increase in TNF- ? , IL-6 , and perhaps , IL-1 ? levels , as a result of CX3CR1-deficiency , directly contributed to neuronal cell death . Finally , TNF- ? , IL-6 and IL-1 ? are all capable of inhibiting neurogenesis e.g . Ekdahl et al. , 2003 Monje et al. , 2003 Wang et al. , 2007 Koo and Duman , 2008 , which can thus negatively affect the regenerative response to injury . Taken together , these observations directly support an important role for fractalkine CX3CL1 and its receptor , CX3CR1 , in regulation of the inflammatory response to injury and the maintenance of an environment that is optimal for neuronal survival and replacement . To investigate whether CX3CR1-deficiency could indeed impair or delay the process of epithelial regeneration , pulse labeling with BrdU was used to investigate the proliferative response to injury within the basal stem progenitor cell compartment . The putative detrimental effects of increased pro-inflammatory cytokine expression on epithe-lial neurogenesis after OB-X and under CX3CR1-deficient conditions became indeed apparent by a significant reduction in the number of proliferating basal progenitor cells in Cx3cr1gfp gfp mice . A positive role for fractalkine signaling in the process of adult neurogenesis is in line with the study of Bachstetter et al. 2009 , which reported on the importance of this chemokine in relation to hippocampal neurogen-esis and aging . Expression levels of ? 3-tubulin also appeared to be slightly reduced at 72 h after injury in Cx3cr1gfp gfp mice but additional histological analysis is needed in future experiments , perhaps at additional later time points , to confirm whether the immature population of olfactory sensory neurons is also negatively affected in its survival or proliferation under CX3CR1-deficient conditions . Previous reports have revealed that macrophages in the olfactory epithelium are necessary for olfactory sensory neuron survival and play a decisive role in successful regeneration of the olfactory epithelium after injury in vivo Borders et al. , 2007a , b . However , the molecular evaluation performed in this study reveals that the inappropriate activation of those very same cells can lead to elevated gene expression of TNF- ? , IL-6 and possibly IL-1 ? . All of these pro-inflammatory cytokines have been associated with neuronal death and reduced neurogenesis Monje et al. , 2003 Block et al. , 2007 . In summary , signaling through the fractalkine–CX3CR1 axis therefore seems to play an important role in maintaining a microenvironment that permits the controlled activation of professional scavengers and subsequent clearance of degenerating neurons from the epithelium whilst simultaneously allowing for appropriate stem progenitor cell activation so that successful neurogenesis can occur . Experimental methods Experimental animals A total of 74 C57BL 6J mice ? ? 2–4 months of age were used in this study . Wild-type Cx3cr1+ + , heterozygous Cx3cr1gfp + and homozygous knock-in Cx3cr1gfp gfp mice were generated from heterozygous Cx3cr1gfp breeding pairs Jung et al. , 2000 . In Cx3cr1gfp mice , the coding sequence for enhanced green fluorescent protein eGFP was inserted into the Cx3cr1 coding region via targeted deletion , i.e. rendering the CX3CL1 fractalkine receptor non-functional and placing eGFP under Cx3cr1 promoter control in the targeted allele . All mice were kept on a 12 h light dark cycle and had free access to food and water . All procedures were approved by the Animal Ethics Committee of The University of Western Australia and in accordance with guidelines of the National Health and Medical Research Council NHMRC for animal handling and experimentation . Surgical procedures Unilateral removal of the olfactory bulb i.e. target ablation OB-X was used to induce the retrograde apoptotic death of OSNs in the ipsilateral olfactory neuroepithelium Cowan et al. , 2001 . For this , experimental mice were anesthetized with 3 % Avertin 2,2,2-tribromoethanol , 300 mg kg Sigma-Aldrich , Sydney , NSW , Australia and kept on a warm plate . Next , hair was removed using hair clippers andtheskinoverlayingthetargetareawipedwith70 % ethanol.Ascalpel blade was used to generate a rostrocaudal incision and a hole drilled through the bone at the level of the right olfactory bulb . Once exposed , the caudal part of the olfactory bulb was carefully separated from the forebrain with a sharpened 27-gauge needle after which the olfactory bulb was removed using vacuum aspiration . The resulting cavity was filled with a piece of sterile gelfoam and the incision sewn up . Sham-operated mice were subjected to craniotomy only . Post-operatively , all animals received a subcutaneous injection of 0.2 mL saline 0.9 % NaCl and buprenorphine 0.05 mg kg Reckitt and Colman , Hull , UK after which they were returned to their original cages for recovery . Animals that were processed for histological analysis received an intraperitoneal injection of 5-bromo-2 ? -deoxyuridine BrdU , Sigma-Aldrich 100 mg kg exactly 2 h before being euthanized . Immunostaining procedures Tissue collection and processing Forty-eight hours after surgery , mice were deeply anesthetized with sodium pentobarbitone 100 mg kg Virbac , Milperra , NSW , Australia after which they were transcardially perfused with 10 mL of saline and 30 mL of 4 % paraformaldehyde PFA in 0.1 M phosphate-buffer pH7.4 , respectively . The olfactory neuroepithelium and bulb were carefully dissected out , post-fixed overnight and then further incubated in 250 mM EDTA in 100 mM phosphate-buffered saline pH 7.4 PBS for 12–14 h at 4 °C for decalcification . Specimens were cryoprotected via overnight incubations in 10 % and 30 % sucrose in PBS , followed by snap freezing in dry-ice cooled isopentane . Tissue samples were stored at ? 80 °C until further processing . Horizontal sections 20 ? m , 1 4 series through the olfactory neuroepithelium and bulb were cut on a cryostat and collected on SuperFrost Plus slides Menzel-Gläser , Braunschweig , Germany . Sections were air-dried for 2 h and stored at ? 80 °C until processing . Staining procedures For immunohistochemistry , slides were rehydrated in PBS and incubatedfor30 minatroomtemperature RT withPBScontaining10 % methanol and 0.6 % H2O2 to quench endogenous peroxidase activity . After three rounds of washings , sections were blocked and permeabi-lized for 1 h at RT in blocking solution antibody diluent , i.e. 0.2 % v v Triton X-100 and 2 % w v of bovine serum albumine BSA Sigma-Aldrich in PBS . This solution was used during all incubation steps . To visualize intraepithelial macrophages , sections were incubated over-night at 4 °C with rabbit anti-ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule 1 Iba1 Wako Pure Chemical Industries , Osaka , Japan 1 250 for wild-type mice , or rabbit anti-GFP Millipore , North Ryde , NSW , Australia 1 200 for Cx3cr1gfp + and Cx3cr1gfp gfp mice . Visualization of BrdU-labeled cells required additional pre-treatment with 2N HCl for 45 min at 37 °C and use of BEATTM blocker kit Zymed Laboratories Inc. , San Francisco , CA , USA as per manufacturer s instructions prior to incuba-tion with monocloncal mouse anti-BrdU antibody Roche Diagnostics , Castle Hill , NSW , Australia 1 100 . The following day , slides were washed three times in PBS and incubated with appropriate biotinylated secondary antibody , i.e. goat anti-rabbit or anti-rat Vector Laboratories , Burlingame , CA , USA 1 200 for 1 h at RT. Slides were then washed again and further incubated for 1 h at RT with Vectastain Elite ABC reagent 1 400 Vector Laboratories . Staining was developed after washing by incubation with 3 , 3-diaminobenzidine DAB Sigma-Aldrich in the presence of 0.01 % H2O2 for 5 min at RT . Sections were counterstained with hematoxylin , dehydrated through a graded series of ethanol , tolueneand , finally , coverslipedwithDPXmountingmedium Sigma-Aldrich . Staining specificity was confirmed via the omission of primary antibody incubation step or appropriate isotype control antibodies not shown . Immunofluorescent staining was performed to ascertain co-localization of GFP signal with Iba1 immunoreactivity in Cx3cr1gfp + and Cx3cr1gfp gfp mice and to visualize mature , olfactory marker protein OMP -positive OSNs . Slides were washed three times in PBS , incubated with blocking solution for 1 h at RT and additional BEATTM blocker kit treatment where applicable . Slides were then incubated overnight at 4 °C with a combination of rabbit anti-Iba1 1 250 and monoclonal mouse anti-GFP Millipore 1 100 , or goat anti-OMP Wako Pure Chemical Industries 1 1000 . The next day , sections were washed in PBS and incubated for 1 h at RT with a mixture of biotinylated goat anti-rabbit 1 400 and Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse Invitrogen , Mount Waverley , VIC , Australia 1 400 , or biotinylated donkey anti-goat Vector Laboratories 1 400 . After washing , sections were incubated with Alexa Fluor 546-conjugated streptavidin Invitrogen 1 400 for 1 h at RT. Unbound staining reagents were removed via another round of washings in PBS before coverslipping in fluorescent mounting medium DakoCytomation , Glostrup , Denmark containing Hoechst 33342 nuclear dye Sigma-Aldrich . Fluorescence microscopy was used to visualize the staining and images were captured at maximum signal intensity on a Leica TCS SP2 Multiphoton Confocal Microscope Centre for Microscopy , Characterisation and Analysis , The University of Western Australia . Quantitative cell counts The number of eGFP+ , Iba1+ and BrdU+ cells in olfactory neuroepithelium of Cx3cr1+ + , Cx3cr1gfp + and Cx3cr1gfp gfp mice was calculated from masked , quantitative counts at defined , equally spaced levels along the dorso-ventral axis of the septum Vukovic et al. , 2009 . For GFP+ and Iba1+cell counts , tiled images of olfactory neuroepithe-lium from either side of the nasal septum were captured at 200 ? magnification using ImagePro Plus software Media Cybernetics , Bethesda , MD , USA . Only those cells that were located within the olfactoryneuroepithelium i.e. excludingthe underlyinglaminapropria and had a clearly identifiable cell body were counted . The length of the analyzed segment of olfactory neuroepithelium was determined by tracing along the basement membrane . Data were expressed as the number of immunoreactive cells per unit length of olfactory neuroe-pithelium , both ipsi-and contralateral to the site of OB-X . Calculated values for each level were averaged first to generate animal means . On average , 13±1 mean±SEM millimeter mm of olfactory neuroe-pithelium was investigated per experimental animal . For proliferative cell counts , sections were visualized at 600 ? magnification and the number of BrdU+ nuclei counted through the z-axis using Stereo-Investigator software MBF Bioscience , Willistone , VT , USA . Counts for mature OMP+ OSN numbers in the olfactory neuroe-pitheliumof Cx3cr1+ + and Cx3cr1gfp gfp micewereobtainedasdescribed previously Vukovic et al. , 2009 . In brief , confocal images of target-ablated septal olfactory neuroepithelium were captured at 630 ? magnification . Next , the number of OMP+ neurons with a distinct cell body per unit area mm2 was counted in ImagePro relative to the total Hoechst+ cell number . For each animal , a total length of 1430 ? m of olfactory neuroepithelium was analyzed . No difference in epithelial thickness measurements were observed between groups data not shown . RNA isolation and quantitative PCR and Cx3cr1gfp gfp mice were killed by cervical dislocation and olfactory neuroepithelium harvested from the caudal nasal septum i.e. perpendicular plate of the ethmoid bone at 48 and 72 h post-injury . Each tissue sample was weighed and subsequently stored in ice-cold RNAlaterTM solution Ambion , Austin , TX , USA for a maximum duration of 1 h until further processing . On average , 2.04±0.36 and 1.23±0.36 mg of tissue mean±SEM was harvested for control and target-ablated septum , respectively no significant differences in yield were observed between genotypes . Total RNA isolation was per-formed using RNeasy micro kit Qiagen , Doncaster , VIC , Australia according to manufacturer s instructions and with the inclusion of optional DNase treatment . Obtained RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA using SuperScript III enzyme Invitrogen . The amount of RNA used for reverse transcription was based on the group sample with lowest RNA yield . Specific to the experimental groups , 650 ng control , 550 ng OB-X , 48 h and 500 ng OB-X , 72 h of RNA was used from each sample of neuroepithelium . Resultant cDNA was purified using a PCR Clean-up kit MO BIO Laboratories , Carlsbad , CA , USA and stored at ? 20 °C until further use . Quantitative analysis of gene expression in samples of olfactory neuroepithelium was performed via real-time PCR using the Rotor-Gene 3000 system Qiagen . In brief , primer pairs were designed using Primer3 software Rozen and Skaletsky , 2000 Table 1 , followed by NCBI BLAST searching against the mouse genome to ensure specificity . External standards were generated from 10-fold serial dilutions of regular PCR products for each of the selected genes 1–107-fold dilutions . All reactions were performed in 10 ? l volumes using IQ SYBR Green master mix Bio-Rad Laboratories , Hercules , CA , USA , 0.5 ? M primer concentration and 1 ? l sample cDNA . PCR cycling conditions included initial denaturation at 95 °C for 3 min , followed Table 1 Primers used for genotyping and real time PCR . Gene Forward primer 5 ? –3 ? TACE GTA CGT CGA TGC AGA GCA AA Adam10 GAT GAC TAC TGC CTG GCC TA by 40–50 cycles at 95 °C for 1 s , 50–60 °C for 10 s annealing and 72 °C for 15 s elongation . Melt curve analysis 70–99 °C showed a single PCR product size and identity were confirmed by gel electrophoresis as well as sequence analysis not shown . In addition to H2O control , a ‘non-reverse transcribed’ sample , i.e. no RT control , was included at all times to check for genomic DNA contamination . A standard curve was used to quantify the relative amount of transcript in each sample . Obtained fluorescence values were averaged between duplicates and normalized against the expression levels of L19 , a mitochondrial ribosomal protein , which was used as an internal control L19 expression was not regulated in response to injury or genotype data not shown . Phagocytosis assay Bone marrow-derived macrophage BMDM preparations were obtained from wild-type and Cx3cr1gfp mice using established methods Longbrake et al. , 2007 Weischenfeldt and Porse , 2008 . In brief , the tibia and femur bones were dissected , the epiphyses cut off and the BM flushed out with cold RPMI 1640 medium Sigma . After centrifugation , the remaining pellet was gently resuspended and triturated in growth medium RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 20 % fetal bovine serum FBS , 1 mM sodium pyruvate , 0.001 % ? -mercaptoethanol , 1 % penicillin streptomycin P S Sigma-Aldrich and 40 ng ml M-CSF PeproTech Asia , Rehovot , Israel and filtered through a 70 ? m cell strainer . Cells were then plated onto glass coverslips and left for 7 days to differentiate cultures were washed and given fresh growth medium every 2–3 days . Twenty-four hours prior to phagocytosis experiments , cells were switched to growth medium without M-CSF and , where applicable , 100 ng ml CX3CL1 R D Systems , Minneapolis , MN , USA . Purity andimmunophenotypewereexamined viastainingwithratanti-mouse CD11b 1 200 R D Systems , anti-Iba1 , and eGFP fluorescence Cx3cr1gfp mice only . Phagocytosis experiments were performed using the methods of Miksa et al. 2007 . In brief , PC12 neuroblastoma cells were cultured for 24 h in DMEM medium containing 10 % horse serum , 5 % FBS , 0.2 % P S , 1 % non-essential amino acids Sigma-Aldrich and , for induction of apoptosis , in the presence of 2 ? M staurosporine Sigma-Aldrich . This procedure yielded 30–50 % apoptotic cells as determined by nuclear fragmentation and staining for cleaved caspase-3 R D Systems see Supplementary Fig. 1 . After 24 h , cells were gently detached , washed and resuspended in macrophage growth RPMI 1640 medium . Suspended PC12 cells apoptotic targets were added to macrophage preparations 4 1 and the cells incubated together for exactly 1 h . Macrophage cultures were then thoroughly washed with PBS to remove unbound and loosely adherent cells , followed by 20 min fixation with 3 % PFA in PBS . To assess uptake of apoptotic PC12 cells by macrophages , terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase nick-end labeling TUNEL staining was used to visualize cellular debris within phagosomes . Pictures were taken from ? 10 randomly selected fields across the coverslip at 200 ? magnification and then coded for masked analysis in ImagePro . The phagocytosis of apoptotic PC12 cells i.e. cells with TUNEL+ phagosomes relative to the total number of macrophages was assessed while the experimenter was blinded to the experimental condition . The phagocytosis index was calculated and expressed as the percentage change from the baseline control condition i.e. wild-type BMDM without CX3CL1 stimulation . Results were verified in three independent experimental repeats . In total , over 10,000 cells were counted with no statistical differences in terms of the cell numbers analyzed between the experimental groups . Statistical analysis Data were analyzed for statistically significant differences between genotypes using parametric student t-test and or non-parametric Mann–Whitney U test comparisons as well as ANOVA with post-hoc Newman–Keuls test for multiple group comparisons . Data sets were considered significantly different from each other if p ? 0.05 . Supplementary materials related to this article can be found online at doi 10.1016 j.mcn.2011.08.004 .

21873554	RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS—Mice with adipocyte - Iandexpanding n obesity , oxygen supply can not meet the demand of adipose , resulting in relative hypoxia within adipose tissue , increased lactate production , hypoperfusion in both obese human and animal models 1,2 . Hypoxia was found to cause insulin resistance in 3T3-L1 adipocytes and human subcutaneous abdominal adipocytes 3 . However , the role of hypoxia in adipose tissue during obesity and insulin resistance remains un-clear . Regulation of hypoxia-mediated responses is mainly dependent on the hypoxia-inducible factor HIF family . HIFs are nuclear transcription factors and function as oxygen-sensitive a subunit and b heterodimers ARNT . All isoforms of HIFa , HIF1a , HIF2a , and HIF3a require the ubiquitously expressed subunit aryl hydrocarbon nuclear translocator ARNT or HIF1b as an obligate heterodimer-ization partner for activation of target genes . HIF1a , HIF2a , HIF3a , and ARNT are all expressed in adipose tissue 4–6 . HIF function is primarily regulated by HIF1a protein sta-bility . Under normoxia , HIF1a is hydroxylated by pro-lylhydroxylase PHD . Following hydroxylation , HIF1a is ubiquitinated by the E3 ubiquitin ligase , von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor VHL and degraded via the protea-some pathway . Conversely , under hypoxia , hydroxylation is inhibited , leading to stabilization of the a subunit , heterodimerization with ARNT , and activation of HIF target genes 7 . To investigate the role of hypoxia in obesity and insulin resistance , adipocyte-specific ARNT knockout Arnt ? Adipo mice and adipocyte-specific HIF1a knockout Hif1a ? Adipo mice were generated with the Cre LoxP system using the adipose-specific aP2-Cre transgene 8 . Both mouse lines exhibit similar metabolic phenotypes , including reduced fat formation , protection from high-fat diet HFD -induced obesity , and insulin resistance , suggesting a role for HIF1 in the pathogenesis of obesity and insulin resistance . Taken together , the findings of this study reveal an essential role of HIF1a in controlling adipose mass and function and provide a potential therapeutic target of obesity and insulin resistance . RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS In vivo insulin stimulation and analysis of insulin signaling . Mice were Body composition , food intake , and metabolic rate . Body composition was Isolation of adipocytes and macrophage of stromal vascular fraction RESULTS Generation and characterization of Arnt ? Adipo and Hif1a ? Adipo mice . For examination of the role of HIF transcription factors in obesity and insulin resistance , Arnt and Hif1a genes were disrupted in adipocytes . To esti-mate the extent of cell-specific disruption of the Arnt and Hif1a loci , PCR analysis was used . A PCR amplicon for the Arnt-null allele amplified as a 340 base pair product and was detected in genomic DNA isolated from adipo-cytes or adipose tissue of Arnt ? Adipo mice and not in adipose DNA isolated from ArntF F mice . In contrast , the floxed allele was the only band detected in adipose tissue from ArntF F mice and from all nonadipose tissues in Arnt ? Adipo mice Fig. 1A . The Hif1a-null amplicon ampli-fied as a 355 base pair product was detected in genomic DNA isolated from adipose tissue of Hif1a ? Adipo mice , and was not detected in adipose tissue DNA isolated from Hif1aF F mice . The null allele was only detected in adipose tissue and not in liver , skeletal muscle , spleen , or kidney from Hif1a ? Adipo mice Fig. 1B . The expression of Arnt mRNA was specifically decreased in WAT and brown adi-pose tissue BAT by 50 % in the Arnt ? Adipo mice compared with ArntF F mice no decrease was evident from liver or skeletal muscle . In addition , qPCR showed nearly absent expression of ARNT mRNA in the adipocytes of Arnt ? Adipo mice Fig. 1C . Similar results were obtained from tissues of Hif1a ? Adipo mice , where an ~88 % decrease in HIF1a mRNA from adipocytes was observed Fig. 1D . Nuclear ARNT protein expression in Arnt ? Adipo mice was also markedly decreased Supplementary Fig. 1A . To confirm that loss of ARNT was of functional significance , the ex-tent of activation of the ARNT-dependent aryl hydrocarbon receptor AhR pathway upon 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin TCDD challenge was determined . Induction of the AHR target gene Cyp1a1 was markedly attenuated in WAT and BAT of Arnt ? Adipo mice Supplementary Fig. 1B and C . However , no significant difference in the extent of in-duction of CYP1A1 mRNA was noted in liver or skeletal muscle compared with ArntF F mice Supplementary Fig. 1D and E . These results demonstrate adipocyte-specific knockout of the Arnt and Hif1a genes in mice . Arnt ? Adipo or Hif1a ? Adipo mice are resistant to diet - induced weight gain . To explore the role of HIF1 in fat metabolism and glucose homeostasis , male mice were fed either a chow diet or HFD . When fed a chow diet , Arnt ? Adipo and Hif1a ? Adipo mice grew at a rate similar to that of ArntF F and Hif1aF F mice , respectively . However , 12 weeks of HFD led to weight gain in ArntF F and Hif1aF F mice , while Arnt ? Adipo and Hif1a ? Adipo mice were resistant to the HFD-induced weight gain Supplementary Fig. 2A Fig. 2A . NMR measurements confirmed that the body fat mass and the ratio of fat and body mass of Arnt ? Adipo and Hif1a ? Adipo mice fed an HFD were decreased compared with ArntF F and Hif1aF F mice , respectively Supplemen-tary Fig. 2B Fig. 2B . The adipocyte size in Arnt ? Adipo and Hif1a ? Adipo mice was significantly decreased compared with ArntF F and Hif1aF F mice , respectively , after 12 weeks of HFD Supplementary Fig. 2C Fig. 2C . To explore the mechanism of reduced adiposity in Arnt ? Adipo and Hif1a ? Adipo mice , cumulative food intake , metabolic effi-ciency , and metabolic rates were measured in young mice maintained on chow diet and in mice fed an HFD for 4–7 weeks , which is before the difference between control and mutant mice became apparent . There were no significant differences in weight , cumulative food intake , or metabolic efficiency between Hif1aF F and Hif1a ? Adipo mice main-tained on chow diet Supplementary Fig. 3A–C . Similarly , indirect calorimetry performed at 24°C and thermoneu-trality 30°C on the same set of mice did not reveal sig-nificant differences in metabolic rate , respiratory exchange ratio RER , or activity between Hif1aF F and Hif1a ? Adipo mice fed chow diet Supplementary Fig. 3D . A short 4-day exposure to HFD caused comparable increases in body weight and resting metabolic rate in Hif1aF F and Hif1a ? Adipo mice , indicating that adipose-specific inacti-vation of Hif1a did not alter the acute thermogenic re-sponse to HFD Supplementary Fig. 3E and F . These results indicate that it takes a long time for the adipose tissue to get big enough to be hypoxic and that Hif1a ex-pression was significantly induced , resulting in activation of HIF1 target genes such as Vegf and Glut1 Supplementary Fig. 7 . After 4–6 weeks on an HFD , the cumulative food intake remained similar between Hif1aF F and Hif1a ? Adipo mice however , the metabolic efficiency was lower in the Hif1a ? Adipo mice , suggesting an increase in the metabolic rate Fig. 3A . Indirect calorimetry performed at 24°C on week 7 of HFD did not reveal a significant difference in resting or total oxygen consumption between the geno-types , while at 30°C these parameters tended to be higher in Hif1a ? Adipo mice compared with controls Supplemen-tary Fig. 3G . Hif1a ? Adipo mice had reduced resting and total RER at 30°C during resting phase daytime and active phase nighttime , suggesting increased fatty acid oxidation Fig. 3C and D and a tendency toward increased activity Fig. 3E and F . All of these changes in Hif1a ? Adipo mice could contribute to the decreased metabolic effi-ciency and weight gain on an HFD compared with Hif1aF F mice . However , it is unlikely that resistance to HFD was caused by activated BAT thermogenesis because the re-sponse to mild cold measured as the difference in meta-bolic rate at thermoneutral and room temperature and the response to a maximal dose of the b3-adrenergic ag-onist CL316243 , which specifically stimulates BAT ther-mogenesis , were similar in both strains Supplementary Fig. 3H . HIF1 deficiency in adipocytes improves HFD-induced glucose intolerance and insulin resistance . To explore the role of adipocyte HIF1 deficiency in obesity-induced insulin resistance , GTTs and ITTs were performed . When mice were fed a chow diet , there were no significant dif-ferences in GTT and ITT between ArntF F and Arnt ? Adipo mice Supplementary Fig. 4A and C . However , GTT re-vealed that after 11 weeks of HFD challenge , Arnt ? Adipo and Hif1a ? Adipo mice displayed significantly reduced blood glucose compared with ArntF F and Hif1aF F mice after glucose loading Supplementary Fig. 4B Fig. 4A . Moreover , serum insulin was significantly decreased in Hif1a ? Adipo mice during GTT Fig. 4B . ITT showed a significant im-provement in insulin sensitivity by adipose HIF1 disruption Supplementary Fig. 4D Fig. 4C . Moreover , fed glucose , fasted glucose , and fasted serum insulin levels were sig-nificantly lower in Arnt ? Adipo and Hif1a ? Adipo mice com-pared with ArntF F and Hif1aF F mice , respectively , after 12 weeks of HFD . The calculated homeostasis model as-sessment HOMA measure of insulin resistance was sig-nificantly decreased in Arnt ? Adipo and Hif1a ? Adipo mice Table 1 . Arnt ? Adipo and Hif1a ? Adipo mice also had reduced fasted serum triglycerides and FFA levels consistent with improved glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity in these mice Table 1 . Although body mass was similar between Hif1aF F and Hif1a ? Adipo mice after 4 weeks , 6 weeks , and 8 weeks of HFD , GTT and ITT revealed that glucose toler-ance and insulin sensitivity were improved in Hif1a ? Adipo mice from 4 weeks on an HFD Supplementary Fig. 5A and B . After 6 weeks of HFD challenge , fasted glucose was similar while fasted insulin levels and HOMA index in Hif1a ? Adipo mice were significantly decreased Sup-plementary Fig. 5C . These results indicated that HIF1 disruption in adipocytes improved HFD-induced glucose tolerance and insulin resistance before the onset of the decrease in body mass . A hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp was performed in Hif1aF F and Hif1a ? Adipo mice after 15 weeks of HFD to further characterize in vivo insulin action . In the basal state , Hif1a ? Adipo mice had significantly reduced plasma glucose and insulin levels basal endogenous glucose pro-duction EGP was similar between genotypes Fig. 4D–F and H . During the clamp , insulin was infused to maintain plasma insulin levels at 4 ng mL Fig. 4F , and the glu-cose infusion rate GIR was adjusted in order to main-tain blood glucose levels in Hif1a F F and Hif1a ? Adipo mice at similar levels Fig. 4D , E , and G . GIR was significantly increased in Hif1a ? Adipo mice Fig. 4G and H , which confirmed improved whole-body insulin sensitivity in Hif1a ? Adipo mice . During the clamp , insulin induced a more marked suppression of EGP in Hif1a ? Adipo mice , suggesting increased insulin sensitivity in the liver . Whole-body glucose disposal Rd and glucose uptake into skel-etal muscle and adipose tissue were significantly increased in Hif1a ? Adipo mice Fig. 4H . Taken together , these data suggest that adipose selective inactivation of HIF1 caused increased insulin sensitivity in major insulin target tissues , liver , skeletal muscle , and fat . Insulin action was further investigated in WAT , liver , and skeletal muscle 15 . Both ARNT and HIF1a deficiency in adipocytes improved insulin signaling pathways in WAT , liver , and skeletal muscle , as revealed by increased phos-phorylation of Akt ser473 Fig. 5A–C . These findings indicated that HIF1 deficiency in adipocytes improved HFD-induced glucose tolerance and insulin resistance , which is in support of the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp studies . Expression of genes altered in ARNT-and HIF1 - deficient adipose tissue . After 12 weeks of HFD , HIF1a was significantly elevated , resulting in activation of target genes such as Glut1 and Vegf Supplementary Fig. 6A . On a chow diet , HIF1 target genes and adiponectin expression were similar between Hif1aF F and Hif1a ? Adipo mice Sup-plementary Fig. 6B . In addition , there was no significant nuclear HIF1a protein expression in WAT from chow-fed wild-type mice , while it was significantly induced in HFD-fed mice and diminished in Hif1a ? Adipo mice Supplementary Fig. 6C . Thus , the phenotype of Hif1a ? Adipo mice is similar to Hif1aF F mice on a chow diet but different on an HFD . In contrast to HIF1a protein , HFD treatment did not el-evate HIF2a protein expression and there was no in-crease in Hif1a ? Adipo mice Supplementary Fig. 6C . Gene expression profiling of WAT after 12 weeks of HFD in ArntF F and Arnt ? Adipo mice or Hif1aF F and Hif1a ? Adipo mice showed that the HIF1 target genes Glut1 and Vegf were decreased in Arnt ? Adipo and Hif1a ? Adipo mice Sup-plementary Table 1 Supplementary Fig. 7A Fig. 6A . Expression of genes involved in adipogenesis and glucose metabolism , Pparg , C EBPa , Cfd , and Glut4 , were upreg - ulated in WAT of Arnt ? Adipo and Hif1a ? Adipo mice com-pared with ArntF F and Hif1aF F mice , respectively , on an HFD . Importantly , total serum adiponectin , the high– molecular weight HMW form of adiponectin , and the ratio of HMW to total adiponectin were increased in Arnt ? Adipo and Hif1a ? Adipo mice on a 12-week HFD Supplementary Fig. 7B Fig. 6B . HMW adiponectin and ratio of HMW to total adiponectin began to be increased following 6 weeks of HFD before the decrease in body weight Supplementary Fig. 5D . Previous studies showed that overexpression of a constitutively active form of HIF1a initiates adipose tissue fibrosis and insulin resistance 16 . In agreement with this finding , expression of the fibrosis related genes Lox , Col1a1 , Col3a1 , and Loxl1 were decreased in Arnt ? Adipo or Hif1a ? Adipo mice Supplementary Table 1 Supplementary Fig. 7C Fig. 6C . Expression of the inflammation-related genes Tnfa and Pai-1 was downregulated in Arnt ? Adipo and Hif1a ? Adipo mice Supplementary Table 1 Supplemen-tary Fig. 7A Fig. 6A . Macrophage marker F4 80 staining of adipose tissue sections revealed that macrophage infiltra-tion to WAT decreased significantly in Arnt ? Adipo and Hif1a ? Adipo mice . Expression of mRNAs encoding the mac-rophage markers F4 80 and CD68 were also decreased in Arnt ? Adipo mice and Hif1a ? Adipo mice Supplementary Table 1 Supplementary Fig. 8A and B . Because it was reported that the aP2 promoter is expressed in macrophage 17 , the possibility that HIF1 was disrupted in macrophage was investigated by determining Arnt gene disruption in peritoneal macrophage P-Mf from Arnt ? Adipo mice . Loss of ARNT in peritoneal macrophage of Arnt ? Adipo mice was minimal in contrast to much lower ARNT mRNA levels in Arnt ? Adipo mouse adipocytes Fig. 7A . Previous studies demonstrated that SOCS3 mRNA is elevated in WAT of diet-induced obesity DIO mice 18,19 . Further , haploinsufficiency of SOCS3 significantly pro-tected mice against the development of DIO and associ-ated metabolic complications 20 . Consistent with these findings , SOCS3 mRNA was also found to be downreg-ulated in Arnt ? Adipo and Hif1a ? Adipo mice , as revealed by microarray analysis Supplementary Table 1 . Expression of SOCS3 mRNA in Arnt ? Adipo and Hif1a ? Adipo mice was significantly lower than that in ArntF F and Hif1aF F mice , respectively Supplementary Fig. 7D Fig. 6D . Expression of SOCS3 protein was also significantly decreased in Hif1a ? Adipo mice Fig. 6E . Adipocytes and macrophage of stromal vascular fraction SVF-Mf were prepared from WAT of Hif1a ? Adipo and Hif1aF F mice after 12 weeks of HFD . In adipocytes , no significant expression of HIF1a mRNA in Hif1a ? Adipo mice was found . After 12 weeks of HFD , expression of SOCS3 in adipocytes of Hif1a ? Adipo mice was ~80 % decreased compared with that in Hif1aF F mice . Adiponectin expression was upregulated in adipo-cytes of Hif1a ? Adipo mice Fig. 7B . Consistent with data obtained in P-Mf , the expression of HIF1a , SOCS3 , and adi-ponectin adiponectin expression being nearly undetectable in SVF-Mf in SVF-Mf were not significantly different TABLE 1 Metabolic parameters after 12 weeks of HFD Genotype ArntF F Data are means 6 SD . *P , 0.05 . †P , 0.01 compared with controls . between Hif1a ? Adipo and Hif1aF F mice after 12 weeks of HFD Fig. 7C . Previous studies revealed that SOCS3 can inhibit adi-ponectin production via JAK2-STAT3–dependent mecha-nisms in adipocytes 21 . Since inactivation of STAT3 may be involved in the inhibition of adiponectin production by SOCS3 , tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 was assessed in WAT from Hif1aF F and Hif1a ? Adipo mice . Indeed , tyro-sine phosphorylation of STAT3 was significantly induced in parallel with increased adiponectin level in Hif1a ? Adipo mice Fig. 6E . These results suggest that the SOCS3 and adiponectin pathway is involved , in part , in the improvement of HFD-induced insulin resistance in Hif1a ? Adipo mice . DISCUSSION Cellular hypoxia is observed in adipose tissue of obese individuals 22 . However , the role of hypoxia in adipose tissue during obesity and insulin resistance remains un-clear . In the current study , adipocyte-specific disruption of HIF1a or its heterodimerization partner , ARNT , were shown to protect against HFD-induced obesity and insulin resistance . HIF1 signaling may regulate SOCS3 and adi-ponectin , thus providing a mechanistic clue by which HIF1 exacerbates whole-body insulin resistance . These findings indicate a central role for adipocyte HIF1 signaling in the pathogenesis of obesity and insulin resistance . In the obese mouse model , hypoxia occurs specifically in WAT , and the response to adipose hypoxia may lead to insulin resistance 23 . HIF1 , the main mediator of the hypoxia response in adipose tissue , is almost undetectable in lean mice but significantly increased in obese mice re-sulting in induction of the HIF1 target genes Glut1 and Pdk1 2 . Moreover , overexpression of a constitutively-active HIF1a in adipose tissue leads to glucose intolerance and insulin resistance 16 . These studies are consistent with results of the present work showing that ablation of ARNT or HIF1a in adipose tissue improved HFD-induced obesity and insulin resistance . In Arnt ? Adipo and Hif1a ? Adipo mice , adipogenesis-related genes such as Pparg , C ebpa , Cfd , and Glut4 were in-creased and adipocyte size and mass reduced after HFD challenge , consistent with the notion that enhanced adi-pogenesis does not correlate with obesity 24,25 . These results provide in vivo evidence that hypoxia inhibits adi-pogenesis in an HIF1-dependent manner 26 . The reduced adiposity in Arnt ? Adipo and Hif1a ? Adipo mice was inde-pendent of food intake and may be due in part to increased energy expenditure . Arnt ? Adipo and Hif1a ? Adipo mice ex-hibited higher serum total adiponectin levels . Others found that in obese mice , adiponectin treatment increased energy Arnt ? Adipo expenditure and decreased mouse fat mass by upregulating expression of uncoupling protein 2 UCP2 and increasing fatty acid oxidation 27–30 . In addition , decreased vascular endothelial growth factor VEGF mRNA in Arnt ? Adipo and Hif1a ? Adipo mice WAT suggests that lower VEGF as a result of loss of HIF1 may also contribute to the decreased adiposity in Arnt ? Adipo and Hif1a ? Adipo mice . Indeed , VEGF inhibitors were shown to decrease adipose mass following HFD 31 . It has previously been claimed that aP2 expression is induced in activated macrophages 17 . However , in Hif1a ? Adipo mice the knockout efficiency of HIF1a in SVF-Mf was very low—consistent with recent reports showing that the efficiency of Cre recombination in macrophage was much less than that in adipocytes 14,32–34 . Loss of HIF1 in adipose tissue can improve whole-body glucose intolerance after HFD , mainly due to enhanced insulin signaling in WAT , liver , and skeletal muscle . The current study revealed that SOCS3 is regulated by HIF1 in WAT . Inflammatory factors such as tumor necrosis factor-a , interleukin-6 , and lipopolysaccharide also inhibit insulin signaling via upregulation of SOCS3 18,35 . SOCS3 can bind to phosphorylated tyrosine 960 of the insulin receptor 36 and inhibit insulin receptor autophosphorylation 37 , IRS1 phosphorylation , and downstream insulin signaling 35 . SOCS3 deficiency increases insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in adipocytes 19 . Therefore , decreased SOCS3 in Arnt ? Adipo and Hif1a ? Adipo mice may account for the improved insulin signaling in WAT . The increased adipo-nectin expression and secretion was accompanied by a de-crease of SOCS3 and activation of STAT3 in Arnt ? Adipo and Hif1a ? Adipo mice . Adiponectin improves insulin sig-naling in both skeletal muscle and the liver 30 . This can explain the present findings that insulin sensitivity in liver and muscle was improved in Arnt ? Adipo and Hif1a ? Adipo mice compared with ArntF F and Hif1aF F mice . In addition , HMW adiponectin levels and the ratio of HMW to total adiponectin were increased in Arnt ? Adipo and Hif1a ? Adipo mice . Indeed , HMW adiponectin levels , or the ratio of HMW adiponectin to total adiponectin , are more meaningful markers than total adiponectin levels for predicting insulin resistance and the development of metabolic syndrome 38 . Overexpression of SOCS3 in adipose tissue inhibited local insulin action but improved systemic glucose me-tabolism , and adiponectin production was increased after HFD 39 . Whereas these data seem paradoxical given the current results , others reported that SOCS3 is elevated in WAT under the pathological conditions of insulin resis-tance 18,19 and when SOCS3 is overexpressed SOCS3 levels rise far higher than under normal physiological conditions . In the current study , SOCS3 expression was decreased in Arnt ? Adipo and Hif1a ? Adipo mice after HFD . Differences in the model and experimental conditions may account for these different observations . In addition , con-sistent with the present results , a recent study showed that pioglitazone exerts its effect to improve whole-body insulin sensitivity through the suppression of SOCS3 , which is associated with an increase in STAT3 phosphorylation and adiponectin production in WAT 21 . Moreover , Arnt ? Adipo and Hif1a ? Adipo mice also have reduced serum triglycerides and FFAs , which is consistent with studies showing that FFAs and triglycerides impair insulin signaling and induce insulin resistance mainly in liver and muscle 40,41 . It is also of interest that the proinflammatory factors tumor necrosis factor-a and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 were decreased in Arnt ? Adipo and Hif1a ? Adipo mice . These factors are also associated with improved insulin sensi-tivity of the whole body in Arnt ? Adipo and Hif1a ? Adipo mice after HFD . In conclusion , the current study clearly shows that HIF1 in adipose tissue plays an important role in the metabolism of lipid and glucose . The HIF1 effects on in-sulin sensitivity may be due in part to its direct or indirect regulation of SOCS3 in WAT , whereas the mechanism of its effect on adiposity and obesity is still not clear and requires further investigation . Because loss of HIF1 ac-tivity improves metabolic function , compounds that in-hibit HIF1 function in adipose tissue might have significant therapeutic potential in reducing obesity and insulin re-sistance .

21885868	RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS—Insulin resistant ob ob PIn atients with type 2 diabetes produce insulin , but insulin signaling of cells and , hence , glucose dis-posal is attenuated , leading to insulin resistance . obesity , metabolic tissue promotes the infil-tration and activation of macrophages that have a proin-flammatory phenotype . In contrast , macrophages present in lean tissue are phagocytic and function in tissue re-modeling 1 . Nuclear factor-kB NF-kB is an important pathway in activation of this proinflammatory state , and ablation of this signaling pathway in myeloid cells in mice prevents diet-and genetic-induced insulin resistance 2 . Studies on obese mice indicate that where calories are re-stricted after development of insulin resistance , macrophages switch to a less activated or alternate activated state 3 . These findings confirm that the activation state of meta-bolic tissue-infiltrating macrophages is plastic and ame-nable to modulation . The most promising treatments for type 2 diabetes are drugs that not only improve insulin signaling but also promote alternate macrophage activation , for example , thiazolidinediones , which are agonists of fatty acid sensors 4 . However , these and other drugs do not cure type 2 di-abetes , have unwanted side effects , and over time , patients may require increasing doses of insulin to regulate in-creasing blood glucose levels 5 . Developing new drugs or approaches to promote alternate activation of macrophages represents a promising approach to treating diabetes . Studies on genetically obese ob ob mice and obese mice consuming a high-fat diet have shown that oral curcumin inhibits macrophage infiltration of adipose tissue and NF-kB activation in the liver increases the production of the adipokine adiponectin in adipose tissue and ameliorates inflammation , hyperglycemia , and insulin resistance 6 . Although pharmacologically safe , curcumin has poor bio-availability after oral administration 7 . Liposomal delivery systems have been used to enhance the bioavailability and improve the delivery of curcumin 8 . As a result of the high hydrophobicity of curcumin , these curcumin-containing lipo-somes curcusomes are stable when diluted and incubated in vitro or injected in vivo 9,10 . We have shown that cur-cusomes are taken up by splenic and lymph node antigen-presenting cells , including macrophages , dendritic cells DCs , and B cells in vivo block NF-kB activity in these cells and inhibit inflammatory disease in mouse models of antigen-induced arthritis 10 . Given the capacity of curcusomes to target and block inflammatory activity of phagocytic antigen-presenting cells , we tested their effects in the ob ob mouse model of obesity and hepatic and peripheral insulin resistance . The data indicate that tumor necrosis factor inducible nitric oxide synthase TNF iNOS -producing DCs Tip-DCs in ob ob livers are inhibited and modulated by curcusomes , resulting in improvements in peripheral insulin resistance . RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Analysis of adipose tissue macrophages . To isolate stromal vesicular Preparation of tissue lysates and immunoblotting . Overnight-fasted mice Statistical analysis . One-way ANOVA analysis with Bonferroni multiple comparison posttest compared multiple means . Significance is indicated as *P , 0.05 , **P , 0.005 , and ***P , 0.001 . All error bars represent SEM . RESULTS The liver of ob ob mice is enriched in Tip-DCs . To determine the extent of inflammation in the livers of obese mice , we first examined proinflammatory cytokine ex-pression by qPCR of RNA isolated from livers of 12-week-old ob ob mice and age-matched ob wt NOB livers . Expres-sion of typical macrophage proinflammatory genes , in-cluding TNF 15-fold and IL-6 3-fold , was increased in obese relative to NOB mice Fig. 1A . The T-cell cytokines IFN-g 5-fold and IL-17 3-fold were also increased in obese livers . There were no differences in the percentages of CD3+ T cells , CD19+ B cells , and pDCA1+ plasmacytoid DCs when comparing ob ob and NOB mice . However , con-sistent with liver inflammation , a reduction in the proportion of CD3+NK1.1 NKT cells and an increase in proportion of MHC class II+ CD11b+ F4 80+ macrophages was observed in livers from ob ob mice compared with age-matched NOB mice Fig. 1B . These cells also expressed CD11c , which is broadly expressed by murine DC populations . We used CD11c immunoselection to isolate and further character-ize this cell population from the liver . In particular , given their inflammatory environment , we sought other markers of DCs described recently to develop from inflammatory monocytes in response to infection in the liver and spleen , known as Tip-DCs because of their expression of TNF and iNOS 13 . After isolation from the liver of ob ob mice , the CD11c+ cells expressed higher levels of iNOS and TNF compared with NOB controls , without or with LPS and IFN-g stim-ulation Fig. 1C . The majority of CD11c+ cells purified from ob ob mice livers expressed CD11b and F4 80 , low levels of MHC class II and CD40 , and intermediate CD80 and CD86 Fig. 1D . After 48-h culture in medium , CD40 , CD80 , CD86 , and MHC class II were upregulated Fig. 1E . Activation with the toll-like receptor TLR agonist LPS had no additional effects on costimulatory molecule upregula-tion data not shown . To examine the distribution of CD11c+F4 80+ cells within ob ob livers , immunofluorescent staining of liver sections from ob ob mice was performed . Large fat bodies surrounded by F4 80+CD11c+ cells were observed in liver sections from the ob ob mice but not from NOB mice , a characteristic pattern observed with liver steatosis Fig. 1F . Consistent with the increased TNF mRNA expression , strong nuclear staining of p65 RelA was observed in CD11c+F480+ inflammatory macrophages surrounding fat deposits , whereas p65 RelA staining was predominantly cytoplas-mic in liver sections from NOB mice Fig. 1F . These data indicate that the fatty liver of ob ob mice is enriched in typical CD11c+ Tip-DCs , expressing cos-timulatory molecules , high levels of p65 RelA nuclear staining , and TNF iNOS . This phenotype indicates their ca-pacity to promote inflammation associated with fatty in-filtration and insulin resistance and is a potential target for therapeutics that inhibit NF-kB . Curcusomes suppress NF-kB pathways and proin-flammatory cytokine production in peritoneal macro - phages . Curcusomes target and inhibit proinflammatory pathways of phagocytic antigen-presenting cells , including macrophages and DCs in healthy mice or mice with in-flammatory arthritis 10 . To test whether curcusomes in-hibited inflammatory function of macrophages in the setting of obesity , peritoneal macrophages were isolated from ob ob mice and cultured with either curcusomes or empty lipo-somes in the presence or absence of opsonized zymosan to induce an oxidative burst . In vitro , curcusomes—but not empty liposomes—inhibited the oxidative burst , indicating an antioxidant effect Fig. 2A . Next , their effect on proin-flammatory cytokine production was examined in macro-phages cultured with LPS for 6 h in the presence or absence of curcusomes and free curcumin Fig. 2B . Consistent with an anti-inflammatory effect , curcusomes or soluble curcumin inhibited LPS-induced IL-6 production in supernatants from macrophage cultures . These data indicate that curcusomes inhibit the oxidative burst and production of proinflamma-tory cytokines by macrophages in response to inflammatory triggers in vitro . Next , in vivo uptake and effects of curcusomes on peri-toneal macrophages were tested by injecting DiI-labeled curcusomes intraperitoneally into ob ob mice . In the peri-toneal cavity , curcusomes were taken up by macrophages and B cells Fig. 2C . Stimulation with LPS indicated that F4 80+ macrophages were the main producers of IL-6 , and this LPS-induced IL-6 could be inhibited by including cur-cumin in the liposome formulations Fig. 2D . Curcusomes reduced the level of LPS-induced nuclear p65 RelA as as-sessed by immunofluorescence microscopy and p65 RelA DNA binding activity by ELISA Fig. 2E and F . These data indicate that curcusomes target macrophages in vitro and in vivo and inhibit LPS-induced NF-kB and proinflammatory cytokine production . Curcusome therapy suppresses NF-kB and proinflam-matory cytokine production by Tip-DCs . To determine whether curcusomes also inhibited liver inflammatory Tip-DCs after intraperitoneal injection into ob ob mice , we an-alyzed liver cells for uptake of DiI-curcusomes . Maximal curcusome uptake was observed at 72 h , where 30 % of CD11c+F4 80+ cells were DiI+ Fig. 3A . This was inde-pendent of liver steatosis , since NOB mice showed similar uptake of curcusomes . Immunofluorescent staining of liver sections from ob ob mice injected with curcusomes 72 h earlier confirmed that Tip-DCs surrounding hepatocytes are the predominant cell type taking up liposomes Fig. 3B . Consistent with nuclear staining of Tip-DCs for p65 RelA , the constitutive p65 RelA DNA binding detected in nuclear extracts of Tip-DCs isolated from livers of ob ob mice was further inducible after 1-h culture with LPS Fig. 3C . In contrast to ob ob mice , p65 RelA DNA binding in nuclear extracts from Tip-DCs isolated from livers of ob ob mice treated with curcusomes was reduced and failed to increase in response to LPS signaling Fig. 3C . To characterize the impact of curcusome delivery on Tip-DC function , we assessed cytokine expression in Tip-DCs by qPCR . Tip-DCs isolated from ob ob mice expressed lower levels of IL-4 compared with untreated ob ob mice Fig. 3D . Moreover , curcusomes enhanced IL-4 mRNA expression by Tip-DCs , an effect not seen with empty liposomes . The other major impact of curcusome delivery was reduced expression of TNF and IL-6 mRNA compared with untreated ob ob mice at 72 h Fig. 3E . No changes in the proportion of CD11c+ DCs , CD11c+F480+ Tip-DCs , F480+ macrophages , plasmacytoid DCs , and NKT cells were observed 72 h after curcusome injection Supplementary Fig. 1 . The data indicate that inflammatory Tip-DCs in the liver are targets in vivo of intraperitoneal injection of curcusomes . The result is a reduction in NF-kB DNA binding , enhanced IL-4 , and reduced TNF and IL-6 . Curcusome therapy improves insulin resistance in ob ob mice . Compared with NOB mice , ob ob mice have increased fasting glucose and insulin , leading to a higher HOMA-IR Fig. 4A–C . Treatment of ob ob mice with curcusomes for 72 h reduced fasting glucose , insulin , and HOMA-IR to levels observed in NOB mice Fig. 4C . GTTs confirmed that insulin resistance was improved after curcusome treatment , with a significant improvement in glucose uptake after glucose challenge Fig. 4D . The improvement in HOMA-IR with curcusomes correlated with an increase in serum levels of the insulin-sensitizing adipokine adiponectin Fig. 4E . The increase in adiponectin indicated that adipose tissue function was affected by curcusome delivery . To determine if insulin sensitization was improved longer term after curcusome treatment , ob ob mice were injected with a single dose of curcusomes and HOMA-IR assessed after 4 weeks . Compared with age-matched nontreated controls , ob ob mice treated with curcusomes showed re-duced HOMA-IR Fig. 4F . To assess tissue-specific effects on insulin signaling after curcusome treatment , fasted ob ob mice , treated or un-treated with curcusomes , were injected with insulin and pAKT levels were determined in the liver and skeletal tis-sue . Increased levels of insulin-induced pAKT were ob-served in the liver and skeletal muscle of ob ob mice treated with curcusomes , indicating systemic improvements in in-sulin signaling after curcusome treatment Fig. 5 . Given that curcusomes are widely taken up and inhibitory of inflammatory macrophages and DCs in ob ob tissues , we also examined their uptake and effects on ATMs . We injec-ted curcusomes and examined uptake by ATMs at 24 and 72 h by flow cytometry Fig. 6A . Of ATMs , 35 % were DiI+ and DiI uptake was maximal at 72 h , similar to the levels of uptake seen in the liver . Moreover , the cells that took up curcusomes were CD11b+F4 80+CD11c+ macrophages similar to liver Tip-DCs and were similarly located in “crown-like” structures surrounding large fat-laden adipo-cytes Fig. 6B . Isolated adipose tissue inflammatory DCs demonstrated nuclear staining for p65 RelA and p50 but cytoplasmic staining for c-Rel , p52 , and RelB , indicating activation of the classical but not alternate NF-kB pathway Supplementary Fig. 2 . Nuclear p65 RelA staining was reduced in ATMs isolated from adipose tissue of ob ob mice treated with curcusomes for 72 h Fig. 6C . Since both hepatic Tip-DCs and inflammatory ATMs are targeted by curcusomes , we determined which cell type promotes insulin resistance by isolating hepatic Tip-DCs and ATMs from ob ob mice and adoptively transferring each population to NOB mice . At 72 h later , we analyzed the metabolic effect with a GTT in fasting mice . Transfer of hepatic Tip-DCs or ATMs impaired GTT in NOB recipients . In contrast , the same cells isolated from curcusome-treated ob ob mice showed no impairment of GTT Fig. 6D . These results indicate that both hepatic Tip-DCs and ATMs promote insulin resistance and that suppression of either hepatic Tip-DC or ATM function with curcusomes is sufficient to prevent insulin resistance in obese mice . FIG. 5 . Improved insulin signaling in tissues isolated from ob ob mice treated with curcusomes . Lysates of quadriceps and liver from curcusome-treated or untreated ob ob mice signaled with I or without S insulin were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted for pAKT ser473 and AKT . Induction of pAKT in NOB mice after insulin in-jection was used as a positive control for the experiment . DISCUSSION The majority of obesity-related problems , such as type 2 diabetes , have been shown to stem from a low-grade proinflammatory state 14 . Increased activation of proinflammatory signaling pathways such as NF-kB and an associated increase in production of proinflammatory molecules from macrophages have been implicated in obesity-related pathophysiological states 15 . ATMs are of particular interest because they accumulate with weight gain and produce TNF and IL-6 , which promote insulin resistance 16 . ATMs are heterogeneous , including both CD11c+ and CD11c2 phenotypes . However , the CD11b+F4 80+CD11c+ population is increased in obesity and has a proinflammatory phenotype 1 . Moreover , in ob ob mice reconstituted with bone marrow from CD11c-diphtheria toxin receptor transgenic mice , ablation of CD11c+ ATMs with diphtheria toxin prevents insulin resistance 17 . These findings indicate that targeting CD11c+ ATMs is likely to be beneficial in treating type 2 diabetes . In addition to ATMs , hepatic macrophages also contribute to insulin resistance by release of systemic inflammatory mediators , as shown by studies where depletion of Kuppfer cells using liposomes containing chlodronate prevented the development of in-sulin resistance 18 . Obese mice fed a high-fat diet were able to normalize skeletal muscle and adipose tissue insulin sensitivity , but not hepatic insulin sensitivity , after dietary normalization , indicating a dissociation of hepatic steatosis from insulin resistance 3 . It is intriguing that this reversal does not seem to correlate with a reduction of CD11c+ ATM num-bers but rather , a reversal of their proinflammatory state , indicating that ATMs have the potential to be inhibited in response to appropriate cell signals or tissue factors 3 . These studies indicate that even with dietary intervention , it may also be essential to target hepatic inflammatory macrophages for treatment of insulin resistance . The polyphenol curcumin is considered the most ac-tive component in Curcuma longa or turmeric , a pop-ular dietary spice used in Southeast Asian countries 19 . Curcumin inhibits the activation of NF-kB and TLR-4 proin-flammatory signaling pathways in mouse models and does so without any dose-limiting toxicities 20–23 . Moreover , curcumin supplementation by gavage in SD rats injected with streptozotocin reversed diabetic markers , such as blood levels of IL-6 , MCP-1 , TNF , glucose , glycosylated hemoglobin , and oxidative stress 24 , indicating that curcumin supple-mentation can reduce hyperglycemia and the risk of vascular inflammation in diabetes . However , the bioavailability of oral curcumin is low , and other modes of delivery will be required to exploit its therapeutic properties 7 . Liposomes , wherein curcumin is encapsulated in a lipid bilayer , have been shown to be an effective curcumin delivery method in different disease settings in vivo 8 . In this study , ob ob mice were used to explore whether curcusomes could be delivered to inflammatory macrophages and whether this inhibited NF-kB signaling and proinflammatory cytokine production . Curcusomes inhibited the zymosan-induced oxidative burst , in peritoneal macrophages , and NF-kB–induced IL-6 pro-duction by liver Tip-DCs and ATMs isolated from ob ob mice , and both these populations were able to transfer in-sulin resistance to NOB mice unless inhibited by curcusomes . Thus , encapsulation into liposomes overcomes the bio-availability problems of curcumin and effectively targets curcumin to the phagocytic inflammatory antigen-presenting cells that mediate insulin resistance in obese mice . It is surprising that we identified a population of TNF-and iNOS-expressing DCs in the liver of ob ob mice . These macrophages share similarities to recently described in-flammatory liver DCs or Tip-DCs that play an important role in pathogen clearance . Tip-DCs develop from bone marrow–derived CD11b+Ly6C+ inflammatory monocytes , which differentiate into CD11c+ and CD80 CD86 MHC-II low immature inflammatory DCs in the liver , by a CCR2-dependent process 13 . In response to pathogen and IFN-g , Tip-DCs can differentiate to TNF+ , iNOS+ , and CD80 CD86 MHC-II high mature inflammatory DCs that lead to liver damage that is preventable with IL-10 13 . The increase of this population in ob ob mice and their proximity to fat-laden hepatocytes suggest that activated hepatocytes in the steatotic liver secrete chemokines that induce recruitment and development of Tip-DCs , in synergy with alternate TLR-4 damage–associated ligands , such as free fatty acids , and with T-cell–derived IFN-g . Since hepatic Tip-DCs could be further activated to express in-creased amounts of TNF and iNOS by ex vivo culture , they may not be fully activated in the obese environment . This is significant , in light of the sensitivity of ob ob mice to endotoxin-associated liver damage , which might also be preventable with curcusomes 25 . Tip-DCs may also be relevant to human liver disease , where 15 % of all patients with non–alcohol-related fatty liver disease and associated steatosis develop steatohepatitis , characterized by hepato-cellular injury , inflammation , and fibrosis 26 . These patients develop liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma at in-creased rates . Inhibition of Tip-DC–dependent inflammation may occur through a number of mechanisms . In this study , we show that curcusomes are taken up by Tip-DCs after intraperito-neal injection and that Tip-DCs show impaired induction of nuclear RelA , reduced production of TNF and IL-6 , and in-creased IL-4 . This correlated with improvements in insulin resistance , both in the short-term and over a longer 4-week experiment . It is important that IL-4 has been shown to in-duce an alternative activated signature in liver macrophages in a peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor-d depen-dent process . On the other hand , ATMs require peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor-g for alternate activation 27,28 . Thus , curcusomes may not only reduce macrophage inflammation through direct effects on NF-kB but also fur-ther induce alternate macrophage pathways indirectly , through IL-4 . In this study , curcusome therapy had minimal impact on proportions of Tip-DCs and other leukocytes within the liver , indicating that the insulin-sensitizing effects of curcusomes were not due to death or alterations in recruit-ment of inflammatory cells to the liver , at least during the 72 h after treatment . Moreover , a single dose of curcusomes imparted longer term improvements in insulin signaling for at least 4 weeks . The longer term benefits are likely to relate to specific targeting and or the long-lived properties of macrophages . Curcusomes targeted hepatic macrophages , which improved insulin signaling as measured by insulin-induced pAKT in the liver . Insulin signaling was also im-proved in the muscle , indicating improvements in systemic insulin resistance . Liver sensitivity to obesity and endotoxin may also be regulated by numbers of and cytokine production by NKT cells or regulatory T cells in the liver . NKT cells recognize CD1d , which is expressed by CD11c+ DCs 29,30 . NKT cells may secrete cytokines such as IL-10 and IL-4 that could suppress Tip-DC function 31,32 . In this regard , ob ob mice have reduced numbers of NKT cells in the liver , and transfer of NKT cells has been shown to improve insulin sensitivity 33,34 . The mechanism behind improvements is likely through suppression of hepatic Tip-DC and ATM activation . Although we also observed reduced numbers of NKT cells in the livers of ob ob mice , curcusome injection did not in-crease numbers of hepatic NKT cells . However , we can not rule out the possibility that lipid components in combina-tion with curcumin may promote cytokines from existing NKT cells that suppress Tip-DCs . Adipose tissue regulatory T cells may also provide a source of IL-10 , since obesity correlates with a reduction in regulatory T cells in visceral adipose tissue and expansion of regulatory T-cell number with oral anti-CD3 , or by adoptive transfer prevents onset of insulin resistance 35,36 . Further work is needed to deter-mine whether curcusomes suppress inflammation-induced insulin resistance through these regulatory networks , par-ticularly in light of our previous work demonstrating that curcusomes inhibit inflammatory arthritis through induction of regulatory T cells . In conclusion , curcusome nanopar-ticles inhibit proinflammatory pathways in hepatic Tip-DCs and ATMs and reverse insulin resistance . Targeting inflam-matory DCs is a promising approach for type 2 diabetes prevention and treatment .

21911754	RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS—Diabetes in mice was 60 2985–2994 , 2011 Cter ardiovascular complications are the leading cause of diabetes-related morbidity and mortality 1 . Diabetes not only exacerbates cardiac injury af-myocardial infarction or ischemia reperfusion 2–4 but also directly damages the heart , leading to a unique diabetic cardiomyopathy independent of coronary artery disease , hypertension , and hyperlipidemia 1,5 . Di-abetes is characterized by hyperglycemia . The correlation between hyperglycemia and cardiomyopathic changes such as cardiac hypertrophy , interstitial fibrosis , and apoptosis of cardiomyocytes is long established 6 . However , the un-derlying cellular mechanisms responsible for these abnor-malities remain partially understood . Calpains are Ca2+-dependent intracellular proteases . Two of the best characterized calpain species are m-calpain calpain-1 and m-calpain calpain-2 . These isoforms are heterodimers consisting of 80 kDa catalytic subunits encoded by the Capn1 and Capn2 genes , respectively and a 30 kDa regulatory subunit encoded by Capn4 7–9 . The regulatory subunit is essential for m-and m-calpain stability and catalytic activity . Knockout of Capn4 in mice abolished calpain-1 and calpain-2 activity , resulting in em-bryonic lethality 10 . Calpain-1 and calpain-2 activities are tightly controlled by the endogenous inhibitor calpastatin . Calpastatin appears to be specific for these two calpain isoforms but does not inhibit any other protease 7 . Over-expression of calpastatin has been successfully used to block calpain activation both in vitro and in vivo 11–14 . Although its precise physiological function is uncertain , calpain plays a demonstrated role in cardiovascular disease 14,15 . Studies have shown promising improvements in car-diac function after inhibition of calpain activity whether in infarction or ischemia reperfusion models 14–17 . We have recently demonstrated that calpain activity increases in high glucose–treated cardiomyocytes and in short-term streptozotocin STZ -induced diabetes 14 . Pharmacological inhibition of calpain reduced apoptosis in both treatments . Furthermore , research has uncovered vital roles for calpain in regulating the activity of nuclear factor of activated T cells NFAT and nuclear factor-kB NF-kB , two tran-scription factors frequently implicated in the promotion of hypertrophy and fibrosis 18–21 . Therefore , we hypothe-sized that inhibition of calpain may have a protective effect on the myocardium in diabetes . To our knowledge , no study has previously examined the role of calpain in cardiac hy-pertrophy and fibrosis in diabetic conditions . Here we show that cardiomyocyte-specific calpain deletion or calpastatin overexpression reduces cardiomyopathy in mouse models of type 1 diabetes . RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS In vivo left ventricular pressure–volume measurements . Mice were RESULTS Calpain activities are increased in diabetic hearts . To establish calpain as a protease of interest in understanding the mechanisms behind cardiomyopathy in the diabetic heart , we measured calpain activity in heart tissues from STZ-injected and OVE26 diabetic mice . Consistent with our recent report in short-term STZ-induced diabetes 14 , both STZ and OVE26 hearts showed a significant increase in calpain activity over nondiabetic hearts Fig. 1A and B . The activation of calpain was further confirmed by up-regulation of cleaved a-spectrin in diabetic hearts Fig. 1C . The upregulation of calpain activity was not as a result of alterations in the ratio of calpain to calpastatin expres-sion because the protein and mRNA levels of calpain-1 and calpain-2 as well as calpastatin were not significantly altered in diabetic hearts Fig. 1D and Supplementary Fig. 1 . These results confirm the association between in-creased calpain activity and diabetes . Generation of cardiac-specific Capn4 knockout mice . To investigate the role of calpain , we generated mice with cardiomyocyte-specific disruption of calpain by crossing floxed Capn4PZ mice with transgenic mice overexpressing Cre under the control of the a-MHC promoter Tg-Cre . All of the mice used in this study , including controls , were littermates of the same generation . PCR analysis of tail DNA confirmed untargeted Capn4+ + , either homozygous Capn4PZ PZ or heterozygous Capn4+ PZ for the floxed Capn4 gene , and the Cre transgene Supplementary Fig. 2A . Mice homozygous or heterozygous for the floxed Capn4 gene and positive for the a-MHC-Cre transgene were iden-tified as potential homozygous Capn42 2 or heterozygous knockouts Capn4+ 2 , respectively . To confirm decreased Capn4 expression in the heart , Capn4 mRNA was analyzed in Capn4+ + and Capn42 2 mice using primers specifically amplifying the deleted region of Capn4 mRNA . Myocardial Capn4 mRNA was reduced by 78 % in Capn42 2 mice , as compared with Capn4+ + mice Fig. 2A and B . In contrast , Capn4 mRNA levels in lung tissues were similar between Capn42 2 and Capn4+ + mice Fig. 2A and B , supporting cardiac-specific Capn4 knockout . To further confirm that the deletion of Capn4 was restricted in cardiomyocytes , the mRNA levels of Capn4 were significantly decreased in isolated cardiomyocytes of Capn42 2 mice , whereas their levels were comparable between Capn42 2 and Capn4+ + fibroblasts Fig. 2C . Because the Capn4-encoded regula-tory subunit is required for the stability and proteolytic activities of calpain-1 and calpain-2 catalytic subunits 10 , Capn4 deletion results in the disruption of calpain-1 and calpain-2 activities . Indeed , casein zymography analysis of myocardial tissues showed a robust reduction of both calpain-1 and calpain-2 activities in Capn42 2 compared with Capn4+ + mice Fig. 2D , confirming the functional knockout of Capn4 . Similar to Capn4 mRNA expression , both calpain-1 and calpain-2 activities were not decreased in Capn42 2 lung tissues Fig. 2D . Capn42 2 mice grew normally into adulthood with no obvious health problems . In nondiabetic mice , there were no differences in heart weight , body weight , and in Capn4+ + or Capn42 2 mice Supplementary Table 1 . Glucose tolerance test showed no difference between Capn4+ + and Capn42 2 Supplementary Fig. 2B . Histological analysis showed no pathological changes in Capn42 2 hearts Supplementary Fig. 2C . These observations suggest that cardiomyocyte-specific deletion of Capn4 is not deleterious to the heart and rules out potential adverse effects of Cre expression in the hearts of Capn42 2 mice . Disruption of calpain reduces myocardial hypertro-phy in mouse models of type 1 diabetes . Capn42 2 and Capn4+ + mice were rendered diabetic with STZ . Two months after STZ injection , mice exhibited hyperglycemia , hyperphagia , polydipsia , and decreased body weight ver-sus vehicle-treated animals . There were no evident differ-ences in body weight , heart weight , and blood glucose concentration between Capn42 2 and Capn4+ + diabetic mice Supplementary Table 1 . Consistent with our recent report 25 , histological analysis of cardiomyocyte cross-sectional areas in wild-type mice revealed increased cardiomyocyte size in diabetic versus nondiabetic hearts , indicative of cardiomyocyte hypertrophy . However , car-diomyocyte sizes were not increased in diabetic Capn42 2 hearts Fig. 3A . Furthermore , gene expression measure-ments of diabetic hearts showed upregulation of both ANP and b-MHC mRNA Fig. 3B and C , providing further evi-dence of a hypertrophic phenotype . Although both genes were also upregulated in Capn42 2 diabetic hearts , those increases were significantly reduced relative to wild-type mice Fig. 3B and C . Interestingly , there were no differences in cardiomyocyte size and hypertrophic gene expression when comparing Capn42 2 and Capn4+ + nondiabetic hearts Fig. 3B and C . These results demonstrated that Capn4 knockout prevents myocardial hypertrophy in a mouse model of STZ-induced type 1 diabetes . Deletion of Capn4 also decreased myocardial caspase-3 activity Fig. 3D and cytoplasmic histone-associated DNA fragments Supple-mentary Fig. 3 , suggesting a reduction of apoptosis , which is consistent with our recent report 14 . Similarly , 5 months after STZ injection , cardiomyocyte size and hypertrophic gene expression were reduced in Capn42 2 compared with Capn4+ + hearts Supplementary Fig. 4A and B , suggesting that the protective effects of Capn4 deletion may be sus-tained in diabetic cardiomyopathy . Calpain-1 and calpain-2 activities are tightly and specifically regulated by calpastatin 8 . Overexpression of calpastatin has been successfully used to block calpain activation both in vitro and in vivo 11–14 . To further understand the role of calpain in diabetic cardiac hypertrophy , we rendered transgenic calpastatin mice Tg-CAST and their wild-type littermates diabetic by STZ treatment and assessed cardiac hypertrophic changes 2 months after STZ injection . In non-diabetic mice , there were no differences in cardiomyocyte sizes and hypertrophic gene expression in hearts of Tg-CAST and wild-type mice Fig. 3E–G . In diabetic mice , overexpression of calpastatin did not correlate with altered blood glucose levels and body and heart weight Supple-mentary Table 1 however , diabetes-induced increases in cardiomyocyte cross-sectional areas , ANP and b-MHC expression , and caspase-3 activity were significantly attenu-ated in Tg-CAST compared with wild-type mice Fig. 3E–H . These results further argue that inhibition of calpain reduces myocardial hypertrophy in STZ-induced diabetic mice . To rule out the possibility that STZ treatment had systemic actions independent of b-cell destruction , we repeated these experiments in the OVE26 type 1 diabetic mouse model and crossed them with Tg-CAST mice to inhibit calpain activity . Expression of transgenic calpastatin in the OVE26 heart was confirmed by RT-PCR Supplementary Fig. 5A . At the age of 5 months , cardiomyocyte cross-sectional areas , the levels of ANP and b-MHC mRNA , and caspase-3 activity were significantly increased in OVE26 mice compared with their wild-type littermates Fig. 4A–D , indicative of cardiac hypertrophy . There were no differences in blood glucose levels and body and heart weight between OVE26 and Tg-CAST OVE26 mice Supplementary Table 1 however , the increases in cardiomyocyte cross-sectional areas , ANP and b-MHC expression , and caspase-3 in OVE26 hearts were normalized in Tg-CAST OVE26 mice Fig. 4A–D . These results in the OVE26 model further support the antihy-pertrophic effect of calpain inhibition in type 1 diabetes . To explore potential downstream signaling in calpain-mediated myocardial hypertrophy , we focused on two transcription factors , NFAT and NF-kB , which play central roles in the regulation of cardiac hypertrophy 18,29–32 . It is generally accepted that calpain-dependent activation of the serine threonine protein phosphatase calcineurin con-trols NFAT activity in cardiomyocytes 18 . Studies also suggest that calpain mediates degradation of the cytosolic NF-kB inhibitor , inhibitor k Ba IkBa , a step that is a pre-requisite in the activation of NF-kB 33 . In this regard , we measured the activities of both NF-kB and NFAT in OVE26 and Capn42 2 diabetic hearts . When compared with the nondiabetic heart of wild-type or Tg-CAST mice , the ac-tivities of both NF-kB and NFAT were increased in OVE26 and STZ-injected Capn4+ + hearts . However , overexpression of calpastatin in Tg-CAST OVE26 mice and Capn4 de-letion in Capn42 2 STZ mice correlated with significantly lowered NF-kB and NFAT activities relative to OVE26 and FIG. 3 . Assessment of cardiac hypertrophy in diabetic Capn42 2 knockout [ KO ] and Tg-CAST mice . Cardiac hypertrophy was de-termined by measuring cardiomyocyte cross-sectional areas and hypertrophic gene expression ANP and b-MHC . A–D Deficiency of Capn4 reduced cardiomyocyte cross-sectional areas A , the mRNA levels of ANP B and b-MHC C , and caspase-3 activity D in di-abetic Capn42 2 hearts . E–H Cardiomyocyte cross-sectional areas E , the mRNA levels of ANP F and b-MHC G , and caspase-3 activity H were decreased in diabetic Tg-CAST hearts . Data are mean 6 SD n 8 . *P 0.05 vs. sham in wild-type WT # P 0.05 vs. STZ in WT . STZ-injected Capn4+ + hearts Fig. 4E–H . These results suggest that the calpain calpastatin system may be involved in the activation of NF-kB and NFAT pathways in the com-plex regulation of cardiac hypertrophy in diabetic hearts . Calpain is required for myocardial fibrosis in mouse models of type 1 diabetes . Myocardial fibrosis is com - monly observed in diabetic cardiomyopathy and is char-acterized by excessive production and accumulation of extracellular collagen 1,34 . To assess fibrosis , myocardial tissues were stained with picrosirius red to highlight colla-gen . Ratios of collagen area to total area were measured . Deposition of collagen was increased in STZ-induced di-abetic hearts however , Capn4 deletion in Capn42 2 mice and calpastatin overexpression in Tg-CAST mice correlated with a significant reduction in those levels after STZ in-jection Fig. 5A–C . In line with altered collagen deposition , deletion of Capn4 and overexpression of calpastatin low-ered the mRNA levels of collagens I and III in diabetic Capn42 2 and Tg-CAST hearts , respectively Fig. 5E and F and Supplementary Fig. 6A . Similarly , this inhibitory ef-fect of calpain deletion on myocardial fibrosis was also observed 5 months after STZ injection Supplementary Fig. 4C–E . Thus , inhibition or targeted disruption of calpain prevented myocardial fibrosis in the STZ-induced mouse model of type 1 diabetes . MMPs play key roles in maintenance and degradation of the extracellular matrix ECM , contributing to the process FIG. 4 . Assessment of cardiac hypertrophy in OVE26 mice . A–D Car-diomyocyte cross-sectional areas , the mRNA levels of ANP B and b-MHC C , and caspase-3 activity D increased in OVE26 relative to wild-type WT hearts , but were reduced in Tg-CAST OVE26 mice . E–H NFAT and NF-kB activities were increased in OVE26 and STZ-injected WT hearts but were reduced in Tg-CAST OVE26 and Capn4 knockout KO hearts . Data are mean 6 SD n 6–8 . *P 0.05 vs. WT # P 0.05 vs. OVE26 or STZ in WT . of myocardial fibrosis 35 , so we next measured MMP activity in the myocardium . STZ-induced diabetes corre-lated with 34 % elevation in total MMP activity , but this increase was significantly reduced in diabetic Tg-CAST and Capn42 2 mice Fig. 6A and D . Because MMP-2 and MMP-9 are the most important MMPs in the regulation of myocardial remodeling , we measured their activities in the diabetic heart . Similarly , both MMP-2 and MMP-9 activities were reduced in Tg-CAST and Capn42 2 mice Fig. 6B , C , E , and F . The role of MMPs is negatively regulated by tis-sue inhibitors of metalloproteinases TIMPs . We therefore also measured TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 expression in the di-abetic heart . The mRNA levels of TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 were significantly increased in diabetic Capn42 2 compared with Capn+ + mice Fig. 6H and I . Taken together , our data suggest that disruption of calpain may inhibit MMP activi-ties through downregulation of TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 in the diabetic heart . Inflammation plays an important role in myocardial fi-brosis . Our recent study demonstrated that expression of proinflammatory cytokines correlates with myocardial fi-brosis in the diabetic heart 25 . In line with the inhibition of myocardial fibrosis , deletion of Capn4 significantly de-creased TNF-a and TGF-b1 expression in diabetic Capn42 2 compared with Capn4+ + mice Fig. 7A and B . In addition , the number of mast cells was increased in the diabetic heart , which was reduced in Capn42 2 mice Supplementary Fig. 7A and B . OVE26 mice also displayed myocardial fibrosis as de-termined by increases in collagen deposition Fig. 5D , mRNA levels of collagen I and collagen III Fig. 5G and Supplementary Fig. 6B , and elevation of MMP activity Fig. 6G . All these indications of fibrosis were normalized by calpastatin overexpression in Tg-CAST OVE26 mice . These results further argue for the protective effects of calpain inhibition in diabetic hearts in mouse models of type 1 diabetes . To gain further insights into the role of calpain in fi-brosis , we isolated and cultured cardiac fibroblast cells , which are the putative mediators of fibrosis . High glucose 30 mmol L was used to mimic the diabetic condition in cultured fibroblasts . High glucose raised calpain Fig. 7C and MMP activities Fig. 7D as well as cell proliferation relative to normal glucose 5.5 mmol L Fig. 7E and F . These effects were abrogated by calpain inhibitor-III . Con-sistently , fibroblasts from Tg-CAST hearts showed much lower MMP activity and less cell proliferation than those from wild-type hearts in response to high glucose Fig. 7D–F . These effects of calpain inhibition correlated with the changes of NF-kB activation Fig. 7G . Further in vivo evi-dence to support the inhibitory effect of calpain inhibition on fibroblast proliferation in the diabetic heart were that 1 a-smooth muscle actin a-SMA expression was reduced in diabetic Capn42 2 compared with Capn4+ + mice and 2 the number of noncardiomyocytes was relatively less in diabetic Capn42 2 than that in Capn4+ + hearts Supplementary Fig. 7D and E . Thus , inhibition of MMP activity and reduction of fibroblast cell proliferation by calpain inhibition may represent important mechanisms for reducing fibrosis in diabetic hearts . FIG. 6 . MMP activities and TIMP expression in diabetic hearts . MMP activities were determined in Capn42 2 , Tg-CAST , and OVE26 hearts . A MMP activities were increased in diabetic hearts . Overexpression of calpastatin reduced total MMP activities and MMP-2 and MMP-9 ac-tivities in diabetic Tg-CAST hearts A–C . D–F Deficiency of Capn4 reduced total MMP activities and MMP-2 and MMP-9 activities in Capn42 2 knockout [ KO ] relative to nondiabetic wild-type WT hearts . G Total MMP activities were elevated in OVE26 relative to WT hearts and were decreased in Tg-CAST OVE26 hearts . H and I TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 mRNA levels were decreased in Capn42 2 KO relative to nondiabetic WT hearts . Data are mean 6 SD n 6–8 . *P 0.05 vs. WT # P 0.05 vs. STZ-treated WT or OVE26 . Myocardial function in mouse model of STZ-induced type 1 diabetes . Having demonstrated the ability of calpastatin and cardiac Capn4 deletion to reverse cardio-myocyte hypertrophy and fibrosis in the diabetic myo-cardium , we performed in vivo LV pressure–volume measurements and a functional analysis of heart contrac-tion and relaxation using the Langendorff system as an extension of those results . The hemodynamic parameters were shown in Supplementary Tables 2 and 3 . As expected , pressure–volume analysis showed significant decreases in maximal positive and minimal negative first derivatives of LV pressure +dP dtmax and 2dP dtmin and increase in LV stiffness in diabetic hearts . However , these changes of 2dP dtmin and stiffness were relatively attenuated in di-abetic Capn42 2 and Tg-CAST compared with their wild-type littermates Fig. 8A–D . Consistently , the decreases of heart contraction and relaxation were also attenuated in isolated calpastatin transgenic and Capn4 knockout hearts after STZ injection Fig. 8E–H . Taken together , targeted disruption of calpain preserves myocardial function in di-abetic cardiomyopathy of STZ-induced type 1 diabetes . DISCUSSION Although calpain activity is elevated in the diabetic heart 14 , its pathophysiological significance is incompletely un-derstood . In the current study , we generated novel mouse FIG. 7 . Proinflammatory cytokine expression in diabetic Capn4 knock-out hearts . Five months after STZ injection , the mRNA levels of TGF-b1 A and TNF-a B in Capn42 2 knockout KO and Capn4+ + wild-type WT hearts were determined by real-time RT-PCR .

We observed that cardiac-specific deletion of Capn4 and calpastatin overexpression reduced cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis in both STZ-induced and OVE26 type 1 diabetic mice , leading to the improvement of myocardial function . Given the fact that both calpastatin overexpression and Capn4 deletion inhibit only calpain-1 and calpain-2 activity out of the 14 known mammalian isoforms 7 , the current study reveals a pivotal role for these two calpain isoforms in diabetic cardiomyopathy . An important cellular hallmark of diabetic cardiomyopa-thy is cardiac hypertrophy 1,5,36 . In its initial stages , car-diomyocyte enlargement may be an adaptive response intended to improve ventricular performance 37 . However , sustained hypertrophic growth of the myocardium may be associated with pathological LV remodeling 37 . The role of calpain in cardiac hypertrophy is poorly understood . A recent study reported that transgenic overexpression of calpastatin reduced myocardial hypertrophy in a mouse model of angiotensin-II–induced hypertension 38 , sug-gesting that calpain may be a contributing factor to cardiac FIG. 8 . Cardiac function . Tg-CAST , Capn42 2 knockout [ KO ] , and wild-type WT mice were injected with STZ .

By impeding calpain function we observed a clear reversal of cardiac hypertrophy in both STZ-induced and OVE26 type 1 diabetic mice . These data suggest that calpains may play a role in cardiac hypertrophy of diabetic cardiomyopathy . We further showed that calpain activa-tion correlated with increased NFAT and NF-kB activity , each of which mediates prohypertrophic signaling path-ways 18,19,39,40 . Indeed , calpain has been identified as a key activator of the NF-kB pathway leading to myocardial hypertrophy in angiotensin-II–induced hypertension 38 . Thus , the dramatic reduction of NF-kB activity levels in diabetic hearts after Capn4 deletion and calpastatin over-expression underscores the importance of this pathway in diabetic cardiomyopathy 41 . It has been shown that calpain degrades IkB , the inhibitor of NF-kB , which allows NF-kB to translocate freely into the nucleus and transcribe prohypertrophic genes such as b-MHC . We therefore postulate that inhibition of calpain will increase IkB and limit NF-kB nuclear translocation , thereby limiting cardiac hypertrophy in diabetic hearts . Calpain also activates calcineurin , which is another important mediator of cardiac hypertrophy 19,20 . Activated calcineurin dephos-phorylates NFAT , which binds to GATA-4 upon nuclear translocation and further augments the transcriptional re-sponse leading to myocardial hypertrophy 19 . In this regard , we showed that inhibition of calpain reduced NFAT activity in diabetic hearts , suggesting that the calcineurin NFAT pathway is an additional mechanism by which cal-pain mediates cardiac hypertrophy in diabetic cardiomy-opathy . These results contrast with a recent study that demonstrated that the NFAT pathway was not involved in inhibition of myocardial hypertrophy by calpastatin overexpression in angiotensin-II–induced hypertension 38 . The difference between these two studies suggests that cal-pain may mediate cardiac hypertrophy via multiple mecha-nisms depending on the underlying pathological conditions . Fibrosis is another important hallmark of diabetic cardio-myopathy 1,5,36 . It is believed to be a maladaptive re-sponse independent of cellular hypertrophy that is characterized by excess collagen accumulation 1,5,36 . We consistently observed that myocardial collagen deposition was significantly increased in both STZ-induced and OVE26 type 1 diabetic mice . It is noteworthy that both cardiac-specific deletion of Capn4 and overexpression of calpastatin reduced collagen deposition and expression levels of the main components of the ECM , collagens I and III . This finding suggests that cardiomyocyte-expressed calpain may contribute to fibrosis via indirect paracrine or direct mechanisms . However , it is likely that calpain in non-cardiomyocytes may also play an important role in myo-cardial fibrosis in diabetes since Tg-CAST mice displayed a significant reduction in peri vascular fibrosis in response to angiotensin II stimulation when compared with wild-type mice 38 . Additionally , a significant decrease in angiotensin II–induced synthesis and secretion of collagen occurred in vascular smooth muscle cells from Tg-CAST mice com-pared with wild-type mice 38 . Fibroblasts play an important role in fibrosis 42 . Cardiac fibroblasts may differentiate into myofibroblasts , which in-duce fibroblast proliferation . Our recent study has shown an increase in myofibroblast marker a-SMA in diabetic hearts 25 , suggesting a possible differentiation of myofibroblasts . In this regard , we demonstrated a significant reduction of a-SMA expression in diabetic Capn4 knockout hearts . In line with the downregulation of a-SMA expression , the number of noncardiomyocytes was reduced in diabetic Capn42 2 compared with Capn4PZ PZ mice . Furthermore , cultured cardiac fibroblasts undergo significant hyperpla-sia in response to high glucose , and that was reduced by the inhibition of calpain . Fibroblast proliferation is in-duced by a number of factors , including possibly NF-kB . Evidence suggests the IkB–NF-kB complex is influenced by calpain activation , which may contribute to the develop-ment of diabetic cardiomyopathy through the promotion of fibrosis 43,44 . Specifically , NF-kB is required for the in-duction of proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-a , which is also overexpressed in the diabetic heart 25,40 . Proin-flammatory cytokines can further induce expression of cytokines such as TGF-b1 , which is also elevated in the diabetic heart 25 , and is known to be a profibrogenic inducer 45 . Indeed , our data showed that deletion of Capn4 reduced TNF-a and TGF-b1 expression in the di-abetic heart . The profibrogenic effect of these cytokines may also include MMP activation . Derangement of MMP activity alters the balance between synthesis and degrada-tion of the ECM resulting in excessive collagen deposition and reduced structural integrity in the myocardium 35 . Studies have shown upregulation of MMP-9 activity 46 and downregulation of MMP-2 activity in the diabetic heart 47 . Inhibition of MMP activity has been suggested to be cardiac protective in diabetes 48 . In the current study , we dem-onstrated that total MMP activity was increased in both fibroblasts in vitro in response to high glucose and in the diabetic heart in vivo , which in both cases was reversed by calpain inhibition . Specifically , calpain inhibition also re-duced MMP-2 and MMP-9 activities in the diabetic heart . This finding reveals a link between calpain and MMPs in diabetic conditions . Prior work suggests that calpain induces MMP-9 activity in homocysteine-stimulated cardiac microvascular endothelial cells 49 . Taken together with our findings a general role for calpain in the modulating ECM composition in the heart is likely . It is currently unknown whether hematopoietic cells con-tribute to the fibrotic processes in our type 1 diabetes mod-els . The expression of CD68 , a marker of macrophage , was comparable between diabetic Capn42 2 and Capn4PZ PZ hearts Supplementary Fig. 6C , potentially excluding the involvement of macrophage infiltration in the inhibitory effect of Capn4 deletion in diabetic myocardial fibrosis . However , we demonstrated that the number of mast cells was increased in the diabetic heart , which was signifi-cantly reduced in Capn42 2 compared with Capn4PZ PZ mice . Whether this reduction of mast cells plays a role in the inhibitory effect of Capn4 deletion in diabetic myocardial fibrosis is beyond the scope of this study and merits future studies . In summary , the current study has demonstrated that targeted inhibition of calpain is protective against hyper-trophy and fibrosis , two general hallmarks of diabetic cardiomyopathy , and preserves myocardial function in mouse models of type 1 diabetes . These effects of calpain inhibition may be mediated through NFAT - , NF-kB - , and MMP-dependent signaling pathways . Cardiac hypertrophy and deposition of collagen , in particular collagen I and III , were associated with cardiac dysfunction in diabetes 1,5,36 and were all restored by calpain inhibition , thereby supporting the important in vivo functional significance of the calpain calpastatin system in the diabetic heart . Therefore , calpain may be a potential therapeutic target for diabetes heart diseases .

21925604	a r t i c l e Article history Keywords Introduction The hindbrain region of the central nervous system is responsible for coordination of motor control and regulation of autonomic processes such as respiration , heart rate , blood pressure , and arousal Saper , 2000 . The developing hindbrain is subdivided along the rostral–caudal axis into eight rhombomeres r1–r8 which are distinguished by boundaries of gene expression , patterns of cell differentiation , and mor-phology Lumsden and Keynes , 1989 . Rhombomere 1 r1 , located caudal to the midbrain and isthmus and rostral to r2 , is easily distin-guishable morphologically in the mouse brain by E10.5 . Dorsal r1 gives rise to the cerebellum and neurons of the locus coeruleus whereas ventral r1 contributes to the sensory vestibular nuclei , trigeminal and trochlearnuclei , pedunculopontinetegmentalnucleus , parabrachialnu-cleus , Kölliker–Fuse nucleus , dorsal nucleus of the lateral lemniscus and neurons of dorsal raphe Alder et al. , 1996 Aroca et al. , 2006 Chatonnet et al. , 2007 Ding et al. , 2003 Eddison et al. , 2004 Jensen et al. , 2008 Lin et al. , 2001 Machold and Fishell , 2005 Marin and Puelles , 1995 Wingate and Hatten , 1999 . Much attention has been directed toward understanding the molec-ular markers and mechanisms of development of the cerebellum , the most prominent r1 derivative Herrup and Kuemerle , 1997 Wang and Zoghbi , 2001 . The cerebellum is one of the first brain structures to differentiate and one of the last to mature it is estimated to contain as many as 80–85 % of all human neurons and is an important center for many processes critical for life Wang and Zoghbi , 2001 . In contrast , the definition and origins of the neuronal populations in ventral r1 have received relatively little attention . This lack of molecular informa-tion on developing r1 has impeded progress in the characterization of mouse mutants and therapies for individuals with hindbrain defects . Here , we test the hypothesis that Pitx2 , a paired-like homeodo-main transcription factor , specifies distinct GABAergic neurons that derive from ventral r1 , using loss-of-function , conditional , and Cre knock-in alleles . We also present data from analyses of gene expres-sion patterns in embryonic mouse ventral r1 . Our results suggest that PITX2-positive neurons in r1 are GABAergic and can be divided into two unique subpopulations based on expression of unique com-binations of transcription factors , including LHX1 5 , NKX6.1 6.2 , PAX2 , and SOX2 . Both PITX2-positive GABAergic populations occupy specific bilaterally symmetric regions of ventro-medial r1 . The GABAergic identity of these cells is not disrupted by loss of PITX2 . These observations provide a framework for ongoing studies aimed at exploring the functional molecular genetic pathways that regulate r1 neuronal development . Results Pitx2-positive neuronal populations are localized in the forebrain , midbrain , hindbrain , and spinal cord Mucchielli et al. , 1996 Zagoraiou et al. , 2009 . At E11.5 , Pitx2-positive cells were located in ventral r1 which was bordered rostrally by the Otx2-positive midbrain Fig. 1C , D and Fgf8-positive isthmic organizer Fig. 1E , F and caudally by Hoxa2-expressing r2 Fig. 1G–H . Interestingly , at E11.5 most Pitx2-expressing cells were located in r1 , however a few Pitx2-positive cells appeared to localize at the r1 r2 boundary Fig. 1A . By E12.5 , all Pitx2-positive cells were in a single population in mid-r1 Fig. 1K . At this timepoint , r1 continued to be bordered rostrally by the Otx2-positive midbrain and Fgf8-positive isthmic organizer Fig. 1L , M and caudally by the Hoxa2 Gbx2-positive r2 Fig. 1N , O . Adult ventral r1 contains several different cell populations , including trochlear motor neurons , branchiomotor neurons of the trigeminal nu-cleus , locus coeruleus neurons derived from the alar plate , GABAergic neurons of the pedunculopontine nucleus and laterodorsal tegmental nucleus , and the GABAergic , serotonergic , and glutamatergic neurons of the dorsal raphe Aroca et al. , 2006 Fu et al. , 2010 Jensen et al. , 2008 Marin and Puelles , 1995 Martin et al. , 2002 Wang and Morales , 2009 . As an early step toward characterizing the transcriptional pro-files of ventral r1 neurons , we focused on cells expressing the paired-like transcription factor PITX2 , which prior studies suggested were GABAergic interneurons Martin et al. , 2002 . Here , we asked whether some PITX2-positive cells in r1 adopt neurotransmitter fates other than GABAergic , and whether their neurotransmitter identity requires functional PITX2 . Through double immunofluorescence , we found that 100 % ±0 % of E14.5 PITX2-positive cells were positive for GABA and GAD67-GFP Fig. 2B–C ? . Importantly , most GAD67-GFP-positive neurons in r1 were also positive for GABA immunoreactivity Fig. 2D , D ? , confirming that GABA is an accurate marker of GABAergic neurons in this tissue . PITX2-positive cells were negative for VGLUT2 immunofluorescence Fig. 2E , E ? , which likely marks glutamatergic tracts passing through the hindbrain , such as ponto-tegmental afferents Geisler et al. , 2007 . There was no co-localization between PITX2 and 5-HT 5-hydroxytryptamine Fig. 2F , suggesting that r1 PITX2-positive neurons do not contribute to serotonergic cells of the raphe nuclei or locus coeruleus . Interestingly , some serotonin-and PITX2-positive cells intermingle at the ventromedial limits of Pitx2 expression , and these may represent GABAergic neurons that contribute to the raphe nuclei , pedunculopontine nucleus , or laterodorsal tegmental nucleus Fig. 2F Torterolo et al. , 2000 Wang and Morales , 2009 . The close proximity of PITX2-positive cells to the 5-HT-positive population also raises the possibility that these neurons may communicate with each other Jensen et al. , 2008 . To better understand the distribution of developing neurons in the ventral hindbrain , we performed an extensive analysis of gene ex-pression in the E12.5 mouse brain , a period of active neurogenesis Figs. 3 and 4 . The Engrailed homeobox genes En1 2 are expressed in a broad region encompassing the midbrain and anterior hindbrain and are critical for midbrain and dorsal r1 development Sgaier et al. , 2007 Zervas et al. , 2005 . We found that , similar to PITX2-positive cells , many EN1-positive cells in E12.5 ventral r1 were also GABAergic Fig. 3A–C ? . At E12.5 there was no significant co-expression of PITX2 and EN1 in ventral r1 cells Fig. 3D–F ? . These data suggest a mixed population of PITX2-positive and EN1-positive GABAergic neurons . The LIM-homeodomain transcription factors are expressed by many neuronal subtypes throughout the developing central nervous system Hunter and Rhodes , 2005 . Lhx1 and Lhx5 are widely expressed in GABAergic cells throughout the midbrain , r1 , and the de-veloping cerebellum , and are required for normal cerebellar develop-ment Morales and Hatten , 2006 Zhao et al. , 2007 . We sought to determine whether PITX2-positive cells in ventral r1 also express Lhx1 5 using an antibody that marks both LHX1 and LHX5 , but does not distinguish between the two . We found that at E12.5 , 100 % ±0 % of the PITX2-positive cells were also LHX1 5-positive Figs . 3G–I ? and 4Q , whereas LHX1 5-positive cells comprised a much larger population of cells , most of which were negative for PITX2 . In addition , all EN1-positive cells were also positive for LHX1 5 Fig. 3J–L ? and some were also positive for GABA Fig. 3A–C ? , pro-viding evidence that r1 GABAergic neurons express unique and spe-cific combinations of Pitx2 , En1 , and Lhx1 5 . Additionally , many LHX1 5-positive cells were negative for GABA Fig. 3M–O ? . Thus , the LHX1 5-positive population of cells in ventral r1 appears to represent a heterogeneous group of neurons , and combinations of GABA , Pitx2 or En1 expression may be used to define distinct subpopulations within this group . PITX2-positive cells in r1 at E12.5 occupy a region of the neural tube that contains non-mitotic cells that were negative for phospho-histone H3 Fig. 4B . This is consistent with expression of PITX2 in post-mitotic developing neurons of the hypothalamus and midbrain Martin et al. , 2002 . Early developing neurons in r1 can be identified by expression of several different transcription factors . LMX1B is a LIM homeodomain transcription factor involved in initiation and maintenance of the isth-mic organizer and is important for midbrain and hindbrain patterning Jacob et al. , 2009 Matsunaga et al. , 2002 Mishima et al. , 2009 . Lmx1b is expressed in the principal sensory nucleus of the trigeminal nerve , the Kölliker–Fuse nucleus , the dorsal raphe , and the parabrachial nuclei Dai et al. , 2008 Jacob et al. , 2009 Matsunaga et al. , 2002 Prakash et al. , 2009 Zervas et al. , 2005 . LMX1B is also required for the differen-tiation of midbrain dopaminergic neurons and hindbrain serotonergic neurons Ding et al. , 2003 Jacob et al. , 2009 . We observed two groups of LMX1B-positive cells in E12.5 r1 , one medial and one more laterally positioned Fig. 4C . The PITX2-positive neurons were located between these two groups of LMX1B-positive cells Fig. 4C . Islet1 Isl1 is expressed by motor neurons , including the oculomotor and trochlear nuclei that contain cell bodies of the third and fourth cra-nial nerves , respectively Agarwala and Ragsdale , 2002 Prakash et al. , 2009 . In our study , ISL1-positive cells marking the trochlear nucleus were located at the dorsal–ventral axis border of r1 and lateral to PITX2-positive neurons Fig. 4D . The lack of ISL1 co-localization with PITX2 suggests that PITX2-positive cells do not contribute to the r1-derived trochlear nucleus see Fig. 9 . GATA2 , a transcription factor implicated in GABAergic development in both dorsal and ventral midbrain and required for serotonergic neu-ron development in the hindbrain , is highly expressed in a superficial ventral domain of r1 Craven et al. , 2004 . In our studies , this GATA2-positive population was distinct from the PITX2-positive cell population Fig. 4E . PAX7 , a paired-like transcription factor , is widely expressed in ventral r1 , but did not mark PITX2-positive cells Fig. 4F . EVX1 , a tran-scription factor that is highly expressed in spinal cord interneurons , was alsoexpressed in ventralr1cells in a regionadjacent to but distinctfrom PITX2-positive cells Fig. 4G . LBX1 marked a distinct population of neu-rons dorsal to the PITX2-expressing population Fig. 4H . Thus , PITX2-positive neurons are negative for the transcription factors GATA2 , PAX7 , EVX1 , and LBX1 . In addition to Isl1 , we tested whether Pitx2 neurons express other markers of trochlear and parabrachial nuclei . Trochlear nucleus motor neurons in rostral r1 can also be identified by expression of Phox2a and Phox2b Pattyn et al. , 1997 . We determined the expression pat-terns of Phox2a and Phox2b in E12.5 ventral r1 in relation to Pitx2-expressing cells Fig. 4I–L . Analysis of neighboring sections showed no overlap between Phox2a or Phox2b with Pitx2 mRNA , providing further evidence that PITX2-positive cells do not contribute to the trochlear nucleus . Lmx1a encodes a LIM homeodomain transcription factor that is expressed in the parabrachial nucleus and rhombic lip and is necessary for proper cerebellar development Mishima et al. , 2009 Zou et al. , 2009 however , its role in ventral r1 has not been explored . Lmx1a was weakly expressed lateral and dorsal to the LMX1B population of cells in the LHX1 5-positive region Figs . 4I–J and 3H , K . Together , these data suggest that PITX2-positive r1 neu-rons do not express Phox2a , Phox2b , or Lmx1a and thus do not con-tribute to trochlear or parabrachial nuclei . In the caudal hindbrain and spinal cord , NKX6.1 and NKX6.2 are expressed in visceral motor neurons and interneurons where they are required for neural identity Briscoe et al. , 2000 Pattyn et al. , 2003 Sander et al. , 2000 . NKX6.1 is also implicated in serotonergic neuronal specification in r1 Craven et al. , 2004 . NKX6.1 and NKX6.2 were both broadly expressed in ventral r1 and co-localized with some PITX2-positive cells Fig. 4M , N . Quantitative analysis showed that 27.0 % ±3.3 % of PITX2-positive cells were NKX6.1-positive Fig. 4Q . PAX2 , a paired-like homeodomain transcription factor and marker of early midbrain hindbrain Rowitch and McMahon , 1995 , was expressed in ventral r1 in a domain that partially over-lapped with PITX2 positive cells wherein 43.7 % ±7.8 % of PITX2-positive cells were PAX2-positive Fig. 4O . We also observed 61.6 % ±6.8 % overlap between PITX2-positive cells and SOX2 Fig. 4P . Co-expression of some PITX2-positive cells with NKX6.1 , NKX6.2 , and PAX2 is consistent with the idea that PITX2-positive cells may adopt interneuron fates . In the developing spinal cord , PAX2 and NKX6.1 mark separate post-mitotic populations with distinct pro-genitor populations Lebel et al. , 2001 . Similarly , PAX2 and NKX6.1 in ventral r1 mark separate populations Fig. 4R , S , suggest-ing the presence of at least two subpopulations of PITX2-positive cells that arise from separate progenitor populations . In order to identify whether Pitx2 is expressed in progenitor popu-lations , we looked for early Pitx2 expression in r1 at E10.5 . Although Pitx2 is expressed in the E10.5 midbrain , there was no detectable Pitx2 mRNA in r1 at E10.5 data not shown . At E11.5 , PITX2-positive cells were located lateral to the progenitor zone and negative for the transcription factors BHLHB5 , which marks V1 and V2 populations in the spinal cord Liu et al. , 2007 , and SOX2 Fig. 5A , B . Like the E12.5 PITX2-positive population , PITX2-positive E11.5 cells were also positive for LHX1 5 , PAX2 , and NKX6.1 Fig. 5C–E . Again , PAX2 and NKX6.1 marked separate r1 populations with PAX2-positive cells medially bor-dering the NKX6.1-positive population Fig. 5F–F ? , indicating PITX2-positive cells form at least two subpopulations . To determine whether PITX2-positive cells derive from a single progenitor population , we ana-lyzed E11.5 Dbx1Cre R26YFP embryos for PITX2 patterning . In the spinal cord , the Dbx1-lineage marksV0 populationsand waschosenfor analysis because Pax2-positive , En1-negative cells in the spinal cord are known to derive from V0 Dbx1-positive progenitors Lanuza et al. , 2004 , whereas Nkx6.1-expressing cells are more ventral and constitute V2–V3 popula-tions Sander et al. , 2000 . Interestingly , most ventral r1 PITX2-positive cells were also positive for YFP , although there were several cells which were YFP-negative Fig. 5G–G ? , which likely indicates separate progen-itor populations , but may also be due to inefficient Cre recombination Teissier et al. , 2010 . Thus , r1 PITX2-positive cells appear to derive from at least two different ventral r1 progenitor populations that can be divided into subpopulations based on transcription factor ex-pression patterns . Next we asked whether loss of PITX2 affects neuronal distribution or early patterning by analyzing transcription factor expression in E12.5 Pitx2+ -and Pitx2 -- littermate embryos . Loss of Pitx2 did not affect overall distribution of Pitx2-expressing cells Fig. 6A , B as determined by in situ hybridization using a cRNA probe that is expressed from both the wild type and null alleles Martin et al. , 2004 . The increased density of Pitx2 mRNA in null embryos com-pared to controls could signify increased transcription or mRNA sta-bility . Additionally , expression of several transcription factors SOX2 , GATA2 , NKX6.1 , LHX1 5 , EN1 , PAX2 , PAX7 in Pitx2 -- ventral r1 appeared normal as compared to Pitx2+ -littermate Fig. 6 or wild type Fig. 4 embryos . These data suggest that PITX2 is not required for the proper early migration of Pitx2-expressing cells or early pattern-ing of ventral r1 . By E18.5 , most neurons in the hindbrain have undergone initial stages of differentiation and many of the early transcription factors are no longer expressed . To assay Pitx2-lineage neuronal fates , we crossed Pitx2Cre + mice Liu et al. , 2002 Skidmore et al. , 2008 with a ZsGrn Cre reporter strain . Interestingly , at E18.5 PITX2-positive neu-rons comprised two contiguous regions in ventral r1 . Transverse sec-tions revealed a deep PITX2-positive population with larger cell bodies and a more superficial population of smaller cells Fig. 7B . ZsGrn staining showed short neurites in Pitx2Cre + ZsGrn embryos , further suggesting these cells may be interneurons . Analysis of sagit-tal sections of Pitx2Cre + ZsGrn also highlighted the cell localization and size differences between the superficial and deep populations of PITX2-positive cells in ventral r1 Fig. 7D–H . Previous studies in the spinal cord identified a requirement for LHX1 and LHX5 in the maintenance of inhibitory interneuron identity Pillai et al. , 2007 . We observed LHX1 5-positive cells distributed throughout the rostral hindbrain and both PITX2-positive populations in r1 contained many LHX1 5-positive cells Fig. 7I–I ? . Interestingly , the more superficial population of PITX2-positive cells was mostly SOX2-positive , whereas only a few cells in the deep population expressed SOX2 Fig. 7J–J ? . Although PITX2-positive cells appear to constitute two separate r1 populations based on localization and morphology , they are both GABAergic at E18.5 Fig. 7K–K ? . PITX2-lineage E18.5 neurons did not express the transcription factor EN1 Fig. 7L similar to results at E12.5 Fig. 3D–F . Interestingly , neither PITX2-positive r1 population was PAX2-positive at E18.5 , in contrast to E12.5 , when some PITX2-positive cells co-labeled with PAX2 Figs . 4O and 7M . Additionally , PITX2-positive cells were negative for GATA2 , which marks serotonergic neurons in r1 Gavalas et al. , 2003 , andfor cholineacetyltransferase ChAT , an enzyme produced in cholin-ergic populations Fig. 7N , O . A few ChAT-positive cells were observed caudal to Pitx2-positive neurons but appeared to constitute distinct neu-ronal groups , such as the pedunculopontine , parabrachial , and microcel-lular tegmental nuclei Machold and Fishell , 2005 Mizukawa et al. , 1986 . To determine whether loss of Pitx2 affects hindbrain neuronal fate specification , we analyzed E18.5 Nestin-Cre conditional Pitx2-knockout embryos for neurotransmitter identity in r1 . Pitx2-positive cells in Nestin-Cre Pitx2flox + embryos occupied a region that highly expresses Gad1 but not Vglut2 or 5-HT Fig. 8B–D , consistent with GABAergic but not glutamatergic or serotonergic fates . Loss of Pitx2 in Nestin-Cre Pitx2flox tlz embryos did not disrupt Gad1 , Vglut2 , or 5-HT , suggesting that reduced Pitx2 dosage does not alter the GABAergic fate of PITX2-positive hindbrain neurons . Discussion Here we show that PITX2 , a paired-like homeodomain transcription factor , is expressed in GABAergic neurons in the ventral aspect of mouse embryonic r1 . These PITX2-positive GABAergic neurons may comprise a population of inhibitory interneurons , based on their a co-expression with LHX1 5 and PAX2 Pillai et al. , 2007 , b location in ventral r1 , and c lack of co-expression with markers of glutamatergic , serotonergic , noradrenergic , and cholinergic neurons . We also show that subsets of GABAergic PITX2-positive neurons express the transcription factors SOX2 , NKX6.1 , and NKX6.2 at E12.5 . Interestingly , Pitx2 loss of function does not disrupt the production or specification of these GABAergic neurons , suggesting compensatory mechanisms likely exist . A summary of our marker analysis in wild type embryos is depicted in Fig. 9 . PITX2-positive cellsmarka distinct , bilaterally symmetric region of ventromedial r1 containing some cells that also express LHX1 5 , NKX6.1 , NKX6.2 , PAX2 , and SOX2 Fig. 9 . The EN1-positive domain spans this PITX2-positive region but extends further toward the ventri-cle than PITX2-positive cells . LHX1 5-positive cells comprise two separate populations in ventral r1 , a medial population that contains PITX2-positive cells and a separate , more lateral population that is PITX2-negative . Axial level and context determine PITX2-positive neuronal identity PITX2-positive neuronal fate as defined by neurotransmitter phe-notype appears to depend on rostro-caudal and dorso-ventral location along the neural tube . At rostral axial levels in the hypothalamus , PITX2-lineage neurons contribute to the glutamatergic subthalamic nucleus , where it is required for neuronal migration Martin et al. , 2004 . In the midbrain , PITX2-positive superior colliculus GABAergic neurons also require Pitx2 for proper migration and differentiation Martin et al. , 2004 Waite et al. , 2011 . At more caudal levels in the spinal cord , PITX2-positive interneurons of the V0C subclass are cholinergic , whereas those of the V0G class are glutamatergic Zagoraiou et al. , 2009 . These subclasses of PITX2-positive V0 interneurons are unevenly distributed along the rostro-caudal axis of the spinal cord , wherein cho-linergic neurons occupy rostral lumbar levels while glutamatergic neu-rons occupy caudal lumbar areas Zagoraiou et al. , 2009 . The axial dependence of PITX2-positive neuronal identity suggests that neuro-transmitter fate specification is not likely to be determined by PITX2-mediated transcriptional regulation . Previous studies have attempted to relate the dorsal–ventral de-velopmental patterning in spinal cord to hindbrain patterning Lebel et al. , 2007 . Our data suggest that both similarities and differ-ences exist between ventral r1 and spinal cord development . The ob-servation that a subpopulation of PITX2-positive cells in ventral r1 is PAX2 LHX1 5-positive , EN1-negative , and derives from Dbx1-positive progenitors suggests that these cells are homologous to V0 interneu-rons like their PITX2-positive spinal cord counterparts Gray , 2008 Lanuza et al. , 2004 . V0 PITX2-positive cells in r1 and the V0 domain in spinal cord differentiate into several different types of neurons cholinergic and glutamatergic in spinal cord , GABAergic in r1 , sug-gesting that neural progenitors destined to express PITX2 are not nec-essarily pre-specified with respect to neurotransmitter fate but influenced by local factors dependent on axial level . We also show that a subpopulation of PITX2-positive cells was NKX6.1-positive and PAX2 LMX1B-negative , suggesting that some of the PITX2-positive r1 cells might be homologous to a spinal V2 interneuron population Gray , 2008 Lebel et al. , 2007 Sander et al. , 2000 . Thus , PITX2 expres-sion in r1 may be progenitor derived lineage-independent and instead be regulated by planar positioning within the developing hindbrain . Through comparison of the identities of r1 PITX2-positive cells to previously published spinal cord patterning maps , we found differ-ences between cell populations in r1 versus spinal cord . In spinal cord , V2 neurons are GATA2-positive , whereas r1 PITX2-positive V2 neurons based on Nkx6.1-positive and Lmx1b-negative expression similar to spinal V2 interneurons , did not express Gata2 . Because our studies did not include GATA2-lineage tracing , we can not distin-guish between transient and absent expression of GATA2 by r1 PITX2-positive cells . It is also possible that V2 neurons have different molec-ular signatures in r1 and spinal cord , as is true for several of the dorsal populations , the pMNvs , and the V3 populations Gray , 2008 . Alter-natively , previous studies have shown that several D-V populations in r1 may not exist in the developing spinal cord such as the DA4 and DB2 populations , or may exist in developing spinal cord and caudal rhombomeres but not r1 such as the DI2 , DI3 , DI5 , and DI6 and that some populations have unique expression patterns between the hindbrain and spinal cord such as DI1–DI3 , pMN , and V3 popula-tions Gray , 2008 . Transcriptional mechanisms of GABAergic neuronal differentiation Throughout the central nervous system , distinct neuronal popula-tions are distinguished by the complement of transcription factors they express as well as by characteristics such as neurotransmitter fate and unique projection patterns . Here we provide a description of sever-al early r1 transcription factors and their mapping with respect to PITX2-positive populations . There is substantial overlap between PITX2 and LHX1 5 expression in GABAergic neurons , and some PITX2-positive cells also express PAX2 in ventral r1 at E12.5 . PAX2 and LHX1 5 , along with PAX5 and PAX8 , function to regulate formation of spinal cord GABAergic inhibitory interneurons Pillai et al. , 2007 . Fur-ther genetic studies are necessary to identify the factors that regulate formation of PITX2-positive GABAergic inhibitory neurons in r1 . In addition to PAX and LHX genes , several other transcription fac-tor genes have been shown to regulate GABAergic neuronal differen-tiation . Interestingly , mutations of many of these transcription factor genes also disrupt or augment glutamatergic differentiation , al-though findings vary by neuronal population and rostro-caudal axial level Cheng et al. , 2005 Pillai et al. , 2007 . The basic helix-loop-helix bHLH transcription factor Ptf1a is required for proper forma-tion of dorsal spinal cord , cerebellar , and retinal GABAergic inhibitory interneurons and loss of Ptf1a leads to an expansion of spinal cord glutamatergic neurons Glasgow et al. , 2005 . The homeobox gene Lbx1 is also necessary and sufficient for spinal cord GABAergic neu-ronal differentiation Cheng et al. , 2005 , but Lbx1 activity can be mod-ified by the homeobox gene Tlx3 , itself an important regulatory of GABAergic vs. glutamatergic spinal cord neuronal differentiation Cheng et al. , 2005 . While Pitx2 does not appear critical for GABAergic fate specification , it may regulate expression of genes that modulate other , as yet unidentified aspects of GABAergic neuronal function or maintenance . Potential roles for PITX2-positive GABAergic r1 neurons There are several important caveats to consider in our interpreta-tion of the functional and molecular identities of r1 PITX2-positive GABAergic interneurons . First , the molecular characteristics of r1 neu-rons are incompletely described in the literature , forcing us to rely on comparisons with spinal cord or other axial levels . For example , stud-ies showing that Dbx1-lineage cells in more caudal rhombomeres are responsible for regulating breathing have excluded r1 from their analysis Borday et al. , 2006 . Second , r1 is unique among rhombo-meres in that it develops through signaling from the isthmic organiz-er , does not express any Hox genes , and has unique requirements for Shh signaling Blaess et al. , 2006 Irving and Mason , 2000 Lebel et al. , 2007 . Nonetheless , the potential V0 and V2 GABAergic neurotrans-mitter identities of PITX2-positive cells and their transcription factor profiles are important for future studies exploring the functions of PITX2-positive cells in r1 . Ventral r1 contains many neurons that participate in critical life processes such as control of respiration Gray , 2008 . Locomotion is also controlled in part by the activities of ventral hindbrain interneu-ron populations Grossmann et al. , 2010 . Our studies provide evi-dence that r1 PITX2-positive GABAergic neurons are distinct from neurons of the trochlear motor nucleus , serotonergic neurons of the dorsal raphe , Lmx1a-positive parabrachial neurons , Phox2a b-positive visceral motor neurons , locus coeruleus neurons , and trigeminal neu-rons . Several nuclei in ventral r1 are known to contain GABAergic neurons including the dorsal raphe , laterodorsal tegmental nucleus , and pedunculopontine nucleus Mena-Segovia et al. , 2009 . In the ventral r1 field , the dorsal raphe is medial , the dorsal tegmental nu-cleus is in deep ventral r1 near the ventricle , while the pedunculo-pontine tegmental nucleus is more lateral and superficially localized Martin , 2003 Schambra et al. , 1992 . Based on GABAergic identity and localization , we predict that PITX2-positive cells contribute to the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus which is thought to be in-volved in local inhibition controlling locomotion , REM , alertness , and respiratory patterns Datta et al. , 2001 Kozak et al. , 2005 Saponjic et al. , 2005 Tsang et al. , 2010 . A modulatory role for PITX2-positive GABAergic neurons in respiration , alertness , or other important autonomic functions could help explain why Nestin-Cre conditional Pitx2 mutants fail to survive beyond the immediate post-natal period Sclafani et al. , 2006 . Further studies should help clarify the physiological roles of PITX2-positive hindbrain neurons and their potential contributions to control of locomotion , respiration , or other autonomic functions . Experimental methods Mice C57BL 6J mice were obtained from the Jackson Laboratory JAX 000664 .

21931131	PURPOSE . To examine the effect of free insulin-like growth factor IGF binding protein-3 IGFBP-3 , independent of the effect of insulin-like growth factors , in modulating retinal vas-cular permeability . METHODS . We assessed the ability of a form of IGFBP-3 that does not bind IGF-1 IGFBP-3NB , to regulate the blood retinal bar-rier BRB using two distinct experimental mouse models , laser-induced retinal vessel injury and vascular endothelial growth factor VEGF -induced retinal vascular permeability . Additionally , in vitro studies were conducted . In the animal models , BRB permeability was quantified by intravenous injec-tion of fluorescein labeled serum albumin followed by digital confocal image analysis of retinal flat-mounts . Claudin-5 and vascular endothelial-cadherin VE-cadherin localization at in-terendothelial junctions was studied by immunofluorescence . In vitro changes in transendothelial electrical resistance TEER and flux of fluorescent dextran in bovine retinal endothelial monolayers BREC were measured after IGFBP-3NB treatment . Acid ASMase and neutral NSMase sphingomyelinase mRNA levels and activity were measured in mouse retinas . RESULTS . Four days postinjury , laser-injured mouse retinas in-jected with IGFBP-3NB plasmid demonstrated reduced vascular permeability compared with retinas of laser-injured mouse retinas injected with control plasmid . IGFBP-3NB administra-tion resulted in a significant decrease in laser injury-associated increases in ASMase and NSMase mRNA and activity when R01DK090730 MBG , U01 HL087366 MBG , RO1 EY018358 MEB , and EY016077 JVB . Submitted for publication July 18 , 2011 revised August 23 , 2011 accepted August 29 , 2011 . compared with laser alone treated mice . In vivo , intravitreal injection of IGFBP-3NB reduced vascular leakage associated with intravitreal VEGF injection . IGFBP-3NB partially restored VEGF-induced in vivo permeability and dissociation of clau-din-5 and VE-cadherin at junctional complexes . When IGFBP-3NB was applied basally to bovine retinal endothelial cells BREC in vitro , TEER increased and macromolecular flux de-creased . CONCLUSIONS . Intravitreal administration of IGFBP-3NB pre-serves junctional integrity in the presence of VEGF or laser injury by reducing BRB permeability in part by modulating sphingomyelinase levels .

Breakdown of the blood retinal barrier BRB is a prominent feature of a wide range of retinal diseases including dia - feature of a wide range of retinal diseases including dia-betic retinopathy , venous occlusive diseases , and cystoid mac-ular edema.1,2 The inner BRB constitutes a remarkable physical and biochemical barrier between the retina and the circulation . The BRB is composed of a monolayer of nonfenestrated vascu-lar endothelial cells , which are surrounded by pericytes and glial cells.1 Endothelial cells control the infiltration of blood proteins and circulating cells through the vessel wall into the surrounding tissues . Endothelial permeability occurs by the paracellular pathway , which is mediated by the coordinated opening and closure of endothelial cell-cell junctions.3 Paracel-lular increases in endothelial permeability occur by the changes in adherens junction AJ and tight junction TJ -associated proteins.3–5 Cell-cell junctions act as signaling struc-tures which communicate cell position , limit growth , apopto-sis , and regulate vascular homeostasis . Cell-cell junctions maintain endothelial integrity and prevent exposure of the subendothelial matrix.3,4 AJs are formed by the homotypic association of the extracellular segments of members of the cadherin family of adhesion proteins . Retinal microvascular endothelial cells express high levels of vascular endothelial cadherin VE-cadherin .6 While the barrier function of the endothelium is supported by multiple intercellular adhesion systems , disruption of VE-cadherin is sufficient to disrupt all these intercellular junctions.7,8 In contrast to AJs , TJs are formed by membrane-spanning proteins claudins , occludins , and junctional adhesion molecules , which interact with cyto-plasmic proteins AF-6 and ZO-1 , -2 , -3 that regulate their assembly and maintenance.9 Of the claudin family , retinal vas-cular endothelial cells predominantly express types 1 , 3 , and 5.10–13 The molecular composition of tight junctions is highly regulated and changes rapidly in response to factors that affect Investigative Ophthalmology Visual Science , October 2011 , Vol . 52 , No. 11 Copyright 2011 The Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology , Inc . permeability . One of the factors implicated in disrupting the BRB integrity is vascular endothelial growth factor VEGF , also known as the vascular permeability factor , which is typically increased in the eyes of patients with retinopathies.14–16 Ceramide , the proinflammatory and proapoptotic messen-ger , increases vascular permeability by a mechanism that is not yet fully understood , but involves the regulation of both endo-thelial Ca2 signaling and nitric oxide NO formation.17–19 In response to both acute and chronic cutaneous permeability barrier disruption , sphingomyelinases SMases hydrolyze sph-ingomyelin to ceramide . Several isoforms of sphingomyelinases have been identified and are further distinguished by their catalytic pH optimum , cellular localization , primary structure , and cofactor dependence . Alkaline sphingomyelinase activity is confined to the intestinal mucosa , bile , and liver and does not participate in signal transduction.20–22 Neutral NSMase and acid ASMase sphingomyelinases , however , are crucially in-volved in the pathophysiology of metabolic disorders23 and play an active role in cellular signaling.24 Dysregulation of sphingolipid metabolism is believed to play a major role in many chronic diseases . Both NSMase and ASMase can be acti-vated by tumor necrosis factor TNF and interleukin-1 IL-1 to induce the proinflammatory state in tissues.25,26 Opreanu et al.27 report that docosahexaenoic acid DHA downregulates basal and cytokine-induced ASMase and NSMase activity in human retinal endothelial cells and inhibition of sphingomyeli-nases in retinal endothelial cells prevent cytokine-induced in-flammatory responses . Furthermore , ASMase is upregulated in the diabetic retina and blocking ASMase protects the retina from diabetes-induced damage.28 Previously , we and others , have examined the vascular protective effect of insulin-like growth factor IGF binding protein-3 IGFBP-3 in both the early developing and adult retinal vasculature . IGFBP-3 can reduce pathologic neovascu-larization in the oxygen-induced retinopathy OIR model29–31 and more importantly serum levels of IGFBP-3 predict the outcome of retinopathy of prematurity ROP , with increased IGFBP-3 levels associated with reduced ROP.30 IGFBP-3 in-creases recruitment of bone marrow-derived cells into areas of injured retina and facilitate vascular repair mechanisms31 and is neuroprotective.32 However , the effects of IGFBP-3 on perme-ability have not been studied . The purpose of this study was to determine whether free IGFBP-3 , independent of IGF-1 , can modulate the BRB . We used IGFBP-3NB in our experiments to assess the IGF-1 independent effects of IGFBP-3 in our studies , because this form of IGFBP-3 can not bind IGF-1.33–35 We as-sessed permeability in vivo using two murine retinal vascular injury models . We studied the direct effects of IGFBP-3 in the retina and asked whether IGFBP-3 modulates vascular barrier properties . We found that intravitreal administration of IGFBP-3NB protected the BRB by partially restoring tight junction and adherens junction integrity of murine retinal blood vessels , which is likely due to the ability of IGFBP-3 to decrease pro-inflammatory sphingomyelinase levels in injured retina . METHODS Animals Retinal Vessel Occlusion by Photocoagulation In Vivo Permeability Assay In Vitro Permeability Assay Immunofluoresence Histochemistry ASMase Activity Assay Statistical Analysis RESULTS IGFBP-3NB Expressing Plasmid Reduces Vascular Permeability in a Retinal Ischemia–Induced Laser Injury Model We first tested the effects of IGFBP-3NB in a laser injury model associated with retinal vascular leakage . In this model , laser injury initiates retinal vascular damage and subsequent vascular leakage . Retinas injected with IGFBP-3NB expressing plasmid alone or injected with the IGFBP-3NB expressing plasmid fol-lowed by laser injury demonstrated minimal leakage compared with the control plasmid-injected laser-treated retinas , which showed a dramatic increase in retinal vascular leakage Fig. 1 . IGFBP-3NB Reduces ASMase and NSMase mRNA and Activity Levels in a Retinal Ischemia–Induced Laser Injury Model Previously , we showed in this laser injury model that injection with IGFBP-3-expressing plasmid reduced the levels of cer-amide generated31 and reduced inflammation . Therefore , we questioned whether IGFBP-3NB reduced SMase levels in this model . As expected , laser-treated retinas showed a dramatic increase in ASMase and NSMase expression . Injection of IGFBP-3NB plasmid normalized ASMase and NSMase mRNA levels P 0.05 Figs . 2A , 2B . The ASMase mRNA levels were induced more than the NSMase mRNA levels in the laser-treated retinas . This corresponded to increased ASMase activity levels in the laser-treated retinas P 0.05 that was brought back to normal in the IGFBP-3NB and laser-treated retinas Fig. 2C . This suggests that IGFBP-3NB can reduce leakage in in-jured retinas by reducing SMase levels , particularly ASMase levels , which may promote BRB integrity . In addition to studying vascular permeability in the laser injury model , we also tested the effects of IGFBP-3NB in a VEGF-induced permeability model . We specifically asked whether IGFBP-3NB would directly impact VEGF-induced permeability . Figure 3A shows quantification of fluorescent leakage after either VEGF 40 nanograms microliter followed by IGFBP-3NB 40 nanograms microliter , VEGF alone , IGFBP-3NB alone , or the vehicle for VEGF , which was saline . VEGF injection in-creased permeability compared with vehicle-injected eyes . When IGFBP-3NB was injected post VEGF treatment , retinal vascular permeability was decreased . In Figures 3B–E , repre - sentative retinal whole mounts showing FITC albumin leakage from the retinal vessels of animals described in Figure 3A are shown . The vascular leakage induced by VEGF was attenuated by IGFBP-3NB administration . IGFBP-3NB Enhances In Vitro Retinal Endothelial Cell Barrier Characteristics To better understand vascular barrier protection by IGFBP-3 in the retina , we assessed its effect in cultures of isolated bovine retinal endothelial cells BREC . The addition of IGFBP-3NB to BREC monolayers led to a significant increase in TEER , which peaked within 5 minutes of protein addition . Significantly higher TEER were observed for at least 12 hours in cultures treated with IGFBP-3NB , suggesting that endothelial barrier was improved Fig. 4A . Consistent with this idea we also found that the macromolecular flux across BREC cultures was significantly reduced in the presence of IGFBP-3NB Fig. 4B . Flux of 40 kDa dextran was reduced by 50 % within half an hour of treatment and remained low during the next 12 hours . Taken together these data showed that IGFBP-3 can enhance the barrier function of the retinal vasculature by acting directly on retinal endothelial cells . IGFBP-3NB Prevents the Dissociation of Tight Junction and Adherens Junction Integrity after VEGF Injection To evaluate the integrity of the BRB , immunohistochemical analysis of retinal flat-mounts were performed for claudin-5 and VE-cadherin expression . Retinal flat-mounts were prepared from mice that underwent intravitreal injection of either VEGF , IGFBP-3NB , both IGFBP-3NB and VEGF , or saline . As shown in Figure 5 , saline-injected vehicle control eyes showed clear expression of claudin-5 in the retinal vessels Figs . 5A–C , as did the IGFBP-3NB-injected retinas Figs . 5D–F . In contrast , VEGF injected eyes displayed a significant attenuation of clau-din-5 expression in the retinal vessels Figs . 5G–L . However , in retinas in which VEGF was injected followed by injection of IGFBP-3NB , there was partial restoration of claudin-5 expres-sion in the retinal vessels Figs . 5M–O . VE-cadherin expression was apparent in the saline-injected vehicle control in the reti-nal vessels Figs . 6A–C . Likewise , the IGFBP-3NB-injected eyes demonstrated distinct VE-cadherin staining in the retinal ves-sels Figs . 6D–F . However , VEGF-injected eyes displayed a loss of VE-cadherin expression in the retinal vessels Figs . 6G–I and was similar in appearance to the VEGF followed by saline-injected retinas Figs . 6J–L . VEGF followed by IGFBP-3NB injection demonstrated no dissociation of VE-cadherin Figs . 6M–O . These results suggest that IGFBP-3NB partially pre-vents dissociation of adherens and tight junctions in eyes in-jected with VEGF . IGFBP-3NB Expression Decreases SMase mRNA Levels in VEGF-Injected Mice Our results suggest that IGFBP-3NB reduces vascular permea-bility induced by intravitreal injection of VEGF . To investigate a possible mechanism for this effect , mice underwent intravit - real injection with either IGFBP-3NB expressing plasmid or control plasmid and 4 days later retinas were exposed to recombinant VEGF protein . Twenty-four hours later , both AS-Mase and NSMase mRNA levels were measured in these retinas . Both ASMase and NSMase levels were increased by VEGF ad-ministration but were normalized in retinas of IGFBP-3NB plas-mid-injected eyes compared with retinas from control plasmid-injected eyes Fig. 7 . DISCUSSION In this study , we used either recombinant IGFBP-3NB or plas-mid expressing IGFBP-3NB , under the direction of an endothe-lial cell specific promoter , to examine the effects of free IGFBP-3 . Our results show that IGFBP-3 influences BRB integ-rity and does so independent of IGF binding . In vivo , IGFBP-3 reduces permeability induced by either direct VEGF adminis-tration or VEGF expression by laser occlusion-induced isch-emia . The deleterious effect of intravitreal VEGF on vascular per-meability in normal rats has been successfully blocked with an inhibitor of protein kinase C LY 333531 and by pigment epithelium-derived factor PEDF and placenta growth factor-1 PLGF in mice.37,39 LY 333531 also reduced BRB permeability in short-term diabetic rats . While we focused on the effects of IGFBP-3 on changes in the anterior blood retinal barrier , stud-ies already exist demonstrating that VEGF exposure of ARPE-19 cells results in increased expression of IGFBP-3,40,41 which we believe represents a direct protective response to VEGF-in-duced injury and suggests a protective role for IGFBP-3 in the retinal pigment epithelial cells RPE , which compose the pos-terior blood retinal barrier . Slomiany and Rosenzweig40 also report an autocrine loop of IGF-1-induced VEGF secretion with subsequent IGFBP-3 secretion in RPE cells . This suggests that under physiological conditions , there exists a delicate balance between the VEGF-IGF systems . Mukherjee and Guidry42 and Ainscough et al.43 further corroborated the beneficial effect of IGFBP-3 secretion in response to IGF-induced VEGF secretion in human RPE cells . In our in vivo laser studies , we infer that the prolonged IGFBP-3 expression generated by the plasmid acts to dampen the endogenous VEGF response to laser injury and likely explains the decrease in vascular permeability we observed . In agreement with our in vivo findings , IGFBP-3 reduced monolayer permeability of highly purified BREC cultures in vitro , indicating that its effect on vascular integrity could be attributed to direct action on retinal endothelial cells , rather than any perivascular cells . Barrier enhancement in response to IGFBP-3 occurred rapidly and was observed 5 minutes post treatment and was sustained for at least 12 hours . Barrier improvement increased TEER and a substantially reduced mac-romolecular flux , indicating that IGFBP-3 altered interendothe-lial junctions rather than vesicular transport in BREC . More-over , we demonstrated IGFBP-3 prevented dissociation of TJ and AJ in retinal blood vessels by partially restoring expression levels of claudin-5 and VE-cadherin , respectively . It is unclear whether in vivo IGFBP-3 that does bind to IGF-1 would act the same way as the nonbinder mutant however , there are several possibilities . The response to the mutant IGFBP-3 could be considered as the response to “free” IGFBP-3 not complexed to IGF-1 , which has physiological effects . However , the nonbinder mutant IGFBP-3 is not simply IGFBP-3 without IGF-1 on it . This particular IGFBP-3 is mutated at residues 80 , 81 , 217 , and 223 and residues 217 and 223 are involved in nuclear receptor binding Robert Baxter , unpub-lished . Because the mutant is active in reducing vascular permeability , this action does not require nuclear receptor binding or IGF binding , nonetheless wild type IGFBP-3 could still be modulated by nuclear receptor binding or IGF-1 bind-ing . Also , because IGF-1 is known to affect vascular permeabil-ity by stimulating VEGF , IGFBP-3 may oppose this by binding IGF-1 . This study shows that IGFBP-3 has a separate , IGF-independent action on VEGF-stimulated permeability . There-fore , IGFBP-3 could act in two ways inhibiting VEGF expres-sion by an IGF-binding-mediated mechanism or inhibiting VEGF action by an IGF-binding-independent mechanism . Previously , we have examined the effect of PEDF and PLGF on VEGF-induced vascular permeability using the identical ex-perimental design and time course as in the present study.37,38 In this study , we show that IGFBP-3NB can also block VEGF-induced vascular permeability . The in vivo effect of IGFBP-3NB was supported by our in vitro studies . IGFBP-3NB applied to the basal side of the endothelium in vitro demonstrated in-creased TEER and reduced macromolecular flux across the BREC monolayers . This basal administration represents ablu-menal administration as would occur during an intravitreal injection . We also showed that IGFBP-3NB reduced vascular permeability induced by VEGF administration or by laser-in-duced injury . Furthermore , we demonstrate that IGFBP-3NB facilitates the reassociation of tight junctions and adherens junctions in retinal blood vessels after their disassociation by VEGF . Using GFP chimeric mice that underwent the laser injury model , we showed that exposure of retinal vessels to IGFBP-3 increases recruitment of hematopoietic stem cells to sites of injury and their differentiation into endothelial cells , pericytes , and astrocytes.31,32 Pericyte and astrocyte ensheathment serve to strengthen the BRB after ischemia-induced injury , 31,32 which is consistent with our current findings . Astrocytes are known to play a role in maintaining the BRB , 44,45 while glial dysfunction has been linked to BRB breakdown.46 Astrocytes surround capillary endothelial cells and regulate retinal capil-laries by paracrine interactions.46,47 Equally important , IGFBP-3 can reduce inflammation as we previously reported , after vessel occlusion by laser injury , and was associated with a reduced retinal ceramide sphingomyelin ratio , which is an indicator of the inflammatory or proapoptotic state of cells.31 Our present study supports this as we show that IGFBP-3 reduces sphingomyelinase mRNA expression and activity lev-els in the laser-occluded retinas . This in turn would result in a decrease in the ceramide sphingomyelin ratio , since sphingo-myelinases are the enzymes responsible for the generation of ceramide from sphingomyelin Fig. 8 . We have shown previ-ously IGFBP-3 can reduce the number of activated microglial cells after retinal injury and can increase apoptosis of these cells lending support that IGFBP-3 is anti-inflammatory.32 In this same setting , IGFBP-3 reduces levels of activated macro-phages , while these studies are supportive of the effect of IGFBP-3 they were performed using the form of IGFBP-3 that binds IGF-1 making it difficult to exclude the contribution of IGF-1 to these findings.31 However , our current studies are in agreement with our earlier work showing IGFBP-3 can reduce inflammation in the retina , which can provide vascular stability to injured retinal vessels.31,32 Another novel finding of this study is that ASMase and NSMase activation is an integral part of VEGF or laser-induced increase in permeability . Inhibition of ASMase and or NSMase may represent an important part of the protective effects of IGFBP-3 . Activation of SMases leads to an increase in ceramide production and or another possible mediator , sphingosine-1-phosphate S1P . Previously , we and others , have shown that IGFBP-3 increases the expression of sphingosine kinase 1 SphK1 in both endothelial cells and epithelial cells.31,48,49 This in-crease in SphK1 serves to generate S1P . There are several studies showing S1P regulates endothelial cell barrier func-tion . Depending on the cellular milieu , the concentration of S1P and the type of injury or vascular bed , S1P can regulate vascular permeability.50 Zhang et al.51 report S1P prevents permeability increases via activation of endothelial S1P re-ceptor-1 in rat venules and Lee et al.52 show a balance of S1P1 and S1P2 signaling regulates peripheral microvascular permeability in rat muscle vasculature . Tauseef et al.53 show that activation of Sphk1 reverses the increase in lung vascu-lar permeability through S1P receptor signaling in endothe-lial cells . Also , Camerer and colleagues54 show S1P in the plasma compartment regulates basal and inflammation-induced vascular leak in mice . S1P can also influence tight junction protein integrity as Sun et al.55 reported an en-hanced interaction between focal adhesion and adherens junction proteins after S1P exposure . Also , noteworthy are the observations by Jensen et al.56 that show NSMase is critically involved in modulation of skin edema . In summary , we showed that IGFBP-3 can regulate BRB integrity as schematically illustrated in Figure 8 . Thus , by enhancing the BRB , IGFBP-3 can provide vascular stabiliza-tion to injured retinal vessels and preserve vascular integ-rity . IGFBP-3 , due to its beneficial effects on the restoration of tight junctions and adherens junctions , may represent a potential therapeutic agent in the treatment of eye diseases , such as retinopathies , where the BRB is commonly compro-mised .

Possible mechanism of IGFBP-3’s effects on VEGF and laser injury-induced retinal vascular permeability . Acid sphingomyelinase ASMase and neutral sphingomyelinase NSMase activation is an in-tegral part of VEGF or laser-induced injury , which leads to disruption of the BRB and increased permeability . ASMase and NSMase are the principle enzymes responsible for the generation of ceramide from sphingomyelin . IGFBP-3 reduces ASMase and NSMase mRNA expres-sion and activity levels after injury , which leads to a decrease in ceramide sphingomyelin ratio . IGFBP-3 also increases the expression of sphingosine kinase SK , which may serve to reduce ceramide further by using ceramide as a substrate for sphingosine and generation of sphingosine-1-phosphate S1P , which has also been shown to improve blood retinal barrier integrity . 
21940780	Mia C. Åkerfeldt and D. Ross Laybutt Tthe he critical contribution of deficient insulin se-cretion to the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes is accepted 1–3 . Despite the presence of insulin resistance at the level of peripheral tissues and the liver , majority of overweight and obese individuals do not develop diabetes because their pancreatic b-cells adequately respond and prevent overt hyperglycemia through increased insulin secretion . Diabetes arises when insulin secretion can not match insulin demand 1–3 . This failure of b-cell compensation is associated with a decline in insulin secretory function , which is manifested primarily as a selective loss of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion GSIS , and a reduction in b-cell mass , which is linked with an increased rate of apoptosis 1–5 . In animal models of diabetes , b-cells have been found to lose the unique differentiation pattern that optimizes GSIS 6–10 . Thus , genes that are highly expressed and thought to be involved in the function and maturation of the b-cell phenotype insulin , Glut2 , pancreatic duodenal homeobox-1 [ Pdx1 ] , and others are decreased with diabetes . In contrast , genes that are normally suppressed and would theoreti-cally interfere with optimal b-cell function are increased . While this altered phenotype may underlie the loss of insulin secretion in diabetes , the cellular and molecular mechanisms causing b-cell dedifferentiation have not been identified . In the db db mouse model of type 2 diabetes , we recently found that insulin secretory dysfunction and a loss of b-cell differentiation were associated with in-creased islet expression of the helix-loop-helix HLH pro-tein Id1 8 . Id1 is a member of a family of proteins Id1–4 that are capable of inhibiting differentiation 11–15 . Id proteins are negative regulators of HLH transcription factors 15–17 but can also act via non-HLH proteins 14 . Expression of Id1 in other cell types is associated with cell growth , en-hanced proliferation , and dedifferentiation 11–15 . Id1 has been extensively studied for its potential role in the cancer process , since high Id1 expression along with enhanced proliferation and dedifferentiation characterizes transformed cells 11 . Previous reports have demonstrated that Id1 expression is induced in vitro in chronically fatty acid–treated MIN6 b-cells , a model that is characterized by insulin secretory dysfunction and b-cell dedifferentiation 18 . In a similar manner , Id1 expression is induced by glucose in human islets and insulin-secreting cell lines but not in liver or other non–b-cell lines 19,20 . However , the role of Id1 expression in the regulation of insulin secretion and b-cell gene expression has not been examined . Here we studied the effects of Id1 deletion on glucose tolerance , insulin secretion , and b-cell gene expression in mice . We also studied the consequences of small interfering RNA siRNA -mediated inhibition of Id1 in the MIN6 cell model of chronic fatty acid exposure . The studies provide novel evidence that Id1 expression inhibits insulin secre-tion and plays a crucial role in the development of glucose intolerance and b-cell dedifferentiation under conditions of chronic lipid oversupply . See accompanying commentary , p. 2455 . RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Measurement of b-cell mass , islet number , and apoptosis . Sections RESULTS Metabolic characteristics of wild-type and Id12 2 mice fed a chow or a high-fat diet . In mice fed a chow diet , body weight , epididymal fat pad weight , liver weight , and energy intake were not significantly different in wild-type and Id12 2 mice Fig. 1A–D . In a similar manner , blood glucose , insulin , plasma glucagon , triglyceride , and NEFA levels were unchanged , although a trend toward slightly lower blood glucose levels was observed in Id12 2 mice Table 1 . Thus , consistent with previous descrip-tions 12 , Id12 2 mice develop without obvious metabolic abnormalities . High-fat feeding of wild-type and Id12 2 mice for 6 weeks led to significant increases in body weight , fat pad weight , and energy intake , which was similar in both genotypes Fig. 1A–D . Liver weight was not affected by high-fat feeding in either genotype Fig. 1C . Insulin and triglyceride levels were significantly increased by high-fat feeding in both genotypes , whereas glucagon and NEFA levels were unchanged Table 1 . There was a tendency for slightly higher blood glucose levels in both wild-type and Id12 2 mice after high-fat feeding Table 1 . HOMA-IR scores calculated from blood glucose and insulin levels were increased by fat feeding irrespective of genotype Table 1 , suggestive of fat-induced insulin resistance in both groups of mice . Thus , Id12 2 mice displayed several characteristic features of metabolic disorder induced by high-fat diet , including increased body weight and fat ac-cumulation , elevated circulating triglycerides , and insulin resistance . Id12 2 mice exhibit improved glucose tolerance . To determine whether Id1 plays a role in the regulation of glucose tolerance , we performed intraperitoneal GTT in wild-type and Id12 2 mice fed a chow or a high-fat diet for 6 weeks . After 6 h of fasting , blood glucose levels were similar among the diets and genotypes indicated at 0 min Fig. 2A . After intraperitoneal glucose administration in mice fed a chow diet , blood glucose levels Fig. 2A and the resultant area under the curve AUC for glucose val-ues from 0–90 min Fig. 2B were significantly reduced in Id12 2 mice compared with wild-type mice . This indicates that Id1 deletion leads to improved glucose tolerance in chow-fed mice Fig. 2A and B . Compared with chow-fed mice , high-fat feeding of wild-type mice led to signifi-cantly increased blood glucose levels after the intraperito-neal bolus Fig. 2A and B , indicating that as expected , a 6-week exposure to a high-fat diet results in marked glu-cose intolerance . It is striking that Id12 2 mice were almost completely protected from glucose intolerance induced by high-fat diet Fig. 2A and B . After the glucose challenge , the blood glucose levels of fat-fed Id12 2 mice were only slightly elevated compared with levels in chow-fed Id12 2 mice , and they remained below the range observed in chow-fed wild-type mice Fig. 2A and B . These data provide the first evidence that deletion of Id1 confers protection against diet-induced glucose intolerance . This protective effect in Id12 2 mice was also observed after a prolonged 18-week period of high-fat feeding Supplementary Fig. 1 . In contrast , deletion of Id3 did not affect glucose tol-erance in chow-or fat-fed mice Supplementary Fig. 2 . TABLE 1 Taken together , the data suggest a specific role of Id1 , and not its closely related Id3 family member 12,23 , in the regulation of glucose tolerance in mice . Improved glucose tolerance in Id12 2 mice is associ-ated with increased insulin levels . During the in - traperitoneal GTT , insulin levels Fig. 2C and the resultant AUC for insulin Fig. 2D were significantly increased in Id12 2 mice compared with wild-type controls . This was particularly evident after high-fat feeding . Compared with chow-fed controls , fat-fed wild-type mice exhibited higher fasting insulin levels indicated at 0 min Fig. 2C , but these did not increase further after intraperitoneal glucose ad-ministration Fig. 2C , despite the presence of marked hy-perglycemia Fig. 2A . In contrast , in fat-fed Id12 2 mice , insulin levels were significantly increased after intraperi-toneal glucose administration Fig. 2C and D . These findings indicate that the ability of Id12 2 mice to improve glucose tolerance is associated with enhanced circulating insulin levels , especially in the face of insulin resistance induced by high-fat diet . Id1 deletion does not affect insulin action . To inves - tigate whether changes in insulin action contribute to the improved glucose tolerance in Id12 2 mice , we performed intraperitoneal ITT in wild-type and Id12 2 mice fed a chow or a high-fat diet . Chow-fed wild-type and Id12 2 mice exhibited similar time-course changes in blood glucose lev-els after insulin injection Fig. 3A . Accordingly , the AUC of glucose values from 0–30 min after insulin injection were similar in both genotypes Fig. 3B . After high-fat feeding , the blood glucose response to insulin was delayed in both wild-type and Id12 2 mice , indicating that diet-induced in-sulin resistance was not affected by the deletion of Id1 . This suggests that the improved glucose tolerance in Id12 2 mice is a consequence of increased insulin levels , rather than changes in insulin action . Id1 might therefore inhibit insulin secretion , particularly under conditions of increased lipid supply . Id1 deletion does not affect b-cell mass or islet number . We next investigated potential mechanisms re-sponsible for the increased insulin levels observed after a glucose challenge in Id12 2 mice . To determine whether Id1 plays a role in the regulation of b-cell mass , we per-formed morphometric analyses of pancreas sections from wild-type and Id12 2 mice fed a chow or a high-fat diet . There were no differences in b-cell mass or in the number of islets between wild-type and Id12 2 mice fed a chow diet Fig. 4A and B . As observed previously 24 , b-cell mass was increased in fat-fed mice , but this occurred irre-spective of the genotype Fig. 4A . In a similar manner , high-fat feeding increased the number of islets in both genotypes Fig. 4B . We found no evidence of b-cell apoptosis irrespective of genotype or diet . These data suggest that changes in b-cell capacity do not contribute to the in-creased insulin levels in Id12 2 mice . Islets from Id12 2 mice display enhanced insulin se-cretion . To investigate the role of Id1 in insulin secretion , we assessed GSIS in islets isolated from wild-type and Id12 2 mice fed either a chow or a high-fat diet . Compared with chow-fed mice , insulin secretion at a low stimulatory level of glucose 2.8 mmol L was significantly increased in islets isolated from fat-fed mice Fig. 5 . This fat diet– induced enhancement of insulin secretion at low glucose was greater in islets from Id12 2 mice compared with wild-type controls , suggesting that Id1 expression inhibits basal secretion under conditions of lipid oversupply . At a high stimulatory level of glucose 16.7 mmol L , insulin secretion in islets isolated from Id12 2 mice was signifi-cantly increased compared with wild-type controls Fig. 5 , especially after high-fat feeding . Note , islet insulin content Supplementary Fig. 3 and total protein levels Supple-mentary Fig. 4 were similar between the genotypes , and no differences were detected in KCl-stimulated insulin secretion Supplementary Fig. 5 . These results suggest that Id1 expression inhibits GSIS in mouse islets , partic-ularly under conditions of lipid oversupply and or insulin resistance . The increased insulin levels in mice with Id1 deletion are therefore likely the result of enhanced insulin release from islets . Id12 2 mice are protected against diet-induced loss of b-cell gene expression . We next examined expression of several genes involved in the maintenance and specialized function of the b-cell phenotype . mRNA levels were assessed in islets isolated from wild-type and Id12 2 mice fed a chow or a high-fat diet . Id1 mRNA levels were in-creased by twofold in islets from fat-fed mice compared with chow-fed controls Fig. 6A . Id1 mRNA levels were undetectable in islets from Id12 2 mice not shown . Expression of the islet hormones , insulin and glucagon , were not affected by either diet or genotype Fig. 6B . Pdx1 and Beta2 are transcription factors that are important for the maintenance of b-cell differentiation 25 . mRNA levels of Pdx1 and Beta2 were significantly reduced in islets of fat-fed wild-type mice Pdx1 was downregulated by 40 % and Beta2 by 30 % Fig. 6B . It is striking that in islets from fat-fed Id12 2 mice , expression of Pdx1 and Beta2 were maintained at levels observed in chow-fed mice Fig. 6B . We next evaluated several genes involved in b-cell glucose metabolism . The glucose transporter Glut2 and the ana-plerotic enzyme pyruvate carboxylase Pc were down-regulated in islets from fat-fed wild-type mice , whereas these metabolic genes were not affected by high-fat feed-ing in Id12 2 islets Fig. 6B . Not all genes involved in glucose metabolism were altered glucokinase mRNA lev-els were unchanged by diet or genotype . The G-protein– coupled receptor Gpr40 may play a role in both fatty acid and glucose stimulation of insulin secretion 26–28 . Consistent with previous findings 26 , we found that Gpr40 expression was downregulated by 50 % in fat-fed wild-type mice Fig. 6B . In contrast , Gpr40 expression was unchanged after fat feeding in Id12 2 mice Fig. 6B . These data demonstrate that islets from Id12 2 mice are FIG . 3 .

The role of cellular stress and stress re-sponse mediators in the failure of b-cells in diabetes has been the subject of much recent attention 29,30 . BiP is an endoplasmic reticulum ER chaperone and key regulator of the ER stress response 31 , and XBP1 and Chop are ER stress-inducible transcription factors 30,32 . It is interesting that both BiP and Chop mRNA levels were significantly re-duced in islets from Id12 2 mice compared with wild-type controls Fig. 6B . Also reduced in Id12 2 islets were levels of the spliced activated form of Xbp1 mRNA fold change , wild-type chow 1.00 6 0.02 wild-type fat 1.04 6 0.04 Id12 2 chow 0.94 6 0.04 Id12 2 fat 0.92 6 0.03 P , 0.05 for genotype effect . The antioxidant heme oxygenease-1 Ho-1 is induced by oxidative stress 33 . Ho-1 mRNA levels were significantly reduced in islets of Id12 2 mice compared with wild-type controls Fig. 6B . These data indicate that the augmentation of insulin secretion is ac-companied by reduced stress gene expression in islets from Id12 2 mice . Id1 plays a role in regulating insulin secretory changes that accompany chronic palmitate exposure in MIN6 cells . To examine the role of Id1 in insulin secretion in b-cells , we used the highly differentiated and glucose re-sponsive mouse insulinoma b-cell line , MIN6 34 . Chronic exposure of MIN6 cells to elevated fatty acids has previously been shown to induce mild insulin secretory dysfunction and changes in gene expression consistent with a loss of b-cell differentiation 18 . Exposure of MIN6 cells to the saturated fatty acid palmitate 0.4 mmol L palmitate cou-pled to 0.92 % BSA for 48 h led to a twofold increase in Id1 mRNA levels Fig. 7A . MIN6 cells were transfected with Id1 or control siRNA . Id1 siRNA transfection led to re-duced Id1 mRNA Fig. 7A and protein Fig. 7B levels in MIN6 cells exposed to palmitate or BSA . We next assessed insulin secretion under these experimental con-ditions . In control siRNA-treated cells , chronic palmitate exposure significantly reduced the subsequent insulin se-cretory response to high glucose stimulation Fig. 7C . In contrast , the insulin secretory response to high glucose stimulation was maintained in palmitate-treated MIN6 cells after knockdown of Id1 with siRNA Fig. 7C , suggesting a requirement of Id1 expression in the fatty acid–mediated decrease in insulin secretion . We also measured cellular insulin content in these treatment groups . Consistent with previous studies 18,35,36 , cellular insulin content was significantly reduced in fatty acid–treated cells Fig. 7D . However , this was not affected by Id1 knockdown chronic palmitate treatment led to a similar depletion of cellular insulin content in control siRNA-and Id1 siRNA-transfected cells Fig. 7D . The recalculation of insulin secretion as a function of total insulin content negated the change in insulin secretion as a result of palmitate exposure in control siRNA-transfected cells Fig. 7E . However , the data em-phasize the significantly increased insulin secretory re-sponse to high glucose stimulation in palmitate-pretreated MIN6 after knockdown of Id1 Fig. 7E . In a similar manner , FIG. 5 . Effects of Id1 deletion on GSIS ex vivo in isolated islets . Batches of islets isolated from wild-type mice fed a chow striped bar , n 6 or a high-fat white bar , n 7 diet and Id12 2 mice fed a chow hatched bar , n 7 or a high-fat black bar , n 5 diet were incubated at low 2.8 mmol L or high glucose 16.7 mmol L for 1 h . Insulin was measured in an aliquot of the media by radioimmunoassay . *P 0.05 for effect of fat diet in wild-type mouse islets at low glucose , **P 0.01 for effect of fat diet in Id12 2 mouse islets at low glucose , †P 0.05 for effect of genotype in fat-fed mouse islets at low and high glucose , and ††P 0.01 for effect of genotype in chow-fed mouse islets at high glucose . increased insulin secretion was found in palmitate-pretreated islets with Id1 deletion Supplementary Fig. 6 . Taken together , the data suggest that Id1 expression inhibits secretory function without affecting insulin content under conditions of increased lipid supply . Id1 plays a role in regulating gene expression changes that accompany chronic palmitate exposure in MIN6 cells . We next investigated the role of Id1 in the regulation of gene expression in MIN6 cells . Chronic 48-h palmitate treatment of control MIN6 cells led to reduced expression of Pdx1 , Pc , Gpr40 , and Glut2 , whereas insulin mRNA levels were not affected Fig. 8 . It is striking that the knockdown of Id1 in MIN6 cells prevented the palmitate-mediated downregulation of Pdx1 , Pc , and Gpr40 Fig. 8 . On the other hand , Glut2 was not affected by Id1 siRNA . Knockdown of Id1 in palmitate-treated cells significantly increased Pdx1 by 50 % , Pc by 20 % , and Gpr40 by 40 % compared with control palmitate-treated cells . Although not reduced by palmitate treatment in control MIN6 cells , Beta2 mRNA levels were significantly increased by 20 % in palmitate-treated cells after knockdown of Id1 Fig. 8 . These results suggest that Id1 expression is necessary for the downregulation of several important b-cell genes under conditions of chronic lipid oversupply . In addition , the knockdown of Id1 prevented the palmitate-mediated upregulation of stress genes BiP , Chop , Ho-1 Fig. 8 , and spliced Xbp1 palmitate treatment induced the levels of spliced Xbp1 mRNA by 1.07 6 0.01 fold in control cells and by 1.03 6 0.003 fold in cells with Id1 knockdown P , 0.05 for effect of Id1 siRNA . DISCUSSION The molecular mechanisms by which factors such as lipids and glucose contribute to b-cell failure in type 2 diabetes have been the subject of much attention . We have shown that ablation of Id1 improves whole body glucose disposal by augmenting insulin secretion . This enhanced insulin release compensates for insulin resistance and is associ-ated with reduced stress gene expression within islets and protection from lipid-mediated b-cell dedifferentiaton . These findings suggest a novel role of Id1 in the devel-opment of b-cell dysfunction and glucose intolerance . The improved glucose tolerance with ablation of Id1 is likely the result of direct effects in b-cells . Energy intake , body weight , fat accumulation , glucagon levels , and insulin action were similar in the absence of Id1 expression , and an equivalent degree of insulin resistance was evident after high-fat feeding . Furthermore , the phenotype of enhanced insulin secretion and protection against b-cell dediffer-entiaton in Id12 2 mice is broadly recapitulated in MIN6 cells after knockdown of Id1 using siRNA . It is interesting that enhanced GSIS was dependent on prior lipid exposure in MIN6 cells and was also most apparent in fat-fed mice . These striking outcomes likely represent the effects of chronically elevated Id1 expression under conditions of prolonged lipid oversupply compared with the more subtle effects of low-level Id1 expression in normal b-cells . While conditions of chronic lipid oversupply were examined in the current study , we do not rule out the possibility that Id1 expression is also involved in the b-cell secretory dysfunction induced by other factors , including chroni-cally increased glucose levels 8 . Although additional mechanisms may contribute , re-duced levels of cellular stress and protection against loss of b-cell gene expression may underlie the improvement in insulin secretion after Id1 ablation . The loss of b-cell gene expression has been linked to secretory dysfunction in several animal models of diabetes 6–10 . The current study demonstrates that Id1 expression is required for the dysregulation of several b-cell genes under conditions of chronic lipid oversupply . This includes the downregulation of important b-cell transcription factors Pdx1 and Beta2 , which could contribute to the altered expression of genes essential for GSIS 25 . Furthermore , we demonstrate that Id1 expression is required for the downregulation of Gpr40 expression , which has potentially important implications for GSIS and its potentiation by fatty acids 26–28 . Cel-lular stress can play a major role in the severity of b-cell dedifferentiation and dysfunction 29,30,33,37 . That Id1 could be involved in oxidative stress is supported by a study in cardiac myocytes 38 . Islets from Id12 2 mice may be less susceptible to stress and , consequently , better able to adapt to demanding conditions such as occur with chronic lipid oversupply and insulin resistance . It is note-worthy that forced expression of Id1 in insulinoma cells has been shown to inhibit insulin promoter activity 39 . However , the increased levels of Id1 expression in fat-fed mouse islets and lipid-treated MIN6 cells approximately twofold in both models are associated with unchanged insulin mRNA levels . Furthermore , the beneficial effects of Id1 inhibition on insulin secretion occur without changes in insulin transcription or insulin content that is , cellular insulin depletion was not affected by knockdown of Id1 in lipid-treated MIN6 cells Fig. 7D , and the intensity of insulin staining was similar in pancreas sections of wild-type and Id12 2 mice fed a high-fat diet not shown . Thus , under the conditions of the current study , abnor-malities in the glucose-sensing machinery accompany Id1 expression , whereas insulin expression is better main-tained . A similar phenomenon was observed in several animal models of diabetes in which glucose-sensing genes and islet transcription factors were reduced in the early mild phases of the disease , whereas insulin levels were af-fected only after progression to more severe stages 6,8,9 . In other cell types , Id proteins are implicated in a num-ber of cellular processes , including cell cycle regulation , growth , and proliferation 11–15,40 . It is noteworthy that Id2 expression may play a role in the expansion of pancre-atic ductal progenitor cells and b-cells 41,42 . Moreover , several cell cycle and early growth response genes that could interact with Id1 are important for the regulation of b-cell growth 43–48 . Our studies show that Id1 expression is not required for the establishment of normal b-cell mass in adult mice or for its expansion after high-fat feeding . This suggests that the effects of Id1 expression on b-cell differentiation are direct and independent of proliferation . It is interesting that a role for Id1 in promoting the b-cell phenotype has been proposed 20 . Thus , Id1 regulation of the b-cell phenotype may be well correlated with the effects of glucose and fatty acids after both acute stimu-latory and chronic inhibitory exposure . Whether Id1-mediated inhibition of b-cell differentiation is the result of the ability of Id proteins to sequester HLH transcription factors and inhibit E-box activation of tran-scription is not known . It is worth noting that HLH tran-scription factors , such as Beta2 , are important for pancreas development and b-cell differentiation 25,49,50 . However , an interaction with Beta2 would be expected to also affect insulin gene transcription 51 . Possible mechanisms by which Id1 expression mediates its effects include the cre-ation of an imbalance between E proteins and binding partners or interactions with Pax proteins or members of the transforming growth factor-b family 11–15 . In conclusion , we have identified a novel role of Id1 in the negative regulation of insulin secretion and b-cell dif-ferentiation . Studies from Id12 2 mice and MIN6 cells dem-onstrate that the beneficial effects of Id1 inhibition include augmentation of insulin secretion , reduced islet stress , and protection from lipid-induced glucose intolerance and b-cell dedifferentiation . The findings suggest that Id1 expression may provide a molecular link between chronic lipid oversupply and b-cell dedifferentiation and dysfunction . Id1 may therefore represent a new target for interventions aimed at improving disordered glucose homeostasis and b-cell dysfunction .

In addition , these molecules influence the migration of neurons Kerjan et al. , 2005 Marin and Rubenstein , 2003 Raper , 2000 Tamag-none and Comoglio , 2004 and glial cells Cohen et al. , 2003 Spassky et al. , 2002 Taniguchi et al. , 2009 . Semaphorins are well characterized as brain circuit regulators but are also involved in the responses of the im-mune system Kikutani and Kumanogoh , 2003 as well as in cardiovas-cular development Kruger et al. , 2005 Toyofuku et al. , 2004 , among other less characterized , organogenetic programs reviewed in Roth et al. , 2008 . While in vertebrates the most studied semaphorins are secreted proteins that diffuseover the extracellular matrix class 3 semaphorins , several members are transmembrane classes 4 to 6 or membrane-attached proteins class 7 Semaphorin Nomenclature Committee , 1999 . When expressed on the surface of neurons , these semaphorins affect the formation of synapses during development , or plasticity events in the adult Dityatev et al. , 2008 Skaper et al. , 2001 . Various studies have addressed class 3 semaphorins and CNS lesions Kaneko et al. , 2006 Lee et al. , 2010 Pasterkamp and Verhaagen , 2001 . Howev-er , transmembrane counterparts may also be involved in these effects , especially class 4 semaphorins , which constitute the largest transmem-brane subclass Raper , 2000 . In fact , Sema4D induces growth cone col-lapse of CNS axons Giraudon et al. , 2004 Swiercz et al. , 2002 , it is expressed by oligodendrocytes and it is upregulated after adult CNS le-sion Moreau-Fauvarque et al. , 2003 . In the Peripheral Nervous System PNS , Sema4F is involved in the maintenance of Schwann cell–axon interaction through downregulation of the Ras Raf ERK pathway Parrinello et al. , 2008 . Of note , some reports point to a double role of oligodendroglial cells as being synthesizers of and sensitive to multiple members of the semaphorin family Cohen , 2005 Taniguchi et al. , 2009 . Class 5 and class 6 semaphorins in the CNS have also been reported . Sema5A is specific of oligodendroglial lineage and it inhibits axon growth Goldberg et al. , 2004 Hilario et al. , 2009 Kantor et al. , 2004 as well as glioma cell motility via plexinA3 Li and Lee , 2010 . Class 6 semaphorins are potent inhibitors of axon outgrowth via plex-ins Rünker et al. , 2008 Suto et al. , 2007 Tawarayama et al. , 2010 Xu et al. , 2000 . Semaphorin receptors are multimeric Zhou et al. , 2008 . They al-ways include a member of the single transmembrane-spanning pro-teins called plexins , which contain a conserved sema domain of inhibitory action , and an intracellular GTPase-activating GAP do-main Gherardi et al. , 2004 Jackson and Eickholt , 2009 Oinuma et al. , 2004 . Concerning class 3 semaphorin receptors , these consist of plexins and neuropilins , the latter acting as co-receptors reviewed in Kruger et al. , 2005 Pasterkamp and Kolodkin , 2003 . Ig-CAMs and other membrane-attached molecules contribute to the signaling mediated by diffusible semaphorins reviewed in Zhou et al. , 2008 . Compelling evidence points to the proteolytic cleavage of mem-brane-associated semaphorins to generate soluble proteins that add further diversity to the signaling process Chabbert-de Ponnat et al. , 2005 Zhu et al. , 2007 . Recent studies performed on peripheral neu-rons demonstrate that transmembrane semaphorins interact with their receptors either in cis or in trans , thereby leading to differential responses Haklai-Topper et al. , 2010 . Class 4 semaphorins show an immunoglobulin-like domain next to their Sema domain and a short intracellular tail , which includes proline-rich sequences and a phosphorylation consensus sequence in the case of Sema4F Encinas et al. , 1999 Semaphorin Nomencla-ture Committee , 1999 . This semaphorin is known to interact with specific scaffolding proteins such as PSD-95 in the CNS and is thus as-cribed to neurons at glutamatergic synapses Schultze et al. , 2001 . Here we describe the distribution of Sema4F in the developing as well as in the adult brain . We show that this molecule is expressed by neurons and oligodendrocytes furthermore , we provide evidence of the participation of Sema4F in oligodendrocyte precursor migration . Results Sema4F transcript is widely expressed in mouse brain during development To determine the expression pattern of Sema4F in mouse brain , we first studied its distribution by in situ hybridization ISH using a 1.6 kb-long RNA probe coding for the extracellular region of rat Sema4F eSema4F . This probe , which was called We , was over 97 % homologous to the mouse sequence Encinas et al. , 1999 Fig. 1 . Sema4F transcripts were widely expressed in most brain regions dur-ing development , from E14 onwards Figs . 1A and M . Staining was particularly strong at E16-P0 Figs . 1B , D , E , G , H and L . Expression remained high during postnatal development Figs . 1N and O , and was still significant in adult mouse sections , although clearly de-creased Figs . 1C , F , I , J , K and P . The cerebellum , which was widely reactive at postnatal ages Fig. 1O , remained strongly stained during adulthood , mostly in the granular layer , although the deep nuclei were also significantly stained arrows in Fig. 1P . A Northern blot assay using total brain RNA showed a single transcript expressed at different ages , which was especially prominent at P0 Fig. 2A . At embryonic stages , mRNA expression was particularly high in the proliferative layers e.g. , ganglionic eminence at E14 , Fig. 1A , neu-roepithelium at E16 , Fig. 1D as well as in the anterior subventricular zone aSVZ at early postnatal stages Fig. 1H . At postnatal ages , pre-cursor cells from the aSVZ are known to migrate through the rostral migratory stream RMS , which is stained in the adult Fig. 1J , to the olfactory bulb Fig. 1K , which is also rich in labeled cells in the adult . Most young postmitotic neurons also expressed Sema4F tran-scripts cortical plate , Figs . 1A and D early pyramidal and granular cells of the hippocampus , Fig. 1E . In the adult brain , Sema4F was expressed by many neuronal populations see Table 1 for a detailed pattern . In addition to neurons , transcripts of this protein were also expressed in cells resembling glial cells arrows in Figs . 1B and E see also Fig. 5 . For instance , the arrows in Figs . 1B and E point at the oligodendroglial precursor migratory pathway OMP of the hip-pocampus the corpus callosum , devoid of neurons , is clearly labeled at P0 Fig. 1G see also Fig. 5 . Labeling with the We probe indicates that Sema4F transcripts are widely expressed by neuronal precursors , glial cells and postmitotic neurons in the developing and adult brain . Distribution of Sema4F protein in brain during development To study the distribution of Sema4F , a rabbit antiserum was raised against an extracellular peptide distal to the Sema domain residues 567 to 587 of murine Sema4F Encinas et al. , 1999 . We purified the IgG fraction , which we named anti-4F , and used it for immunochem-ical studies . Anti-4F was previously tested for specificity in COS1 cells transfected with a Myc-tagged full-length Sema4F-coding expression vector Fig. 2B . Similarly , Western blot WB against cell lysates from Myc-tagged Sema4F-transfected COS1 cells yielded prominent bands that were not detected in cells transfected with other transmembrane semaphorins Fig. 2C . Finally , we show that our anti-4F antiserum immunoprecipitates Sema4F Fig. 2D . In WB assays , Sema4F was detected as a single band of about 150 kDa in neural tissue from E15 onwards Sema4F was especially abundant in the cerebral cortex at perinatal stages , decreasing in this region from P5 onwards Fig. 2E . In the cerebellum , it was espe-cially abundant at postnatal stages . In the adulthood , the protein was detected mainly in the cerebellum , hippocampus and cerebral cortex Fig. 2E . Interestingly , an additional band of around 75–80 kDa found exclusively in the adult brain was also observed noted as ** in Fig. 2E . We next performed an immunohistochemical analysis . Overall , the pattern of Sema4F immunoreactivity IR overlapped the patterns of mRNA expression thus , most brain regions expressed Sema4F pro-tein from E14 onwards Figs . 3A and L . Expression was especially prominent in the olfactory bulb , cerebral cortex , hippocampus and brain stem . At E14 , however , some proliferative layers expressing Sema4F mRNA did not show protein staining compare GEm in Figs . 1A and 3A , thereby suggesting delayed protein expression . Immuno-labelling was high between E16 and P0 Figs . 3B , D , E , G , H and K . The hippocampus was strongly labeled at E18 Figs . 3B and E and the IR remained significant at P15 Fig. 3F and in the adult Fig. 3C . The aSVZ was strongly stained around P0 Fig. 3H , and was still reactive in the adult Fig. 3I . The olfactory bulb was also stained along devel-opment and in the adult , mainly in the mitral cell layer and the glo-merular layer Fig. 3N . The RMS was equally stained Fig. 3M . The CP was reactive at embryonic ages Figs . 3A , B and D and the cerebral cortex until the adulthood , IR being especially outstanding in the en-torhinal cortex Fig. 3J . The hypothalamus showed faint although widespread IR at embryonic ages Fig. 3B , which was higher in par-ticular areas at postnatal ages Fig. 3O . Of note , a remarkable inten-sity was found near the arcuate and posterior hypothalamic nuclei at P10 Fig. 3O see also Fig. 5 , an OMP region near the third ventri-cle , through which oligodendroglial precursors migrate at previous ages . In the hindbrain , several nerve nuclei were prominently stained , such as the oculomotor nucleus , the periaqueductal gray area , the col-liculli , raphe and pararubral nuclei Fig. 3K . The facial nucleus was also immunoreactive at P0 Fig. 3L , pointed as 7nu and most cell types of the cerebellum were reactive during development and also in the adult Figs . 3P and Q . Sema4F expression was low although significant in adult neurons Figs . 3C , F , J , N and Q and , in the hippo-campus , it was particularly relevant in the apical dendrites of CA1 py-ramidal neurons squares in Suppl . Fig. 1A and around the granular cell bodies of the dentate gyrus squares in Suppl . Fig. 1B . To gain insight into the fine localization of Sema4F protein , we performed immunocytochemical analyses of hippocampal tissue at Table 1 Telencephalon CA1 , CA2 , CA3 Diencephalon Mesencephalon Hindbrain -+ + ++ ++ -+ -+ -+ -+ +++ +++ ++ ++ ++ ++ the electron microscopic level . We show that Sema4F IR was present mainly in cell bodies and dendrites . Interestingly , these dendrites were from pyramidal neurons , displaying immunoreactivity in den-dritic shafts and in dendritic spines Figs . 4A and B , as well as from hippocampal interneurons exhibiting multiple synaptic contacts over their dendritic shafts Fig. 4C . We were unable to find signifi-cant IR in presynaptic terminals . These data indicate that Sema4F lo-calizes preferentially to postsynaptic compartments . Sema4F in neuronal and oligodendroglal cells , and in migrating oligo-dendrocyte precursors The most remarkable anti-4F IR corresponded to neuronal cells and their precursors . However , labeling of the transcript and IR were also evident in mature oligodendocytes of the adult corpus cal-losum arrows in Figs . 3I and 5I arrows pointing at cells with a typi-cally elongated shape in Fig. 5H and in regions rich in oligodendroglial precursors OPCs , as are the mamillothalamic tract at E14 Fig. 3A , the embryonic fimbria Figs . 1B , E and 3B , E and the early postnatal hypothalamus Figs . 3O and 5A . In the main fiber tracts , Sema4F tran-script and protein were found in cells of oligodendroglial shape as early as at P0 , both in the corpus callosum Figs . 1G and 3G , arrows in Fig. 5F and in the anterior commissure arrows in Fig. 5G . Even at P15 , Sema4F-expressing cells were still found near the arcuate nu-cleus Figs . 5B and C . ISH assays showed these regions to be rich in Sema4F-transcribing cells at P10 Figs . 5D and E . We performed double-labeling experiments on E16 embryonic sections , which we stained for Sema4F and the oligodendroglially expressed transcription factor Olig2 . Some Olig2-positive cells were found intermingled in the wide field of Sema4F-expressing cells around the 3rd ventricle Figs . 6A–C and in the cerebellar primordi-um Figs . 6D–F . Virtually , all Olig2-positive cells were co-stained and immunolabeled with anti-4F antibodies . The observation of oligodendrocytes and precursors stained with anti-4F prompted us to examine the expression of this semaphorin in brain regions rich in oligodendrocyte progenitor cells . First , cells expressing Sema4F were observed along the optic nerve at embryonic ages Figs . 7A and B , in which this structure contains many migrating OPCs that arrive from the preoptic area Ono et al. , 1997 Spassky et al. , 2002 . Second , we took advantage of a plp-GFP mouse embryo , in which most OPCs express the reporter gene from E16 onwards Spassky et al. , 2001 . Cultures of OPCs derived from optic nerves , in which OPCs express the reporter marker Figs . 7C–E , show co-expression of GFP and Sema4F in most plp-GFP-positive cells . Sema 4F protein was present in the body and processes of OPCs Figs . 7F–H . These results were further confirmed by double-staining of wild-type optic nerve OPCs with anti-4F and anti-Olig2 antibodies , which again showed expression of Sema4F in virtually all Olig2-positive OPCs Figs . 7I–K . To discard the presence of astroglial cells among 4F-positive cells , we also double-stained optic nerve explants from wild-type mice with anti-4F and either anti-GFAP or anti-Vimentin antisera . Our 4F-positive cells were GFAP-negative and Vimentin-negative Suppl . Fig. 2 . Sema4F influences the migration of optic nerve OPCs during development Given the known biological properties of Sema4F and its expres-sion in migrating OPCs , we studied the role of this protein using a classical approach to test OPC migration , namely the culture of optic nerve explants in three-dimensional 3D collagen gels Bribián et al. , 2006 Merchán et al. , 2007 Spassky et al. , 2002 Sugimoto et al. , 2001 . The incubation of optic nerve explants with conditioned media from eSema4F-transfected 293T cells eSema4F corresponds to the extracellular fragment of Sema4F as encoded by a chimeric , truncated cDNA reduced the outward migration of OPCs , compared to control explants cultured with media from mock transfected cells Figs. 8A , B and E . Interestingly , the blockade of endogenous Sema4F activity by incubation with the anti-4F antibody see Experimental methods resulted in increased OPC migration Figs . 8C and E . This effect was not observed with a control antibody Figs. 8A–E . The spec-ificity of Sema4F action was further demonstrated by inhibition of the effect of the anti-4F antiserum through pre-incubation with Sema4F-conditioned media Figs . 8D and E . Noteworthy , while no differences were observed in the maximal distance migrated in the presence of conditioned medium OPCs co-cultured with Mock-transfected conditioned medium 316±13 ? m PCs co-cultured with eSema4F-conditioned medium 293±13 ? m p 0.328 by Student s t-test , a significant difference was detected in the presence of anti-4F antibody IgG diluted 1 300 326±28 ? m anti-4F 478±28 ? m p 0,003 by Student s t-test . In addition , chemotaxis chambers were used to confirm the in-crease in OPC migration in control cultures treated with anti - sema4F as well as the dose-dependent effects of the anti-4F antise-rum . The diagram shown in Fig. 8F shows the rate of OPC migration when the surface Sema4F of these cells was blocked by the antibody . All together , our findings suggest that Sema4F expressed endoge-nously by OPCs regulates the migration of these cells in a paracrine autocrine manner . Sema4F induces the differentiation of rat OPCs To study whether Sema4F affects OPC proliferation or survival , the incorporation of Bromodeoxyuridine BrdU or propidium iodine was analyzed . Neither changes in the survival not shown or proliferation of OPCs were seen in these conditions Fig. 9A , nor were differences in explant size observed between the experimental groups not shown . To examine whether Sema4F affects OPC differentiation , we incu-bated purified OPCs from neonatal rat brain with this protein . The harvesting of OPCs on Sema4F-precoated plates lead to an increase in OPC differentiation , as assessed by the percentage of myelin basic protein MBP -expressing cells Fig. 9B . The graph shows the ratio between MBP-positive versus the total number DAPI-stained of cells . Addition of Sema4F increased the number of MBP-positive OPCs to almost two-fold Figs . 9C–F . This effect was blocked by incu-bation with the sema4F-antibody , which yielded values clearly below to those observed in controls . Again , these experimental data point to a role of endogenously produced Sema4F in oligodendrocyte differentiation . Discussion Sema4F is expressed by neurons , oligodendrocytes and their precursors Most classical studies performed on neural semaphorins report that these molecules are expressed in neurons and that they have functions related to axonal guidance Bagnard et al. , 1998 Falk et al. , 2005 Fenstermaker et al. , 2004 He et al. , 2002 Kantor et al. , 2004 Pasterkamp and Kolodkin , 2003 Pasterkamp et al. , 2003 Skaliora et al. , 1998 Song et al. , 1998 . Because semaphorin expression persists in the adult , this protein has also been linked to learning and plastic-ity reviewed in Pasterkamp and Giger , 2009 as well as to abnormal sprouting upon seizures Barnes et al. , 2003 Holtmaat et al. , 2003 Yang et al. , 2005 . Only recently have studies reported the presence of transmembrane semaphorins in oligodendrocytes Cohen et al. , 2003 Moreau-Fauvarque et al. , 2003 Taniguchi et al. , 2009 and in Schwann cells Parrinello et al. , 2008 . Interestingly , our results indi-cate that Sema4F is expressed in the brain not only by neurons but also by developing and mature oligodendrocytes , and also by OPCs . Our ISH study shows that Sema4F is expressed by neuronal pre-cursors Figs . 1A , B , D , E , CP O , EGL and mature neurons hippocampal populations in Figs . 1C , F mitral cells in K IGL in P . These data are consistent with and extend previous findings on the distribution Sema4F transcripts Encinas et al. , 1999 . Moreover , here we describe that Sema4F is also expressed in pathways such as white matter rich in OPCs Figs . 1B and E , arrow , and in mature oli-godendrocytes Fig. 5H , arrows . In agreement with the ISH data , Sema4F IR in vivo was found not only on neuronal populations but also along the migratory pathways of neuronal aSVZ in Figs . 3H and I RMS in M and oligodendroglial precursors Figs . 3B , * , E , * , O and 5A , ** which travel through areas of white matter and gray mat-ter . Furthermore , our culture experiments demonstrate that Sema4F is expressed by OPCs Figs . 7C–E , F–H and I–K , which confirm our data in vivo . Finally , our co-localization experiments with OPC markers indicated that most Olig2-positive OPCs in the optic nerve Figs . 7I–K and in other brain regions Figs . 6A–F express Sema4F . Of note , Sema4F IR showed a band of almost 80 kDa in WB assays from adult brain lysates Fig. 2F , asterisks . This band is consistent with a shorter form detected in transfected cultures Fig. 2C and could correspond to a truncated form of semaphorin . This diffusible form could afford for a more widespread repulsive effect , as reported for Sema4D in vascular and immune systems Basile et al. , 2007 Chabbert-de Ponnat et al. , 2005 Elhabazi et al. , 2001 . Oligodendrocytes have traditionally been considered mere sup-ports of neurons . This simplified view is starting to change , as a result of the discovery of two electrophysiological types of OPCs in rat CNS white matter namely spiking and non-spiking ones Káradóttir et al. , 2008 . The former shows a spontaneous inward current , medi-ated by voltage-gated Na+ channels , and , importantly , respond to neuronal activity by generating action potentials . Another class 4 semaphorin , Sema4D , appears only in the oligo-dendroglial lineage when expressed in the CNS Moreau-Fauvarque et al. , 2003 Taniguchi et al. , 2009 . In contrast , in the PNS Sema4F is found in Schwann cells as well as in neurons Parrinello et al. , 2008 while in the CNS it is found in neuronal and oligodendoglial lineages alike . This unexpected finding can be explained if we consid-er the complexity of signaling pathways mediated by other sema-phorins , e.g. , in the case of the transmembrane semaphorin Sema6A , its presence both in cis and trans with respect to its receptor modu-lates its repulsive action in neighboring cell types Haklai-Topper et al. , 2010 . Sema4F inhibits OPC migration and stimulates OPC differentiation The migration of OPCs is controlled by a variety of factors , includ-ing PDGF , Netrin-1 and Sonic-Hedgehog De Castro and Bribián , 2005 Merchán et al. , 2007 Rajasekharan , 2008 Richardson et al. , 2006 . Sema4D is expressed by myelinating oligodendrocytes and upregulated upon spinal cord lesion Moreau-Fauvarque et al. , 2003 . Thus Sema4D participates in the inhibition of axonal growth after traumatic lesions . According to our observations , Sema4F is expressed by oligodendrocytes and also by their precursors . We found that this semaphorin inhibits OPC migration without exerting effects on proliferation . This result is specific since anti-4F reversed the inhibition in cultures exposed to Sema4F . Moreover , incubation of explants with anti-4F increased the number of migratory OPCs , thereby suggesting that endogenous Sema4F participates in OPC migration . This also held true in experiments performed in chemotax-is chambers Figs . 8D and F . Other semaphorins , namely Sema3F , which acts as an attractant , and Sema3A , which is an inhibitor of mi-gration in this model De Castro and Bribián , 2005 Spassky et al. , 2001 , have been shown to influence OPC migration along the optic nerve . Sema4F , even if anchored to the plasma membrane , would act in a way similar to diffusible Sema3A , this is to say , contributing to the correct migration of OPCs , ensuring no dispersion or intermin-gling between cells but rather progression along the optic nerve . In our study Sema4F has been shown to contribute to brain OPC differ-entiation , thus this semaphorin would not only organize the migra-tion of precursors but also improve their differentiation into mature , myelinating oligodendrocytes at immediately posterior stages . As the Sema4F receptors are currently unknown , we can not determine whether the above two functions are mediated by distinct or overlap-ping receptor signaling mechanisms . Although the precise mechanism of action of Sema4F in brain OPC migration and differentiation remains to be elucidated , Sema4F should be added to the list of contact-mediated mechanisms with physiological relevance in OPC migration . Like anosmin-1 , tenascin-1 , PSA-NCAM , N-cadherins or ephrins , and in opposition to the effects observed for laminin or fibronectin for review , see de Castro and Bribián , 2005 Richardson et al. , 2006 , Sema4F appears to increase the adhesion of OPCs , thereby limiting their mobility . In contrast to Sema4F , the null-mutation of Sema4D induces an in-crease in the number of oligodendroglial cells , both in control condi-tions and after injury Taniguchi et al. , 2009 . Our data suggest a model in which Sema4F expressed by OPCs contributes to the 50 ? m . outward migration and differentiation of these cells . Accordingly Sema4F may be of relevance in the pathogenesis and or therapy of demyelinating diseases , such as multiple sclerosis and other neuro-logical diseases that show relevant secondary demyelination e.g . traumatic injury , Alzheimer s disease . Experimental methods Animals OF-1 mice kept at the Animal Facilities service of the Unitat d Ex-perimentació Animal de Biologia , University of Barcelona , were used , except the plp-GFP transgenic strain , which was maintained at the Animal Facilities of the Hospital Nacional de Parapléjicos in Toledo . An-imals were kept and handled in compliance with the European Com-munities Council Directive 86 609 EEC . Histology Animals were perfused with 4 % paraformaldehyde in 0.12 M phos-phate buffer pH 7.4 and their brains were infiltrated with sucrose and frozen on dry ice . They were then cut into coronal sections 40 ? m-thick , which were preserved in cryoprotectant solution 30 % glycerol , 30 % ethylenglycol , 40 % 0.1 M PBS and stored at -70 °C until use . ISH studies In situ hybridization ISH was performed on free-floating sec-tions essentially as described Alcántara et al. , 1998 Álvarez-Dolado et al. , 1999 . Riboprobes were labeled with digoxigenin-UTP Roche by in vitro transcription of a cDNA fragment coding for the extracellular half of rat Sema4F Encinas et al. , 1999 . ISH was devel-oped with nitroblue tetrazolium and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indoyl-phosphate NBT and BCIP , Invitrogen . Generation of antibodies A synthetic peptide corresponding to aa 567–587 of rat and mouse Sema 4F was constructed and coupled to KLH for rabbit immunization following standard methods Harlow and Lane , 1988 . The IgG frac-tion of the serum was purified , named anti-4F and checked in our lab-oratory Figs . 2B–D . Transfection COS1 and 293T cells were transfected with expression vectors coding for either full-length or truncated eSema4F , extracellular por-tion consisting of Sema domain plus IgG domain sequence forms of rat Sema4F , coupled to C-terminal Myc epitopes . Lipofectamine plus Invitrogen was used as permeant , and the conditions were those recommended by the manufacturer . Immunochemical procedures Western immunoblotting , immunocytochemistry ICC and im-munoprecipitation IP of transfected cells were performed following standard methods Harlow and Lane , 1988 . Immunohistochemistry was done using peroxidase-linked antibodies and diaminobenzidine DAB , following our regular procedures Alcántara et al. , 1998 Burgaya et al. , 2006 . Electron microscopy studies For pre-embedding immunostaining , adult mice NMRI , n 2 were perfused with 2 % paraformaldehyde and 0.5 % glutaraldehyde in 0.12 M phosphate buffer . Brains were removed from the skull and post-fixed with 2 % paraformaldehyde in 0.12 M phosphate buffer overnight . Vibratome sections were processed for the visualization of SemaW as described above , except that Triton X-100 was omitted from the immuno-reagents and incubations were performed at 4 °C . Labeled sections containing hippocampus , cortex or cerebellum were postfixed with 2 % osmium tetroxide , stained with 2 % uranyl ac-etate and embedded in Araldite . Ultrathin sections were collected onto formvar-coated slot grids and stained with lead citrate . OPC cultures OPC cells were obtained from optic nerve explants and cultured as de-scribed Bribián et al. , 2006 , 2008 Merchán et al. , 2007 Spassky et al. , 2002 . Migration on collagen matrices was performed as in Bribián et al. 2006 , 2008 , replacing the corresponding blocking proteins by eSema4F-enriched COS1-transfected conditioned media , mock-transfected conditioned medium , anti-4F IgG or preimmune IgG . The recombinant protein eSema4F corresponded to a truncated from of rat Sema4F that consists of the Sema plus immunoglobulin domains attached to a C-terminal Myc epitope . OPC differentiation assays OPCs from P1 rat forebrain were harvested by the “shake-off” method , as described previously McCarthy and de Vellis , 1980 . Ap-proximately 100,000 cells per well were seeded onto glass coverslips precoated with poly-D-lysine plus Sema4F-conditioned medium from 293T cells , poly-D-lysine plus control medium , or poly-D-lysine alone , and allowed to differentiate for 3 days . Cells were fixed and immunostained using anti-MBP Millipore and DAPI . The percentage of differentiated cells vs. total number of cells for the three conditions is expressed as the ratio MBP density number of DAPI cells , obtained using the automated fluorescence TIRF microscope Olympus ScanR and a home-made Fuji-based program for the analysis . BrdU proliferation assays The incorporation of BrdU was analyzed using the protocol de-scribed by Spassky et al. 2002 , with slight modifications . BrdU was added to the cultures at a concentration of 50 ? M over 6–24 h . The in-corporation of BrdU was visualized with a monoclonal antibody against BrdU G3G4 , DHSB diluted 1 5 in a solution of 0.2 % gelatin , 0.3 % Triton X-100 , and 5 % FBS in PBS at pH 7.4 . Culture in chemotaxis chambers OPC migration studies were performed in transwell chambers containing polycarbonate membranes pore size 8 ? m Corning Costar and using a modified version of the protocol described by Frost et al. 1996 . The optic chiasm and optic nerves were dissociat-ed in DMEM Invitrogen containing 1.14 U mL papain-Worthington Serlabo , 12 % collagenase Sigma-Aldrich , and 0.48 mg mL cysteine Sigma-Aldrich . The membranes were first coated with poly-L-lysine 10 ? g mL in borate buffer for 1 h at 37 °C , rinsed twice with water and then coated with laminin 10 ? g mL . In each transwell , 5 ? 104 cells were seeded in BS medium in the upper chamber . To block en-dogenous Sema4F in the OPCs , optic nerve cells were pre-incubated 1 h at 37 °C with anti-4F at three dilutions 1 500 , 1 250 and 1 100 . After incubation for 18 h at 37 °C , non-migratory cells on the upper membrane surface were removed with a cotton swab and the migra-tory cells on the lower membrane surface were fixed with 4 % PFA . To identify cells belonging to the oligodendroglial lineage , those that had transmigrated to the lower part of the filter were immunostained for A2B5 clone 105 from ATCC , 1 10 and Olig-2 Chemicon 1 200 Bribián et al. , 2008 . For quantitative analysis , the membranes were observed under a Leica microscope using a 20 ? objective and 10 random fields per well were analyzed in three independent experiments . The number ±SEM of A2B5+ Olig-2+ migrating cells mm2 was recorded for each condition . Supplementary materials related to this article can be found on-line at doi 10.1016 j.mcn.2011.09.003 .

Introduction With the current segment of the US population in middle to late adulthood poised to increase substantially Ortman and Guarneri , 2009 , the prevalence of age-associated neurodegenerative diseases is expected to rise proportionally . Although not all neurodegenerative diseases are fatal , nearly all are a detriment to the quality of life of the affected individuals . Some of the most pronounced examples of this are the retinal degenerative diseases , as they can permanently compromise the vision of individuals affected . The combined preva-lence of the three most common retinal degenerative diseases , age-related macular degeneration AMD , open-angle glaucoma and dia-betic retinopathy DR , exceeds 6.73 % in the U.S. population over 40 years of age Friedman et al. , 2004a , 2004b Kempen et al. , 2004 . The development of a sensitive model for the elucidation of mammalian neurodegenerative mechanisms is an important first step in under-standing age-associated neurodegeneration and developing a frame-work for diagnostic and intervention strategies . The mitochondrial theory of aging remains one of the most prominent hypotheses for the gradual decline of an organism’s fitness with age Paradies et al. , 2011 . Animal models of mito-chondrial dysfunction have been successful in replicating a number of the phenotypic traits associated with normal aging . For example , the PolG mouse demonstrates standard aging markers such as weight loss , reduced subcutaneous fat , alopecia , kyphosis , osteo-porosis , anemia , reduced fertility and heart enlargement Trifunovic et al. , 2004 . In humans , recent studies of the retina have indicated increased mitochondrial DNA damage with increased age and increased AMD severity Karunadharma et al. , 2010 Lin et al. , 2011 . Mitochondria-derived oxidative damage has been associated with late stage retinitis pigmentosa particu-larly in the death of cone photoreceptors Usui et al. , 2009 . Simi-larly , mitochondrial dysfunction has been linked to the degeneration of retinal ganglion cells in Leber’s hereditary optic neuropathy and glaucoma Lee et al. , 2010b . Evidence of mito-chondrial damage is also present in the retinas of both human cases and animal models of diabetic retinopathy Kowluru , 2005 Madsen-Bouterse et al. , 2010 . Leber’s hereditary optic neurop-athy and NARP Neuropathy , Ataxia , and Retinitis Pigmentosa syndrome represent a direct link between single base mutations in the mitochondrial genome and disrupted bioenergetics with retinal degeneration Tatuch and Robinson , 1993 Vilkki et al. , 1989 . Taken together , these findings indicate a potential link between mito-chondrial dysfunction and the progression of retinal diseases . A particular mouse model of mitochondrial dysfunction , the harlequin hq disease mouse XhqXhq or XhqY , demonstrates a premature aging phenotype characterized by late-onset depletion of subcutaneous fat stores , alopecia , ataxia and progressive retinal and cerebellar granule neuron degeneration Benit et al. , 2008 Bronson et al. , 1990 Klein et al. , 2002 Vahsen et al. , 2004 . The harlequin mouse is the result of a proviral insertion into the regu-latory region of intron 1 of the Apoptosis-inducing factor Aif gene , causing a global downregulation of the AIF protein of approxi-mately 80 % Klein et al. , 2002 . AIF is thought to have a role in the assembly of mitochondrial complex I Vahsen et al. , 2004 , a notion that is supported by the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and subsequent mitochondrial degeneration in the neurons of the AIF-deficient harlequin brain El Ghouzzi et al. , 2007 . In terms of the retina , histological phenotyping of the hq disease mouse has identified a number of pathological changes including a gradual loss of photoreceptors , demonstrated by the thinning of the outer nuclear layer ONL , and the presence of stray nuclei in the outer plexiform layer OPL and outer segment layer OSL unpublished data . Interestingly , these two features are also hall-marks of aging in the human eye Curcio et al. , 1993 Gartner and Henkind , 1981 , and may represent a link between mitochondrial dysfunction and typical aging phenotypes . Considering that aging is a risk factor for a number of retinal diseases , the study of the harlequin model may provide some insights into the progression and physiological changes which predispose the retina to a disease state . The onset of detectable retinal degeneration in the harlequin disease mouse occurs between 5 weeks and 3 months , with severe vision loss at approximately 10 months of age Klein et al. , 2002 . This accelerated rate of decline provides a narrow window to observe the molecular mechanisms of neurodegeneration . The harlequin carrier mouse XhqX has both a mutated and a normal copy of the Aif gene , of which , only one is expressed in a given cell due to random X-inactivation . This heterozygote for the harlequin mutation presents the possibility of a mitochondrial dysfunction model with similar , but less severe symptoms in comparison to the hq disease mouse . The major objective of this study was to establish a timeline of retinal degeneration for the hq heterozygote and to evaluate its use as a framework for the study of molecular mech-anisms of aging . 2 . Materials and methods 2.1 . Animals Female mice heterozygous for the harlequin mutation XhqX B6CBACaAw-J A-Pcdc8hq J Jackson Laboratories , Bar Harbour , ME were selected in a cohort study of 3 , 11 , and 15 months of age . Mouse genotypes were confirmed using a tri-primer PCR as previously described Klein et al. , 2002 . Cohorts of six XhqX and six wild type WT mice were selected for each age group for in vivo retinal imaging and retinal function assays . Sample sizes of three XhqX and three WT were selected for post mortem retinal cell counts at all three ages . Additionally , the 11-month-old post mortem samples were examined for elevated superoxide anion levels . All protocols were approved by The Canadian Council on Animal Care . The mice were fed a standard diet PMI Foods , St. Louis , MO and water ad libitum . Housing conditions included a light dark cycle of 14 10 , and a consistent temperature of 21 1 C with relative humidity of 44e66 % . 2.2 . Dark adaptation and anesthesia Mouse body mass was determined prior to in vivo testing in each cohort and was used to determine appropriate dose of anesthesia . Animals were dark adapted for 3 h prior to consecutive ERG and OCT testing . Dark adaptation time was based on data regarding rhodopsin regeneration following light exposure Lee et al. , 2010a , and was kept consistent throughout . Animals were anaesthetized through intraperitoneal injection of 100 mg kg ketamine hydro-chloride and 5 mg kg xylazine drug mixture . To improve survival rate of the animals under anesthesia , subcutaneous 0.01 mg kg atropine and intramuscular 1 mg kg antisedan were administered to reduce the risk of bradycardia and heart failure as a result of ketamine and xylazine administration . Anesthesia and in vivo testing were performed in a dark room with red safety lights . 2.3 . Electroretinography ERG The mouse pupils were dilated by using drops of Diophenyl-TÒ Sandoz Canada Inc. , Boucherville , QC on the corneal surface for approximately 10 min . Drops of AlcaineÒ solution Alcon Canada Inc. , Mississauga , ON were also applied topically to the eyes to prevent discomfort due to contact with the ERG electrodes . Gold loop electrodes Grass Technologies , West Warwick , RI were placed securely on the cornea using clamp stands to prevent elec-trode movement . A small amount of Tear-GelÒ Novartis Pharma-ceuticals Canada Inc. , Mississauga , ON was applied to the electrode to lubricate contact with the eye and to keep eyes hydrated . A gold reference electrode was placed in the mouth of the animal , and a grounding wire was inserted subcutaneously into the tail of the animal . Impedances of the corneal and ground electrodes were measured at 30 Hz prior to the run to ensure high signal to noise ratios . ERG measurement protocols were started if impedance values were less than 5000 Ohms . Electrical responses of the retina were elicited using 10 light stimulus conditions applied by a Col-ordome Stimulator Diagnosys , Lowell , MA . Light intensity for the 10 stimuli were 0.0025 , 0.006 , 0.016 , 0.04 , 0.1 , 0.25 , 0.63 , 4 , 10 , and 25 cd*s m2 , respectively , provided by a Xenon flash of 5 ms to 2 ms duration . The dimmest light intensity steps were applied first to ensure that scotopic conditions were maintained . Four results were obtained for each stimulus , with 10 s between each flash , and their average was used in subsequent data analysis . The sampling frequency was 1000 Hz . The a-wave was identified as the most negative point occurring 10e40 ms after the flash , while the b-wave was the most positive value occurring 40e120 ms after the flash . Amplitudes of the a-and b-waves for each mouse were averaged across both eyes prior to analysis . 2.4 . Optical coherence tomography OCT Optical coherence tomography OCT was performed using a VisanteÔ Instrument Carl Zeiss Canada Ltd , Toronto , ON . The instrument was adapted for mice through the use of a mechanical platform which could be used to steady and orient the mouse eye . The high resolution scan was centered at the vertex of the mouse eye prior to image capture . Anterior portions of the eyes were examined for opacity in the lens and cornea to look for possible confounders of ERG measurements . The posterior segments of the eyes were also scanned for abnormalities of the retina and pig-mented epithelium . 2.5 . Tissue harvest Mice were euthanized via CO2 inhalation and tissues were immediately harvested , embedded in optimal cutting temperature media and flash frozen on liquid nitrogen-cooled platform . These tissues were then cryopreserved at 80 C. Right eyes used for retinal cell counts were harvested and fixed in Fekete solution 3.5 % formaldehyde , 60 % ethanol , 4.3 % glacial acetic acid . After fixation for a minimum 48 h , eyes were processed using a Leica ASP300 automated tissue processor Leica Microsystems , Houston , TX which performed serial 1 h ethanol dehydrations with increasing concentrations from 70 to 100 % , as well as three subsequent 1 h xylene clearing treatments . These automated steps took 12e16 h and were performed overnight . 2.6 . H E retinal cell counts and layer thickness determinations Paraffin-embedded eyes were sectioned to a thickness of 10 mm . Two retinal cross-sections per animal were hematoxylin and eosin-stained and digital images were taken at three different locations in the central retina using 200 magnification . Of these three central retina images , two were taken 300 mm from the optic disc one on each side , and one was taken of the retina adjacent the optic disc to the medial side . Cell layer nuclear counts were performed by drawing three lines per image for both the INL and the ONL , and counting the number of nuclei touching each line . All sections and images were examined for neovascularization , retinal pigmented epithelium disruption , neutrophil invasion , and structural disrup-tion of the retina . Measurements were performed by two separate scorers blinded to sample identifiers . Nuclear displacement into the outer segment layer was scored in H E-stained sections for the peripheral and central retina of age-matched female harlequin carrier XhqX and wild type mice at 3,11 and 15 months of age n ? 3 . The peripheral regions were defined by 1000 mm regions from the ora serrata to points in the segment layer on the posterior aspect of the retina . The central region was defined by a 1000 mm region with ends equidistant from the ends of the two peripheral line segments . Displaced nuclei in the segment layer of the retina were only counted when the nucleus was wholly discontinuous with the border between the outer ONL and segment layer of the retina . 2.7 . Cryosectioning Cryopreserved left eyes were cryosectioned to a 10 mm thickness using a Leica CM350 Cryostat Leica Microsystems , Houston , TX . Retinal cross-sections transverse sections through both the pupil and optic disc were briefly stored at 20 C until stained . 2.8 . Dihydroethidium DHE staining Cryosectioned left eyes were treated with 50 mL of 5 mM dihy-droethidium DHE SigmaeAldrich Canada Inc. , Oakville , ON in dimethyl-sulphoxide DMSO BDH Inc. Toronto , ON and incubated in a humidified chamber at 37 C for 30 min . DMSO-treated cryosections served as controls for levels of autofluorescence in the samples . Specificity of superoxide anion detection was assessed using a Bovine Superoxide Dismutase SOD SigmaeAldrich Canada Inc. , Oakville , ON pre-treatment 10 min with 30 mL of 1000 U mL . Levels of superoxide anions were detected using an Arcturus VeritasÔ Micro-dissection System and the green fluorescence filter allowing the detection of the DHE emission wavelength of 590 nm . The fluores-cence lamp gain was standardized for all images and analyses . Images were captured at 200 magnification at three locations , two at the peripheral retina and one at the central retina , across three tissue sections for each DHE treatment and control . Intensity of fluorescence was determined at four non-overlapping regions per image for the ganglion cell layer GCL , the INL and the ONL . Fluorescence quanti-tation was performed using ImageJ analysis software National Insti-tute of Health , Bethesda , MD . Analysis was performed separately by two scorers blinded to animal cohort and identifiers . 2.9 . Statistical analysis Age-specific comparisons of genotypic differences were per-formed by One-way ANOVA . Whole genotype comparisons for all age groups , as well as multi-parameter analyses , were performed using Multi-way ANOVAs . Age-specific genotype comparisons across all steps of ERG were performed using Repeated Measures ANOVA . All data were analyzed using the Statistics Package for Social Sciences SPSS version 16.0 IBM Corporation , Somers , NY . 3 . Results 3.1 . Body mass of the harlequin carrier mouse is lower than wild type in middle adulthood The body mass of harlequin carrier mice was equivalent to wild type controls at 3 months of age , however , the average body mass of harlequin carrier mice was significantly lower than wild type at 11 3.2 . Electroretinography ERG shows deficits in the retinal function of hq carrier mice Examination of ERG waveforms indicated no significant differ-ence in a-wave and b-wave latencies between hq carrier and wild type mice Fig. 1AeC . Analysis of the ERG a-wave amplitude , a measure of photoreceptor electrochemical response van Norren and Valeton , 1979 , revealed a modest , but non-statistically significant weakening of the a-wave amplitude in 3-and 11-month-old hq carrier mice Fig. 2A and B . At 15 months of age , a-wave amplitude of hq carrier mice deteriorated substantially in comparison to wild type mice p 0.001 Fig. 2C . At 3 months of age , examination of the b-wave amplitude , a measure of the retinal electrochemical response through the ON bipolar cells Wurziger et al. , 2001 , revealed a significant decrease in hq carrier mouse b-wave amplitude when compared to the wild type mice p 0.05 Fig. 2D . In the 11-month cohort , the hq carrier b-wave was rela-tively unchanged from the 3-month cohort , however , it was still significantly lower than wild type controls p 0.05 Fig. 2E . The largest genotypic difference in the b-wave was observed at 15 months of age . At higher light intensities , the b-wave amplitude reached a plateau of approximately 225 mV in hq carrier mice , while the wild type b-wave upper limit was approximately 375 mV , rep-resenting a substantial decrease in retinal function p 0.001 Fig. 2F . Left and right eyes were not significantly different for both a-wave and b-wave amplitudes . High resolution scanning of cornea , lens , and retina revealed no obvious anterior obstructions or confounders to the imaging of retinal structure Fig. 3AeD . Furthermore , no qualitative evidence was found of microphthalmia , enophthalmy , angle closure , or cornea and lens opacity which could account for the reduced visual function in any of the cohorts studied . 3.4 . Hematoxylin and eosin retinal cell counts support late retinal thinning in hq carrier mice General histological evaluation of retinal sections indicated no significant pathology or thinning in hq carrier mice at 3 months of age Fig. 4A and B . A subtle disruption of the nuclear layers of the retina , defined mainly by the dispersion of nuclei into the outer plexiform and outer segment layers , was observed in 11-and 15-month-old hq carrier mice Fig. 4CeF . Although nuclear layer boundaries did not visibly change , there was an apparent reduction in nuclear density in the INL and ONL of the hq carrier mice at 15 months of age Fig. 4E and F . INL and ONL cell counts in the central retina revealed few differences in 3-and 11-month-old mice . The only statistically relevant difference observed in these ages was that the INL of 3-month-old hq carrier mice had 9 % more neurons than wild type controls p 0.05 Fig. 5A . In the 15-month-old hq carrier cohort , central INL and ONL thicknesses had respective deficits of 16.4 % and 26 % when compared to wild type controls p 0.001 Fig. 5A and B . Quantification of aberrant nuclei in the OSL indicated no difference between genotypes at 3 months of age . However , harlequin carrier mice had , on average , 5-and 12-fold more displaced nuclei in 11-and 15-month-old cohorts , respec-tively p 0.001 Fig. 6 . Age was a statistically relevant factor for both INL and ONL assessments across both genotypes p 0.001 . Retinal nuclear counts by different scorers were not significantly different in any of the regions examined . SOD substantially quenched DHE fluorescence , demon-strating specificity of DHE for superoxide Fig. 7 . DHE fluores-cence in the layers of the retina was consistently higher in the 11-month-old hq carrier eyes than in age-matched wild type mice . Central and peripheral ONL showed 24 % and 19 % eleva-tions , respectively , in hq carrier DHE fluorescence when compared to the wild type p 0.001 Fig. 8A . Whole retinal analysis of the INL and the GCL found respective 8.5 % and 7.5 % increases in hq carrier DHE fluorescence p 0.01 and p 0.01 Fig. 8B . Regional DHE fluorescence measures were not signifi-cantly different between scorers . 4 . Discussion Contrary to previous notions that XhqX mouse phenotypes were indistinguishable from wild type Klein et al. , 2002 , evidence is presented that the harlequin heterozygote has a moderate retinal disease phenotype beginning with mild vision deficits prior to late-onset photoreceptor degeneration . Previous studies of harlequin disease mice determined that body mass was significantly reduced Benit et al. , 2008 , a feature which is present in many mitochondrial disorders Munnich and Rustin , 2001 . Similarly , the hq carrier mice also showed a significant reduction in body mass , albeit at much later timepoints than the hq disease mice . This evidence , combined with the increase in ROS indicated by dihydroethidium staining , support the notion that hq carrier mice are also affected by a similar mitochondrial disorder . The most surprising result , however , related to presence of retinal function deficits prior to the onset of retinal neuron degeneration . Electroretinography of hq carrier mice revealed an early deficit detectable at 3 months of age of b-wave amplitude , corresponding to a reduced bipolar neuron response to a light stimulus . This early reduction in retinal function was not observed at the level of the photoreceptors , as a-wave amplitude and ONL thickness were only significantly different between hq carrier and wild type mice at 15 months of age . The combination of these electroretinography markers could suggest that hq carrier retinal function is compromised downstream of the photoreceptors in the ONL , pointing to pathology either at the photoreceptor-bipolar cell synapse , or within the bipolar cells themselves . Based on the histology of the hq carrier retina , it seems unlikely that this reduction in b-wave amplitude is related to cell death , making it more likely the result of neurite degeneration or synaptic remod-eling . The possibility of neurite degeneration is also supported by a previous study that identified degeneration of neurites in the hq disease brain prior to significant levels of neuron apoptosis El Ghouzzi et al. , 2007 . Synaptic or neurochemical remodeling has been identified as a response to metabolic or physical stress within the retina Chua et al. , 2009 Fletcher and Kalloniatis , 1996 . In this scenario , glutamate receptors are redistributed in secondary neurons and glutamate trafficking is disrupted , presumably due to physical or metabolic insult Chua et al. , 2009 Napper and Kalloniatis , 1999 . Disruption of glutamate metabolism trafficking results in the accumulation of glutamate in Müller glia and deprivation of glutamate in the photoreceptors Bui et al. , 2009 . It was previously shown that the disruption of glutamate dynamics results in a decrease in b-wave amplitude independent of cell death Bui et al. , 2009 , a phenotypic combination similar to what was observed in the hq carrier retina . The neurochemical remodeling hypothesis may also have some relevance to the presence of nuclei in the outer segment layer . The altered metabolism of glutamate in Müller glia has previously coincided with hypertrophy in both ischemic and retinal dystrophy models Hartig et al. , 1995 Lewis et al. , 1999 . Similarly , Müller glia have been shown to become hypertrophic even in the early stages of a mild retinal degeneration model Iandiev et al. , 2006 . Müller cell hypertrophy is integral to the formation of glial columns , and is thought to facilitate cell migration within the retina Jones and Marc , 2005 . It is therefore conceivable that Müller cell hypertrophy could be responsible for the isolated migration of neurons within the retina . The histology of the hq carrier retina supports this hypothesis through the increased presence of nuclei within the outer segment layer and focal encroachment of the ONL and INL into the outer plexiform layer Fig. 6 . Coincidentally , Müller cell hypertrophy and outer segment nuclear migration are both hallmarks of the aging retina Gartner and Henkind , 1981 Ramirez et al. , 2001 , perhaps indi-cating a more substantial relationship between metabolism , Müller cells , and retinal function . Although it may be premature to assert that mitochondrial dysfunction in the XhqX mouse is directly responsible for synaptic disruption and subsequent vision deficits , the XhqX model warrants further exploration to determine possible mechanistic links . Initial deficits of retinal function prior to neuron loss could represent a new biomarker for mitochondrial health and aging-associated retinal disease risk . Recent results involving early functional deficits prior to the onset of diabetic retinopathy , a disease involving metabolic disruption and mitochondrial dysfunction , lend support to this hypothesis Lecleire-Collet et al. , 2011 . However , further investigation of this model , including apoptosis assays and glial immunohistochemistry , as well as the verification of this trend in other models of premature aging and late-onset retinal degeneration must be performed to validate this proposed mechanism of mitochondrial dysfunction-induced b-wave deficits . Currently , the neurochemical dynamics of the retina are relatively understudied . The examination of the neurochemical and synaptic alterations in relation to aging or other mitochondrial stresses may yield useful insights into aging-associated retinal disease . Because of its late and slow onset of retinal degeneration , the harlequin carrier is uniquely suited to model potential neurochemical changes , making it an interesting topic of future investigations .

Diabetes 60 2710–2719 , 2011 Ustrong ncoupling protein 2 UCP2 was discovered based on sequence homology to UCP1 1 , a well-studied UCP involved in thermogenesis . UCP1 induces a proton leak in the inner mitochondrial membrane , which dramatically dissipates the proton mo-tive force PMF , consequently halting the driving force for ATP production and dissipating energy as heat 2 . Despite homology to UCP1 , the precise physiological function of UCP2 remains unclear 3 . A mild metabolic uncoupling function whereby UCP2 facilitates a proton leak , particu-larly when activated by superoxide or lipid peroxidation products , has been demonstrated 4–6 however , evidence exists that disputes this classical metabolic uncoupling function 7–9 . A growing body of evidence now suggests that UCP2 contributes to the control of mitochondrial-derived reactive oxygen species ROS production 3,4,10,11 . This may provide an important mechanism to fine-tune mitochondria-generated ROS signals that regulate cell function and or to prevent oxidative stress , a condition that results from chronic ROS accumulation and ultimately leads to oxidative damage and cytotoxicity 12,13 . To combat oxidative stress , b-cells express relatively high amounts of the superoxide dismutase SOD family of antioxidants 50 % of that found in liver , which con-vert superoxide into hydrogen peroxide H2O2 , yet b-cells have relatively low expression of H2O2-scavenging enzymes 1 % of that found in liver 14 . Some argue that this makes b-cells particularly susceptible to oxidative stress and cyto-toxicity , whereas others argue that this creates an environ-ment highly sensitive to ROS-related signaling . Since ROS production is directly coupled to the metabolic rate in most tissues 15 , ROS could provide a vital regulatory link be-tween glucose metabolism and insulin secretion 16–18 , and UCP2 may be an important regulator of such ROS-related signals . Since its discovery , numerous studies have demonstrated a negative link between UCP2 and b-cell function 1 . UCP2 expression is upregulated in response to chronic high glu-cose 19,20 and fatty acid exposure 19,21–23 and is thus associated with obesity , hyperglycemia , and type 2 diabetes . More recently , mutations in the gene expressing UCP2 have been directly associated with congenital hyperinsulinemia in humans , further demonstrating this link between UCP2 and insulin secretion 24 . Approximately a decade ago , whole-body UCP2 knockout UCP2KO mice were created on a mixed 129 SVJxC57BL 6 background 25 to explore UCP2 function in the b-cell . UCP2KO mice have reduced blood glucose levels , improved glucose tolerance , higher islet ATP content , enhanced glucose-stimulated insulin se-cretion GSIS 25 , and increased intracellular ROS levels in islet cells 26,27 compared to control mice . Similar re-sults have been demonstrated in rat insulinoma b-like cells INS-1E , where acute knockdown of UCP2 also increased intracellular ROS and enhanced GSIS 18 . However , this view of UCP2 as a negative regulator of GSIS has not been consistently supported . Backcrossing UCP2KO mice for several generations onto highly congenic background strains resulted in increased oxidative stress and impaired GSIS 28 . Although the precise contribution of genetic background to these disparate effects of UCP2 on GSIS is currently un-known and is an issue that requires cautious interpretation of results , it seems that UCP2 commonly regulates ROS in all strains , further highlighting the importance of UCP2 in ROS regulation . Until now , whole-body UCP2KO mouse models have been widely used to study the role of UCP2 in b-cell func-tion 23,25–28 . However , these models can be problematic because UCP2 deletion in other tissues and cell types , in-cluding brain and other islet cells i.e. , a-cells 25,29,30 , can affect glucose-sensing and glucose homeostasis 31,32 . To elucidate the function of UCP2 in the b-cell , we have created and characterized a novel b-cell–specific UCP2KO mouse UCP2BKO . Here , we show that UCP2 does not behave as a true uncoupler in the b-cell , but rather con-tributes to the regulation of b-cell ROS , which in turn regu-lates GSIS . In addition , we suggest that b-cell UCP2 regulates intraislet ROS signals that can target and regulate the function of neighboring glucagon-secreting a-cells . RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Islet dispersion , immunohistochemistry , and confocal microscopy . Islets Mitochondrial membrane potential and islet ATP content . Mitochondrial Static hormone secretion and total hormone content . Eight to 20 islets RESULTS Knockdown of UCP2 transcript and protein in pan - creatic b-cells . UCP2 expression was reduced by 75 % in UCP2BKO compared with RIPCre islets using the Cre-lox recombination system Fig. 1C . UCP2 expression in the a-cell and other islet cell types contributes to detectable UCP2 in whole islets 29 . Therefore , islets were dispersed and subjected to immunohistochemistry to confirm deletion in b-cells . UCP2 protein red was detectable in , 10 % of insulin-positive cells green in UCP2BKO dispersed islets , suggesting 90 % deletion in b-cells Fig. 1E , two left pan-els . Insulin-positive cells green were also immunostained for Cre protein red , which was found localized to the nuclei of UCP2BKO b-cells only Fig. 1E , two right panels and not in floxed control b-cells data not shown . In ad-dition , UCP2 deletion was examined in various tissues using standard PCR . No deletion in spleen was observed how-ever , low but detectable deletion was seen in hypothalami from UCP2BKO mice Fig. 1D . No UCP2 deletion was observed in any RIPCre tissue Fig. 1D . UCP2 deficiency in b-cells mildly increases glucose-induced DCm without impact on mitochondrial coupling or islet ATP content . To determine the contribution of UCP2 to mitochondrial uncoupling , the total OCR and OCR in the presence of saturating amounts of oligomycin were measured , the latter representing the uncoupled fraction of respiration . UCP2BKO and RIPCre islets exhib-ited similar uncoupled OCRs Fig. 2C under both basal and glucose-stimulated conditions , suggesting that UCP2 defi-ciency in the b-cell does not increase mitochondrial cou-pling . Interestingly , UCP2BKO islets showed higher total OCR compared with RIPCre islets Fig. 2D , with both genotypes experiencing approximately 1.5-fold increased OCR upon stimulation with 20 mmol L glucose Fig. 2E . No difference in islet size was observed between the two groups Supplementary Fig. 5 . UCP2BKO and RIPCre islets have similar amounts of ATP , both in low and high glucose conditions Fig. 2F , which is reflective of these two genotypes having similar rates of uncoupled respiration . Basally 2.8 mmol L glu-cose , RIPCre and UCP2BKO b-cells also have similar DCm , further supporting the notion that UCP2 does not contribute to classical proton leak in b-cells Fig. 2A and B however , in the presence of 20 mmol L glucose , UCP2BKO b-cells undergo very mild , yet significantly increased mitochondrial membrane hyperpolarization compared with RIPCre b-cells Fig. 2A and B , which is potentially a consequence of the greater respiratory flux observed in these cells . UCP2 deficiency in b-cells raises intracellular ROS levels . To further investigate the function of UCP2 in b-cells , a cell-permeable fluorescent H2O2 indicator CM-H2-DCFDA , was used to measure intracellular ROS levels . Similar to that shown in islets from whole-body KO mice 26–28 , UCP2BKO isolated islets Fig. 3A and b-cells Fig. 3B displayed significantly higher intracellular H2O2 levels compared with RIPCre control mice , demonstrating that UCP2 plays a role in the regulation of intracellular ROS levels in the b-cell . Subsequently , basal intracellular ROS levels were correlated with the expression of several ROS-responsive genes by quantitative PCR Fig. 3C . In UCP2BKO islets , upregulated expression of the H2O2-scavenging glutathione peroxidase 1 Gpx1 and Gpx4 genes was observed Fig. 3C . In addition , Gpx2 , Gpx3 , and catalase Cat all showed a trend toward higher gene expression in UCP2BKO islets , but these values did not reach statistical significance . Interestingly , the expression of heme oxygenase-1 HO-1 , which is induced by oxi-dative stress and confers cytoprotection to limit tissue damage 36 , was unchanged in UCP2BKO islets Fig. 3C . These findings suggest that long-term elevation of ROS in UCP2BKO islets induces changes in signal transduction pathways that lead to altered antioxidant gene expres-sion however , these ROS levels are not high enough to induce oxidative stress damage that requires cytoprotection by HO-1 . UCP2 deficiency in b-cells enhances GSIS in vitro in a ROS-dependent manner . To investigate the effect of b-cell–specific UCP2 deletion on insulin secretion , GSIS was measured in RIPCre and UCP2BKO isolated islets using an islet perifusion system Fig. 4A and B . At 2.8 mmol L glu-cose , RIPCre and UCP2BKO secreted similar amounts of insulin . At 11 mmol L glucose , insulin secretion was more rapid and robust in the UCP2BKO islets Fig. 4B . Similarly , insulin secretion was greater in UCP2BKO islets compared with RIPCre controls at 16.7 mmol L glucose Fig. 4C , dem-onstrating that UCP2 deficiency in b-cells enhances GSIS but has no effect on insulin secretion at low glucose con-centrations . In addition , preincubation of human islets with genipin , a known UCP2 inhibitor 37 , resulted in significantly enhanced GSIS Fig. 4F , further proof that acute inhibition of UCP2 enhances GSIS . To our knowledge , this is the first demonstration that the role of UCP2 in mouse islets is shared with human islets . Recent studies suggest that exposure to moderately elevated ROS stimulates insulin secretion in vitro 16–18 , therefore the effect of manipulating ROS levels on insulin secretion was investigated . Preincubation of UCP2BKO islets with 0.2 mmol L NAC , which promotes H2O2 scav-enging by increasing glutathione synthesis , reduced intra-cellular H2O2 levels to a level similar to RIPCre islets Fig. 3A and consequently reduced GSIS Fig. 4E . Conversely , pretreatment of RIPCre islets with 5 mmol L DEM , which promotes ROS formation through interference with gluta-thione synthesis , boosted intracellular H2O2 levels Fig. 3A and resulted in escalated GSIS Fig. 4D . Therefore , ele-vated intracellular ROS is at least one contributing factor to the elevated GSIS observed in UCP2-deficient b-cells . UCP2 deficiency in b-cells is associated with greater a-cell area , increased islet glucagon content , and aber-rantly increased glucose-induced glucagon secretion . Despite having enhanced GSIS in vitro Fig. 4 , oral glu-cose tolerance tests OGTTs revealed that UCP2BKO mice are glucose-intolerant compared with RIPCre mice Fig. 5A . No differences in body weight , fasting plasma insulin , and glucagon levels or in daily fasting blood glucose were observed between the two genotypes Supplementary Fig. 2 . Insulin tolerance tests ITTs revealed no differences in insulin sensitivity Fig. 5B . Plasma insulin levels during the OGTT were also similar in both genotypes Fig. 5C how-ever , plasma glucagon levels measured 10 min after gavage just before the peak of blood glucose were suppressed in RIPCre mice but were aberrantly increased in UCP2BKO mice Fig. 5D . Since islets are anatomically complex micro-organs consisting of a heterogeneous population of endo-crine cells all of which can significantly affect glucose homeostasis , the effect of b-cell UCP2-deficiency on the function and morphology of a-cells was investigated . No difference in the number of islets per pancreatic area was observed Fig. 6A . Insulin-positive areas in UCP2BKO and RIPCre pancreata Fig. 6B were similar , suggesting equal b-cell masses . Conversely , UCP2BKO pancreata had a greater glucagon-positive area compared with RIPCre islets Fig. 6C , indicative of increased a-cell mass . Total islet insulin content Fig. 7B was similar between the two genotypes however , glucagon content was significantly elevated in UCP2BKO islets Fig. 7A . Overall , UCP2 de-ficiency in b-cells induced increased a-cell mass and total islet glucagon content . Furthermore , the effect of ROS on glucagon secretion in vitro was investigated under high glucose 16.7 mmol L conditions when glucagon secretion is normally blunted . Untreated UCP2BKO islets secrete approximately 4.5-fold more glucagon than RIPCre islets in high glucose con-ditions Fig. 7C , consistent with our in vivo measure-ments . Preincubation of UCP2BKO islets with antioxidant NAC reduced both intracellular ROS levels Fig. 3A and glucagon secretion Fig. 7C . Similarly , pretreatment of RIPCre islets with pro-oxidant DEM increased in-tracellular ROS levels Fig. 3A and glucagon secretion Fig. 7C . Overall , higher intracellular ROS levels are associated with and appear to promote aberrant glucagon secretion when islets are exposed to a high glucose concentration . This suggests that UCP2 deficiency in the b-cell promotes glucagon secretion in a ROS-dependent manner , and therefore , b-cell UCP2 plays a role in the regulation of intraislet ROS signals that regulate a-cell function and morphology . DISCUSSION UCP2 function in the b-cell . Using a novel b-cell–specific UCP2KO mouse model , we have been able to shed some light on a long-debated issue regarding UCP2 function in primary b-cells . UCP2 deficiency in the b-cell is associated with higher rates of total respiration and greater glucose-induced DCm , without increased mitochondrial coupling efficiency or altered ATP levels . Therefore , by definition , UCP2 does not function as a classical uncoupling protein in primary b-cells . Significant evidence exists for a role of UCP2 in the reg-ulation of ROS production 18,20,27,28 , which has only been tested in UCP2KO models and clonal cell lines . In-tracellular ROS is significantly elevated in UCP2BKO islets and b-cells , strengthening this connection between ROS regulation and UCP2 . Given that mitochondrial coupling is unchanged , increased ROS formation in UCP2BKO islets is not the result of reduced proton leak in the inner mito-chondrial membrane . Rather , UCP2BKO b-cells display mildly increased glucose-induced DCm , which is one potential consequence of greater OCR in these islets and can lend to greater mitochondrial ROS formation . Mitochondrial ROS formation occurs very efficiently at higher DCm 38 . Thus , even a mild increase in mitochondrial membrane hy-perpolarization can significantly promote mitochondrial ROS formation . Alternatively , other undiscovered or unconfirmed transport functions of UCP2 in the b-cell may indirectly contribute to the regulation of mitochondrial ROS formation and or the control of glucose-induced mitochondrial mem-brane hyperpolarization . Elevated intracellular H2O2 levels in UCP2BKO islets consequently correlated with enhanced GSIS , confirming that ROS are important signaling molecules that regulate GSIS 16–18 . Although we did not investigate the specific targets of ROS signaling that control GSIS in this study , we did demonstrate that ROS alone is not sufficient to promote insulin secretion in the absence of high glucose . That is , basal insulin secretion was not higher in UCP2BKO islets that had higher intracellular ROS moreover , pro-oxidant treatment of RIPCre islets did not stimulate insulin secretion when incubated in low glucose . These findings conflict those of Pi et al. 2007 17 , who demonstrated that ROS alone sufficiently promoted insulin secretion independently of glucose concentration in INS-1E cells and isolated mouse islets however , in a separate set of experiments , they demonstrated that inhibition of mitochondrial ATP pro-duction by mitochondrial electron transport chain inhib-itors , which also increase ROS , subsequently inhibited GSIS . This suggests that without ATP stimulation , GSIS can not be amplified , despite increased ROS levels 17 . A similar phenomenon was demonstrated in the 2009 study of Leloup et al. 16 . Therefore , ROS alone is not a suitable “trigger” for insulin secretion , but is more likely an “ampli-fying” signal 39 . The ATP-dependent triggering pathway of insulin secretion has been well characterized however , the amplifying pathway of GSIS is less well defined . It is , at least in part , thought to result from increased efficacy of calcium on the exocytotic machinery 39 . Interestingly , it has been shown that calcium mobilization during GSIS is ROS-dependent 16,17 . b-Cell UCP2 and the a-cell . Previous studies on whole-body UCP2KO mice revealed improved glucose tolerance 25 or no change in glucose tolerance 28 after an OGTT . Unexpectedly , UCP2BKO mice were glucose-intolerant . Both genotypes had similar insulin sensitivities and plasma insulin levels after glucose challenge , which suggests that impaired glucose tolerance in the UCP2BKO mouse is not due to impaired glucose clearance but to rather some other dysfunction of glucose homeostasis . Importantly , islets are anatomically complex and sophisticated microorgans consisting of a heterogeneous population of endocrine cells , all of which can significantly affect glucose homeo-stasis . For this reason , the effect of b-cell UCP2-deficiency on the function and morphology of pancreatic a-cells was investigated . UCP2 deletion in b-cells resulted in greater islet gluca-gon content and atypically increased glucagon secretion both in vitro and in vivo under high glucose conditions . This finding differs dramatically from the whole-body UCP2KO mice , which showed impaired glucagon secretion 25 . Unlike in the UCP2KO animals , UCP2BKO a-cells retain UCP2 expression , which may be a contributing factor to the heightened glucagon secretion observed un-der high glucose conditions , although this remains to be proven . Importantly , the abnormal glucagon secretion ob-served under high glucose conditions in UCP2BKO islets was ROS-dependent . Evidently , ROS generated in the b-cell as a consequence of UCP2 deletion potentially functions as an intraislet signal that regulates a-cell function . As such , b-cell UCP2 is important not only in the regulation of ROS signals that regulate GSIS and b-cell function but also in the control of intraislet ROS signals that contribute to the regulation of a-cell function . If we relate this finding back to the observed glucose intolerance of the UCP2BKO mice , aberrant glucagon secretion under high glucose conditions could provide one potential explanation for this phenotype however , it is important to acknowledge that several other potentially complex factors could also contribute to the glucose intolerant phenotype of these mice . Recently , a small population of hypothalamic neurons were shown to express Cre recombinase under the rat insulin promoter in transgenic mice 40 . UCP2 is expressed in the hypothalamus , yielding the potential for UCP2 deletion in the brain . Although the identity and function of these RIPCre-expressing hypothalamic neurons remains unknown , we can not deny their potential contribution to glucose homeostasis . Future studies , including measurement of hepatic gluconeogenesis and or peripheral insulin sensitivity by the clamp protocol , could provide interesting insight into the glucose-intolerant phenotype of the UCP2BKO mouse . In addition to altered a-cell function , a-cell mass was greater in UCP2BKO pancreata , which could be a direct consequence of higher islet ROS concentrations , because moderate increases in ROS have been shown to directly stimulate cell proliferation in many cell types 41 . Inter-estingly , increasing concentrations of insulin one conse-quence of UCP2 deficiency in b-cells can also increase a-cell proliferation through the insulin-receptor signaling pathway 42 . Additionally , ROS have been shown to fur-ther promote insulin action via ROS-dependent inactivation of protein tyrosine phosphatases 43 . We can therefore speculate that greater insulin secretion and elevated ROS levels , at least in part , contribute to the increased a-cell mass seen in the UCP2BKO pancreata . Despite the well-established paracrine inhibitory effect of insulin on glucagon secretion 44,45 , we observed a ROS-dependent escalation of glucagon secretion in the presence of elevated GSIS , suggesting that ROS-mediated regulation of glucagon secretion occurs independently of insulin action . Although the mechanism s and targets of ROS-mediated regulation of a-cell function are largely unknown , this type of regulation of a-cell function may be a significant player in the development of hyperglycemia and type 2 diabetes . Clinical studies have revealed that lack of suppression of postprandial glucagon secretion signifi-cantly contributes to hyperglycemia observed in type 2 FIG. 7 . Total glucagon content and glucagon secretion are augmented in UCP2BKO islets . A Total glucagon content of isolated RIPCre and UCP2BKO islets . Data for n 6 . *P 0.05 .

The error bars show the SEM . diabetic patients 46–48 , conditions that are also associ-ated with elevated levels of ROS 20,49 . Our findings using the UCP2BKO mouse model have revealed that UCP2 does not behave as a classical un-coupler in the pancreatic b-cell . It appears that at least one function of b-cell UCP2 is to control intracellular and intraislet ROS signals , which in turn regulate b-and a-cell function , respectively however , the precise contribution of UCP2 to regulation of both intracellular and intraislet ROS signals under various physiologically relevant conditions is unclear . We know that ROS levels increase dramati-cally during chronic hyperglycemia 20,49 , hyperlipidemia 23,50 , and in diabetic mouse models 20,49 , and that UCP2 activity increases under similar conditions 19,20 , potentially to combat oxidative stress and stave-off cyto-toxicity however , UCP2 function may differ dramatically in a healthy cell and may have a more subtle role in the reg-ulation of GSIS-amplifying ROS signals . Therefore , it will be imperative to clearly identify the conditions of UCP2 acti-vation and deactivation and contribution to ROS signaling in both healthy and diseased states to fully elucidate UCP2 function in b-cells .

21998399	RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS—Using the WldS mice , Gpancreatic lucose homeostasis is largely maintained by the b-cells , which secrete insulin in re-sponse to elevated ATP levels as a result of glucose metabolism 1 . b-Cell dysfunction often leads to diabetes 2,3 . However , the underlying mechanisms involved in the preservation of b-cell function remain to be fully understood . Silent information regulator 1 SIRT1 , an NAD-dependent protein deacetylase , regulates various biological processes including glucose homeostasis 4–6 . SIRT1 controls the gluconeogenic glycolytic pathways in the liver 7 and im-proves insulin sensitivity under insulin-resistant conditions in C2C12 myotubes 8 . In b-cells , SIRT1 promotes the expression of NeuroD and MafA , two factors essential for the transcription of insulin , by deacetylating and activating Foxo1 to protect against oxidative stress 9 . Moreover , glucose-stimulated insulin secretion GSIS in islets of SIRT1 knockout mice is blunted 10 , whereas GSIS is enhanced in b-cell–specific SIRT1-overexpressing mice 11 . Nevertheless , how SIRT1 is regulated to modulate insulin secretion and improve glucose homeostasis remains to be further explored . Wallerian degeneration is an experimental model of axon degeneration . Remarkably , this degeneration is dramatically slowed in Wallerian degeneration slow WldS mice , a spontaneous mutant mouse strain 12 . The protective function is attributed to a chimeric gene resulting from an 85 kb tandem triplication in chromosome 4 13 . The chimeric gene , WldS , encodes an N-terminal 70 amino acids fragment of ubiquitination factor E4B Ube4b fused to nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferase 1 NMNAT1 , a crucial enzyme for NAD biosynthesis 14,15 . The NAD biosynthesis activity is pivotal for the neuronal protective function of WldS , which maintains the cellular NAD levels in a steady state and prevents NAD decline in injured axons 16,17 . It has been implicated that NAD biosynthesis is also involved in b-cell function . The activity of SIRT1 on GSIS in b-cell–specific SIRT1-overexpressing mice decreases with age , which probably is the result of a decline in systemic NAD biosynthesis 18 . Haplodeficiency of nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase NAMPT in female mice , but not male , causes the decrease of NAD biosynthesis and defect of GSIS , and the extracellular form of NAMPT seems to be the main causation 19 . Thus , whether the enhancement of NAD biosynthesis mediated by WldS increases GSIS and improves glucose homeostasis remains to be elucidated . In this study , we found that WldS mice showed improved glucose homeostasis even under high-fat HF diet and streptozotocin STZ -challenged states and that WldS regulated insulin transcription and secretion dependent on SIRT1 . Moreover , WldS associated with SIRT1 and increased NAD levels in the pancreas , which led to the enhanced SIRT1 activity to downregulate uncoupling protein 2 UCP2 and upregulate ATP levels . Thus enhancing NAD bio-synthesis in b-cells to increase SIRT1 activity might be a potential therapeutic approach for diabetes .

Oxygen consumption , carbon dioxide RESULTS WldS protein is highly expressed in pancreas and has no effect on the morphology of islets . We found WldS was expressed in various tissues , and highly expressed in pancreas including insulin-producing b-cells Fig. 1A–C and Supplementary Fig. 1A . The presence of WldS did not change the mRNA levels of Ube4b or NMNAT1 Sup-plementary Fig. 1B and C or the NMNAT1 protein levels Supplementary Fig. 1D–H . The WldS mRNA level exceeded that of NMNAT1 by more than 20-fold in the pancreas Supplementary Fig. 1I . The islet area and islet cell density were unaltered by WldS Fig. 1D–F . These data show that the high expression of WldS has no significant effect on the morphology of islets . WldS mice show high levels of serum insulin , improved glucose tolerance , normal insulin clearance rate , and normal insulin sensitivity . Next we investigated whether WldS had any effect on b-cell function . Serum insulin levels in 13-week-old WldS mice were higher than those of wild-type in both fed and fasted animals Fig. 2A . Fed blood glucose levels were similar in wild-type and WldS mice , but fasted and refed blood glucose levels in WldS mice were significantly lower Fig. 2B . Similar effects of WldS on fed serum insulin and fasted blood glucose levels were also observed in mice with a mixed genetic background C57 129 ICR , and the effects in heterozygous WldS mice were weaker than the homozygous ones Supplementary Fig. 2A and B . Furthermore , homeostasis model of b-cell function of 13-week-old WldS mice was significantly upregulated Fig. 2C , and HOMA-IR was similar Fig. 2D . WldS mice showed markedly improved glucose tolerance Fig. 2E and F , and these effects were dependent on the gene dose of WldS and decreased with age Supplementary Fig. 2C–E . Serum insulin levels of WldS mice during the glucose tolerance test were significantly higher than those of wild-type Fig . 2G and H , suggesting the improved b-cell function in WldS mice . Insulin clearance rate was not FIG . 4 . WldS mice are resistant to STZ-induced hyperglycemia . A and B Blood glucose levels and diabetes incidence of WldS mice n 11 were lower than those of wild-type WT mice n 14 after MLDS treatment at the indicated times . For diabetes incidence , P 0.001 by Log-rank test . C Immunostaining of pancreatic sections from wild-type and WldS mice using anti-insulin antibody 35 days after vehicle VEH or MLDS treatment . Hematoxylin staining was performed after immunostaining . D The percentage of insulin positive area in islets of WldS mice was affected by WldS when monitored by in vivo insulin clear-ance assay and fasting C-peptide-to-insulin molar ratio Fig. 2I and J , which indicated that the elevated serum insulin levels in WldS mice were not a result of altered insulin clearance . Insulin tolerance test confirmed that WldS and wild-type mice had similar insulin sensitivity as measured by HOMA-IR Fig. 2K and L . Insulin-induced phosphory-lation of insulin receptor and AKT in muscle and liver was also indistinguishable between WldS and wild-type mice Fig. 2M-R . In addition , the protein level of SIRT1 , an im-portant regulator in hepatic metabolism , and NAD levels in the liver were similar in wild-type and WldS mice Supple-mentary Fig. 3A–C . These data show that WldS improves b-cell function and glucose homeostasis but does not affect insulin sensitivity . WldS mice show improved glucose tolerance when fed HF diet . The body weight and fat mass were moderately increased in WldS mice compared with wild-type when fed chow , and the differences were more prominent when fed HF diet Fig. 3A and B . As expected , HF diet caused in-creased fat content and decreased lean content in both groups Fig. 3C and D . Interestingly , when compared with wild-type mice , the fat content was increased in WldS mice fed HF diet Fig. 3C . Serum total cholesterol , HDL-cholesterol , and LDL-cholesterol levels were elevated in both groups fed HF diet for 12 weeks , and no differences were observed between wild-type and WldS mice Fig. 3E–G . In WldS mice fed with either chow or HF diet , fasting blood glucose levels were decreased , and serum insulin levels but not insulin sensitivity was remarkably increased , compared with corresponding wild-type controls Fig. 3H–K . Notably , wild-type mice fed HF diet exhibited impaired glucose tolerance , and this was strikingly improved in WldS mice Fig. 3L and M . The islet area of WldS and wild-type mice fed HF diet was enlarged to a similar extent Fig. 3N and O . These data suggest that WldS alleviates HF diet-induced glucose intolerance by enhancing insulin production . WldS ameliorates STZ-induced hyperglycemia in mice . To study the direct effect of WldS on b-cells , mice were administered STZ , which selectively destroys b-cells 32 . After MLDS treatment , blood glucose levels in both groups increased gradually , but were much lower in WldS mice than those in wild-type Fig . 4A . The diabetes incidence in WldS mice was only about 18 % compared with 100 % in wild-type 21 days after MLDS treatment , and these trends were maintained thereafter for at least 14 days Fig. 4B . After MLDS treatment , WldS mice preserved more insulin producing b-cells and remarkably higher serum insulin levels than wild-type Fig . 4C–E . These data show that WldS protects against pancreatic b-cell failure and hyper-glycemia induced by MLDS . WldS enhances insulin transcription and secretion . We next investigated how WldS enhanced insulin pro-duction . As shown in Fig. 5A and B , islets isolated from WldS mice released more insulin under basal , glucose - , or KCl-stimulated conditions than those from wild-type when normalized to either the protein concentration or the insulin content . WldS mainly localized in the nuclear of islet b-cells , when treated with glucose or KCl Supplementary Fig. 4 . higher than that of wild-type corresponding to C.

A high-quality digital representation of this figure is available in the online issue . The effect of WldS on the upregulation of insulin content in islets was not significant Fig. 5C , which might be because of the very high insulin levels in normal islets . Insulin expression was increased in MIN6 cells stably expressing EGFP-fused WldS or WldS with Myc-tag , whereas the increase was attenuated in cells stably expressing WldS-H112A or WldS-F116S , in which the NAD biosynthesis activity of WldS was abolished Fig. 5D-F . The protein levels of WldS and WldS NMNAT1 protein ratio in the cell lines were even higher than those in the islets of WldS mice Supplementary Fig. 5 . Moreover , increased NAD biosynthesis activity was observed in the pancreas of WldS mice Fig. 5G . In addition , WldS dramatically upregulated insulin mRNA levels , which also depended on its enzyme activity Fig. 5H and I . Further studies showed WldS acti-vated insulin promoter in a dose-dependent manner , which also required its enzyme activity Fig. 5J and K . NMNAT1 , the COOH-terminal of WldS protein , also activated insulin promoter as WldS , whereas its enzyme-dead mutant NMNAT1-F28S could not Fig . 5K . These data suggest that the FIG. 6 .

A high-quality color representation of this figure is available in the online issue . upregulated NMNAT enzyme activity contributes to the enhanced insulin transcription and secretion induced by WldS . SIRT1 is required for the enhanced transcription , secretion of insulin , and the resistance to STZ-induced hyperglycemia caused by WldS . We next investigated whether the effect of WldS on insulin production and glu-cose homeostasis depended on SIRT1 . Sirtinol , an inhibitor of SIRT1 , attenuated WldS-induced activation of insulin promoter Fig. 6A . Insulin transcription and secretion in islets and serum insulin levels of SIRT12 2 WldS+ + mice were significantly decreased compared with SIRT1+ + WldS+ + mice Fig. 6B–D . The blood glucose levels of SIRT12 2 WldS+ + mice were similar with SIRT1+ + WldS+ + mice no matter whether mice were fed , fasted , or challenged with glu-cose Supplementary Fig. 6A–C , which might be as a re-sult of the enhanced insulin sensitivity of SIRT1 null mice 10 . The body weight and fat content of SIRT12 2 WldS+ + mice were decreased compared with SIRT1+ + WldS+ + mice Fig. 6E and F , probably resulting from their in-creased energy expenditure Supplementary Fig. 6D–H . After MLDS treatment , the blood glucose levels of SIRT12 2 WldS+ + and SIRT1+ + WldS2 2 mice increased much faster than those of SIRT1+ + WldS+ + mice Fig. 6G . And the di-abetes incidence of SIRT12 2 WldS+ + mice was much higher than that of SIRT1+ + WldS+ + mice Fig. 6H . Therefore , SIRT1 is necessary for the enhancement of insulin tran-scription , secretion , and the resistance to STZ-induced hyperglycemia caused by WldS . WldS downregulates UCP2 expression and upregulates ATP levels through SIRT1 . Next , we explored how WldS exerts its function through SIRT1 . NMNAT1 was reported to interact with and regulate the activity of SIRT1 in breast cancer cells 33 , suggesting WldS containing the full-length NMNAT1 has similar effects . As expected , we found WldS colocalized and coimmunoprecipitated with SIRT1 Fig. 7A–C . Besides that , both NAD and its pre-cursor NMN were upregulated in the pancreas of WldS mice Fig. 7D–F , suggesting the activity of SIRT1 was enhanced . SIRT1 has been reported to enhance GSIS by down-regulation of UCP2 and upregulation of ATP 10,11 . Similarly , we found WldS downregulated UCP2 promoter activity like SIRT1 Fig. 7G and repressed UCP2 protein and mRNA levels dependent on its NAD biosynthesis activity Fig. 7C and H . The effect of WldS on UCP2 mRNA and protein levels also depended on SIRT1 Fig. 7I–K . Furthermore , ATP levels were also significantly increased at both low and high glucose concentrations in islets of WldS mice compared with wild-type Fig . 7L , and this function again depended on SIRT1 Fig. 7M . DISCUSSION Over the past decade , numerous studies have focused on the axon protective function of WldS and its potential ap-plication in neuronal diseases 16 . The effect of WldS in nonneuronal cells would also probably shed light on the understanding and treating of other diseases . However , there were few reports concerning this . In this study , we demonstrate that WldS enhances insulin transcription and secretion as well as improves glucose homeostasis , and SIRT1 is required in these processes . It is well established that b-cells show a variety of simi-larities with neuronal cells 34 , which implicates that WldS , a protein functional in neuronal cells , may also function in b-cells . As expected , we found that WldS was highly expressed in the pancreas including insulin-producing b-cells Fig. 1A–C and enhanced insulin transcription and secretion Fig. 5 . In addition , WldS mice exhibited in-creased serum insulin levels Figs . 2A and 3I , even though their blood glucose levels were normal in the fed state Fig. 2B . Similarly , SIRT4 knockout mice , for example , also show high insulin and normal fed blood glucose levels 35 , which might be as a result of the existence of factors that increase blood glucose levels , including glucagon and gluconeogenesis . These factors acted as a counterbalance to neutralize the glucose-lowering effect of insulin and thus to maintain the blood glucose at a stable level . WldS mice showed improved glucose tolerance Fig. 2E . Simi-larly , b-cell–specific SIRT1-overexpressing mice also show improved glucose tolerance as a result of enhanced GSIS 11 . Compatibly , we found that SIRT1 was required for the function of WldS in insulin secretion Fig. 6C and D . Increased cellular NAD levels have been shown to enhance SIRT1 activity 6 . Consistently , we found NAD and its precursor NMN were upregulated in the pancreas of WldS mice Fig. 7D–F , and WldS enhanced insulin transcrip-tion dependent on its NAD biosynthesis activity Fig. 5 . These data suggest that NAD plays a key role in SIRT1-mediated enhancement of GSIS induced by WldS . It is noteworthy that NMNAT2 , an enzyme catalyzing NAD biosynthesis , is highly expressed in the islets of Langerhans 36 , which also suggests the importance of NAD biosynthesis in in-sulin secretion . It has been reported that UCP2 knockout mice show improved GSIS 37 , and b-cell–specific SIRT1-overexpressing mice show improved GSIS by decreasing UCP2 expression and elevating ATP levels 11 . Analo-gously , we found WldS downregulated UCP2 expression and upregulated ATP levels via SIRT1 Fig. 7 , which further confirmed that WldS regulates insulin secretion through a SIRT1-dependent pathway . Usually , b-cells will secrete more insulin to overcome the reduced insulin sensitivity , which is often related with obesity 38 . When their compensate mechanisms are im-paired , type 2 diabetes occurs 1 . WldS mice show increased serum insulin levels no matter whether mice were fed chow or HF diet without altering insulin sensitivity Fig. 3I-K , which indicates enhanced b-cell function in WldS . Further-more , when fed HF diet , the glucose tolerance of WldS mice was strikingly improved Fig. 3L and M . Similarly , ghrelin knockout mice or GPR40 b-cell–specific transgenic mice also show increased insulin secretary capacity without al-tering insulin sensitivity and improved glucose tolerance when fed HF diet 39,40 . In addition , WldS promoted in-sulin secretion and downregulated UCP2 via SIRT1 Figs . 6C and 7I–K , which consisted with the studies that both b-cell–specific SIRT1-overexpressing mice and UCP2 knock-out mice showed enhanced insulin secretion and resistance to HF diet–induced glucose intolerance 18,41 . Taken together , our findings suggest that enhanced insulin sec-retary capacity by upregulating NAD biosynthesis activity in b-cells would be beneficial to overcome reduced insulin sensitivity induced by HF diet . Type 1 diabetes is a chronic autoimmune disease , during which b-cells are selectively destroyed 2 . MLDS has been extensively used to generate b-cell destruction to mimic type 1 diabetes 25 . In this study , we found that MLDS– induced hyperglycemia was alleviated in WldS mice , which also demonstrated increased serum insulin levels Fig. 4 . It is noteworthy that UCP2 knockout mice , which showed enhanced insulin secretory capacity , had accelerated hy-perglycemia after MLDS treatment as a result of stronger inflammation 24 . In this scenario , WldS mice were supe-rior to UCP2 knockout mice , probably resulting from some different underlying mechanisms . It has been reported that WldS shows protective effects in some neurodegener-ative disease models 12,16 . It is likely that amelioration of MLDS-induced hyperglycemia and attenuation of neu-rodegenerative diseases by WldS could share some com-mon underlying mechanisms . Additionally , the resistance to MLDS-induced hyperglycemia was abolished in WldS mice with SIRT1 deficiency Fig. 6G and H , which is consistent with the report that intra-arterial targeted islet-specific expression of SIRT1 protects b-cells from STZ-induced apoptosis in mice 42 . Thereby , the SIRT1-dependent WldS pathway is a potential target not only to enhance insulin secretory capacity , but also to protect against b-cell failure . In this study , our results demonstrate that WldS com-bines an insulinotropic effect with protection against b-cell failure and suggest that upregulation of the NAD bio-synthesis to increase SIRT1 activity in b-cells will be ben-eficial for diabetes .
