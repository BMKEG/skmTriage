This morphological change in the cells and their rapid disposal are distinct from necrosis , in which cells swell , the plasma membranes are ruptured , and the cellular contents are believed to be released . The signal transduction involved in apoptotic cell death has been intensively studied4,5 and shown to proceed by two major pathways , an extrinsic and an intrinsic one . In the extrinsic pathway , signals from death receptors , such as Fas and TNF receptor , activate an initiator caspase , caspase-8 , that activates downstream effector caspases , mainly cas-pase-3 , leading to the cleavage of more than 300 cellular proteins.6,7 One of the caspase-3 substrates is the inhibitor of caspase-activated DNase CAD , and its cleavage by caspase-3 inactivates the ability to associate with CAD , allowing CAD to cause the fragmentation of chromosomal DNA into nucleosomal units.8 In the intrinsic pathway , death signals cause the release of cytochrome c from mitochon-dria through �BH3-only� proteins of the Bcl-2 family.9,10 The cytochrome c binds to Apaf-1 and activates caspase-9 , which leads to the activation of caspase-3 and CAD , resulting in the cleavage of cellular substrates and the fragmentation of chromosomal DNA . Apoptotic cells that die by either the intrinsic or the extrinsic pathway expose phosphatidyl-serine on their surface.11 Macrophages and immature dendritic cells recognize the phosphatidylserine and rapidly engulf the apoptotic cells.12 The engulfed dead cells are trans-ferred to lysosomes , where all their components are degraded . The role of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway in programmed cell death has been studied by establishing mice that lack genes involved in apoptotic signal transduction.13�17 The results obtained with these knockout mice have not always been consistent among groups . For example , Yoshida et al.14 and Kuida et al.13 reported that Apaf-1 and caspase-9 are indispensable for the cell death induced by cytotoxic agents or g-radiation in various tissues , whereas Marsden et al.18 reported that lymphocytes undergo apoptosis without Apaf-1 or caspase-9 on cytokine deprivation . Furthermore , except for craniofacial abnormalities and the hyperproliferation of neuronal cells , Apaf-1-deficient mice are apparently normal , especially in the C57BL 6 background , 19 suggesting the presence of a back-up system for the Apaf-1-mediated apoptosis in mouse development . Because dying cells are swiftly engulfed and degraded by macrophages , the detection of apoptotic cells in animals is not an easy task . DNase II is responsible for digesting the DNA of apoptotic cells after macrophages engulf them , and many macrophages carrying engulfed DNA are present in DNase II-deficient embryos.20�22 Here , we used DNase II-deficient mice to detect the programmed cell death that occurs during mouse development , and found that Apaf-1 seems to be dispensable for this process . In the thymus of Apaf-1 embryos at E14.5 , caspases were activated in an Apaf-1-independent manner . In most other tissues , cells died by an Apaf-1-independent nonapoptotic mechanism , and were engulfed by macrophages . These results indicate that Apaf-1-independent systems , with or without caspase activation , function as back-up systems for the programmed cell death in mammalian development . Results Apaf-1-dependent programmed cell death in mouse embryos at E11.5 . When we used the TUNEL staining to detect apoptotic cells in E11.5 wild-type mouse embryos , it yielded barely detectable signals data not shown . A mutation of nuc-1 , a homologue of DNase II , enhances the TUNEL positivity in C. elegans.23 Similarly , the mouse DNase II embryos showed very strong TUNEL signals Figure 1a , which is due to the accumulation of DNA fragmented by CAD.24 TUNEL-positive spots were frequent in several regions , such as the diencephalon at the cerebrum , the lamina terminalis , somites , and mesonephric ducts . Observations at higher magnification showed TUNEL positivity in these regions was much stronger in the DNase II than the wild-type embryos . The TUNEL-positive spots in the DNase II embryos were clustered into foci that were strongly DAPI positive Figure 1b . The foci were located inside F4 80-positive macrophages , suggesting that they were the DNA of engulfed apoptotic cells . The engulfment of corpses in C. elegans requires the activation of caspase a mutation in Ced-3 or Ced-4 , homologues of caspase and Apaf-1 , respectively , prevents the engulfment of cell corpses.25 Accordingly , a null mutation of Apaf-1 blocked the generation of TUNEL-positive foci Figure 1a and b , indicating that the apoptotic cell death and engulfment of dead cells in the E11.5 mouse embryos were apparently Apaf-1 dependent . Apaf-1-independent programmed cell death in mouse embryos . Many TUNEL-positive foci were observed throughout the DNase II embryos at E14.5 as well data not shown . DNase II embryos produce IFNb which is lethal , but the lethality can be rescued by a deficiency of IFN type I receptor.26 To exclude the possible cell death caused by IFNb , we carried out the TUNEL staining with DNase II IFN-IR embryos . Many TUNEL-positive foci still could be detected in various tissues of DNase II IFN-IR embryos Figure 2a data not shown , suggesting that the death of the cells in DNase II embryos was intrinsic to mouse embryo-genesis , and not due to the secondary effect by IFNb . The null mutation of Apaf-1 blocked the generation of TUNEL-positive foci in most tissues of the E14.5 DNase II IFN-IR embryos . For example , many TUNEL-positive foci were present at the interdigits of the hind paw of DNase II IFN-IR embryos , and activated caspase-3 could be detected in this region Figure 2a and b . The deficiency of Apaf-1 prevented both the caspase activation and the appearance of TUNEL-positive foci . Probably due to the inhibition of apoptotic cell death , the formation of interdigits was retarded in the Apaf-1 DNase II IFN-IR embryos compared with Apaf-1 ? ? DNase II IFN-IR embryos , as reported for Apaf-1-null mice.14 At E17.5 , fewer DAPI-positive foci were detected in the Apaf-1 ? ? DNase II IFN-IR embryos than at E14.5 , as seen , for example , in the interdigits Figure 2c , which have completely formed by E17.5 . In contrast , the interdigits of the Apaf-1 DNase II IFN-IR embryos carried more DAPI - positive foci at E17.5 than at E14.5 , and these DAPI-positive materials were located within F4 80-positive macrophages Figure 2d . Electron microscopy showed that the DNA accumulated in the macrophages at the interdigits of the E17.5 Apaf-1 ? ? DNase II IFN-IR embryos is fragmen-ted , whereas the DNA in the Apaf-1 DNase II IFN-IR embryos was apparently intact Figure 2e . The active caspase-3 could be detected in the interdigits of Apaf-1 ? ? but not Apaf-1 embryos data not shown . These results suggested that in late embryogenesis , the cells in the inter-digits could die in an Apaf-1-independent manner , and the dead cells were engulfed by macrophages . Apaf-1-independent nonapoptotic cell death . At the ventral ectodermal ridge of the tail in mouse embryos , many cells undergo programmed cell death , which was detected as DAPI-positive foci in the DNase II IFN-IR embryos at E14.5 Figure 3a and b . In the Apaf-1 ? ? embryos , the DNA that accumulated in the ridge was TUNEL positive , and many processed caspase-3-positive cells could be detected in this region . On the other hand , the DNA that accumulated in the Apaf-1 embryos was TUNEL negative , and processed caspase-3-positive cells were hardly detec-table . Because the DAPI-positive foci were relatively closely clustered in the ventral ectodermal ridge of the tail Figure 3c , we analyzed this region by electron micro-scopy . As shown in Figure 3d , many unengulfed , nonapo-ptotic dying cells were detected in the E14.5 Apaf-1 embryos . That is , the unengulfed dying cells showed mottled chromatin condensation , nuclear membrane detachment and rupture , and dilated mitochondria . Approximately 5 % of the cells in the tail ridge of E14.5 Apaf-1 embryos had the nonapoptotic morphology Figure 3e , but apoptotic dying cells were hardly detectable . Nonapoptotic dead cells in the tail ridge of Apaf-1 ? ? embryos were rare , about 1 % , but cells with apoptotic characteristics , such as condensed and fragmented nuclei , were relatively abundant 1.72 % . These results indicated that the cells in the tail ridge underwent nonapoptotic cell death in the absence of Apaf-1 , and that these dead cells were engulfed by macrophages . Apaf-1-independent apoptosis in the thymus . Many TUNEL-and DAPI-positive foci were observed in the thymus of DNase II IFN-IR embryos at E14.5 Figure 4a . In contrast to most other tissues , such as the interdigits and tails at this stage of embryogenesis , the TUNEL-positive foci were present in the Apaf-1 thymus as well , where processed caspase-3 was also detected . Electron microscopy indicated that the DAPI-positive material in the E14.5 thymus was inside macrophages , and the DNA that accumulated in the macrophages was frag-mented in both the Apaf-1 ? ? and the Apaf-1 thymuses Figure 4b . These results indicated that the thymocytes at E14.5 could activate caspase-3 and CAD using an Apaf-1-independent mechanism . The E17.5 Apaf-1 thymus also carried DAPI-positive foci Figure 4c . But , in contrast to the E14.5 Apaf-1 thymus , the TUNEL reactivity of the foci in the E17.5 Apaf-1 DNase II IFN-IR thymus was very weak , and processed caspase-3 was barely detected . Staining with F4 80 indicated that the DAPI-positive foci in the Apaf-1 thymus were inside macrophages Figure 4c , and the electron microscopy showed that the DNA that accumulated in the macrophages was intact Figure 4d . These properties of the E17.5 Apaf-1 thymus were different from those of the E14.5 thymus , but Apaf-1-independent caspase activation . To examine whether thymocytes can undergo caspase-dependent apoptotic cell death in the absence of Apaf-1 , we prepared thymocytes from the wild-type and Apaf-1 E14.5 embryos . They were treated with two different apoptosis inducers , etoposide and staurosporine , and the caspase-3 activity in the cell lysates was determined with a fluorescent substrate , similar with those found in other tissues interdigits , and tail at E14.5 and 17.5 . Ac-DEVD-AMC . As shown in Figure 5a , a strong caspase-3 activity about 5600 U could be detected in the cell lysates from the wild-type but not Apaf-1-deficient thymocytes treated with 50 mM etoposide . The cell lysates from the thymocytes treated with 10 mM staurosporine also showed a caspase-3-activity about 1300 U . Different from the treat-ment with etoposide , the cell lysates from the staurosporine-treated Apaf-1 thymocytes carried a significant caspase-3 activity 500 U . The active caspase-3 is often released from the cells into supernatant.27 In fact , the supernatant from staurosporine-treated Apaf-1 ? ? and Apaf-1 thymocytes carried a high caspase-3 activity 10 000�15 000 U . Conver-sely , the treatment with etoposide produced the caspase-3 activity in the supernatant with Apaf-1 ? ? thymocytes , but not with Apaf-1 thymocytes . These results indicated that etoposide could activate caspase-3 in E14.5 thymocytes in an Apaf-1-dependent manner , whereas Apaf-1 is dispen-sable for the staurosporine-induced activation of caspase-3 . Similar results were obtained with E17.5 thymocytes , that is , staurosporine but not etoposide activated caspase-3 in E17.5 Apaf-1 thymocytes as efficiently as Apaf-1 ? ? thymocytes , although the extent of the activated caspase-3 per cell is significantly lower than that found with E14.5 thymocytes Figure 5a . To confirm the caspase-3 activity detected with Ac-DEVD-AMC is due to the processed caspase-3 , we analyzed the cell lysates using western blot method with the antibody against caspase-3 . As shown in Figure 5b , the lysates from the staurosporine-treated Apaf-1 ? ? and Apaf-1 thymocytes showed a 17 kDa band for the processed caspase-3 . This band was detected in the lysates from the etoposide-treated Apaf-1 ? ? but not Apaf-1 thymocytes , and its intensity correlated with the caspase-3 activity detected Figure 5a . When the culture supernatants from staurosporine-or etopo-side-treated E17.5 Apaf-1 ? ? thymocytes were immuno-precipitated with the antibody against processed caspase-3 , they showed the 17 kDa band by western blot with the antibody against the processed caspase-3 Figure 5b . However , the 17 kDa band was not detected in the immuno-precipitate of the etoposide-treated E17.5 Apaf-1 thymo-cytes , which agrees with the little caspase-3 activity in the supernatant Figure 5a . In the intrinsic apoptotic pathway , Apaf-1 works as a scaffold to activate caspase-9 , which induces processing of procaspase-3.10 To examine an involvement of caspase-9 in the Apaf-1-independent activation of caspase-3 , we carried out western blot analysis with anticaspase-9 . As shown in Figure 5c , the 37 kDa processed caspase-9 could be detected in the lysates from the staurosporine-treated Apaf-1 ? ? as well as Apaf-1 thymocytes . In contrast , the processing of procaspase-9 in the etoposide-treated thymocytes was observed in the Apaf-1 ? ? thymocytes , but not in the Apaf-1 thymocytes . These results indicate that stauros-porine but not etoposide can activate caspase-9 in the absence of Apaf-1 . Discussion Many cells die during mammalian development . However , as the dead cells are swiftly engulfed by macrophages for degradation , it is difficult to detect them . For example , more than 90 % of thymocytes undergo programmed cell death during the development of the thymus . But , only a small percentage of the cells can be stained by TUNEL at a given time point.28 Many neurons also undergo programmed cell death in the brain , but the reported number differs greatly among researchers , 29�31 probably due to the difficulty in detecting dead cells that are quickly eliminated . Here , we used DNase II-null mice to detect the programmed cell death that occurs during mouse embryogenesis . The DNase II-null mice carried in various tissues macrophages that contained undigested DNA , suggesting that cells died surrounding the macrophages and were engulfed . Although it is difficult to determine which and how many cells died , the DNase II mice were nonetheless useful for localizing the regions where programmed cell death occurs . The macrophages carrying undigested DNA eventually disappeared , probably because those with a heavy load of DNA could not survive , suggesting that the DNase II mice can also be used to estimate the time when programmed cell death takes place . In fact , we have been able to show that specific layers of cerebral neurons undergo programmed cell death at specific stages of mouse embryogenesis AN , KK , and SN , manuscript in preparation . Crossing the Apaf-1 mice with DNase II mice , we showed that most of the apoptotic cell death during mouse embryonic development takes place through an Apaf-1-dependent pathway . This agrees with previous reports that deletion of the Apaf-1 or caspase-9 gene blocks apoptotic cell death in the brain , and ear.13,14 Similarly , the apoptotic cell death in E17.5 thymus was also blocked by deficiency of Apaf-1 , indicating that the negative and positive selections at CD4 ? CD8 ? thymocytes proceed in an Apaf-1-dependent pathway . In contrast , very surprisingly , we found that caspase-3 could be activated without Apaf-1 in the E14.5 thymus , in which most thymocytes are CD4 CD8 .32 Furthermore , staurosporine but not etoposide activated caspase-3 in the fetal thymocytes without Apaf-1 . Etopo-side and staurosporine are inhibitors for topoisomerase and kinase C , respectively , and both of them have been reported to activate caspase-3 by releasing cytochrome c from mitochondria.33,34 Thus , no requirement of Apaf-1 in the staurosporine-induced activation of caspase-3 in the fetal thymocytes was unexpected . This result suggests that staurosporine can activate caspase-3 in thymocytes through a pathway that does not use cytochrome c , and this pathway may be similar to that used in the Apaf-1-independent apoptotic cell death of E14.5 thymocytes . We observed that caspase-3 can be activated without Apaf-1 not only in the fetal thymus but also in the fetal liver AN , KK , and SN , unpublished observation , which may be consistent with reports that hemopoietic cells reconstituted with fetal liver cells can activate caspase without Apaf-1.18,35,36 To understand this apoptosis , it will be necessary to determine how and which caspases are activated by staurosporine without Apaf-1 . Even when the caspase was not activated in Apaf-1-deficient mice , macrophages carrying undigested DNA were present in the embryo , in particular at the late stage of development , indicating that cells could die without Apaf-1 , and were engulfed by macrophages . This agrees with the previous report showing that myeloid cells die without Apaf-1 or caspase-9.37 Several Apaf-1-or caspase-independent cell death processes have been proposed , including autophagic cell death and necrosis.38 As reported for the interdigits of Apaf-1 embryos , 39 we found in the ectodermal ridge of the tails of Apaf-1 mice many cells exhibiting mottled chroma-tin condensation , nuclear membrane detachment and rupture , and dilated mitochondria . Whereas , no cells with the char-acteristics of autophagy double-membraned vacuoles , indicating that the cells probably died because of necrosis . One possible cause of nonapoptotic cell death is that the stimuli that induce programmed cell death in mouse embryo-genesis cause cytochrome c to be released , inactivating mitochondrial function , which leads to cell death.37 The mice lacking both Bak and Bax that are essential for the release of cytochrome c40 show the persistence of interdigital webs , 17 which suggests that Bak Bax can cause necrotic cell death by releasing cytochrome c . It will be interesting to examine whether the null mutation of Bax and Bak can prevent the generation of macrophages carrying undigested DNA in DNase II-null embryos . In Apaf-1 embryos , dead cells were found in macro-phages , indicating that the nonapoptotic dead cells were recognized by macrophages for engulfment . In C. elegans , a common set of genes mediates the removal of both apoptotic and necrotic cell corpses.41 Conversely , different mechan-isms have been proposed to clear apoptotic and necrotic cells in mammalian system.42 Apoptotic cells expose phosphati-dylserine , which is recognized by specific receptors or opsonins for engulfment.12 Because necrotic cells also expose phosphatidylserine at a late stage , 38 it is possible that similar receptors or opsonins mediate the engulfment of apoptotic and necrotic cells . The complement system is another candidate for the engulfment of late apoptotic or necrotic cells.43 It will be interesting to study the engulfment of necrotic cells by crossing the Apaf-1 mice with mice deficient in the engulfment of apoptotic or necrotic cells.44,45 Unengulfed apoptotic cells are difficult to find in mouse tissues . However , we frequently detected unengulfed dead cells with nonapoptotic morphology in the Apaf-1 embryos , suggesting that the engulfment of nonapoptotic dead cells is inefficient compared with that of apoptotic cells . This may allow noxious materials to be released from dying cells . In addition , the engulfment of necrotic cells but not apoptotic ones is known to cause the release of inflammatory cytokines.46 In this regard , it will be interesting to study whether the normally developing Apaf-1 mice suffer from inflammatory disease . Materials and Methods Mice . C57BL 6 mice were purchased from Nippon SLC Hamamatsu , Japan or Shimizu Laboratory Kyoto , Japan Supplies . DNase II mice20 were backcrossed to C57BL 6 at lease six times . IFN-IR mice47 in the C57BL 6 background were obtained from Michel Aguet Swiss Institute for Experimental Cancer Research , Epalinges , Switzerland . Apaf-1 mice in the C57BL 6 background were described previously.14,19 DNase II IFN-IR mice and Apaf-1 DNase II IFN-IR embryos were generated by crossing Apaf-1 ? DNase II IFN-IR parents , respectively . Mice were housed in specific pathogen-free facilities at Osaka University Medical School and Oriental Bio Service . All animal experiments were conducted according to the Guidelines for Animal Experiments of Osaka University or Kyoto University . To determine the genotype of DNase II and IFN-IR alleles , we prepared DNA from embryonic tissues or adult tail-snip tissue , as described , 48 and analyzed using PCR .

19960023	Review M D�Amelio* , 1,2 , V Cavallucci1,2 and F Cecconi* , 1,2 The role of caspases in programmed cell death has been reviewed many times.1�3 It is widely accepted that , in mam-mals , two main pathways Figure 1 have evolved for activating the caspase cascade , namely , the mitochondrial pathway intrinsic pathway and the death receptor pathway extrinsic pathway .4,5 In the intrinsic pathway , one of the major events is mitochondrial outer membrane permeabi-lization MOMP . The major role in MOMP seems to be carried out by Bcl-2 family members . These proteins are character-ized by the presence of one or more Bcl-2 homology BH domains Figure 2 and are divided into pro-Bax , Bak , etc. and antiapoptotic Bcl-2 , Bcl-XL , etc. proteins . Proapoptotic members are further divided into two subgroups the BH3-only proteins and the proteins that possess BH1 , BH2 and BH3 domains . Bax and Bak , as a consequence of apopto-tic stimuli , are subjected to conformational changes and oligomerization , 6 and they cause MOMP by destabilizing the lipid bilayer , creating pores or interacting with channels.7 Bax and Bak are counteracted by Bcl-2 antiapoptotic members , which are present in the outer membrane . In this regulation , BH3-only proteins have an important role.8 The result of MOMP is the release of cytochrome c into the cytoplasm , which in the presence of dATP induces the formation of the Apaf1-containing macromolecular complex called the apoptosome . This complex , in turn , binds and activates procaspase-9 . Mature caspase-9 remains bound to the apoptosome , recruiting and activating execu-tioner caspase-3 and or caspase-7 . The activation of cas-pase-3 and -7 is antagonized by IAPs among these , XIAP is the only direct caspase-3 inhibitor , which in turn can be inhibited by Smac Diablo and Omi HtrA2 , which are released from the intermembrane space when mitochondria are damaged . The extrinsic pathway involves signaling from a cell sur-face receptor . The best-studied death receptor is Fas Fas ligand FasL binding leads to receptor trimerization and recruitment of specific adaptor proteins . The Fas receptor contains a death domain DD in its cytoplasmic region that interacts with the adaptor protein , Fas-associated DD protein FADD , forming a death receptor-induced signaling complex DISC . Similar to DD , FADD contains a death effector domain DED and this recruits the DED-containing procaspase-8 into the DISC . Procaspase-8 is proteolytically activated to the enzymatically active caspase-8 , which in turn activates downstream effector caspases . In some cell types , the death receptor and mitochondrion-associated death pathways are not mutually exclusive and may interact with each other.9 In this case , the mitochondrial pathway is engaged through caspase-8-mediated cleavage of Bid , a proapoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family . Once cleaved , truncated Bid t-Bid translocates to the mitochondria , where it induces cytochrome c release , a crucial step in the mito-chondrial pathway , as described above . Both the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways converge at caspase-3 , which , together with other effector caspases such as caspase-7 and -6 , orchestrates the dismantling of diverse cell structures through cleavage of specific substrate . These caspase-mediated cleavages produce the phenotypic changes obser-ved in the apoptotic cell some examples are shown in Figure 1 . The caspase-dependent cell death machinery is con-served throughout evolution , from Caenorhabditis elegans to Drosophila melanogaster , and finally to mammals10 Figure 3 . The mitochondrial pathway of mammals is essentially homologous to the programmed cell death of C. elegans , except that in mammals there is the essential requirement for cytochrome c . In C. elegans , the inactive CED-3 zymogen caspases requires activation by binding to CED-4 Apaf1 , which is bound as an inactive dimer to the mitochondrial membrane by CED-9 Bcl-2 . During cell death , EGL-1 BH3-domain protein is upregulated and binds to CED-9 , displacing the CED-4 dimer , which translocates to the perinuclear membrane , where it oligomerizes and recruits proCED-3 , thus forming an apoptosome leading to CED-3 activation , which causes cell demise.11 Cytochrome c does not seem to be necessary for caspase activation indeed , CED-4 does not possess the WD-40 domain , which is a characteristic mammalian Apaf1 domain necessary for cytochrome c binding . Moreover , although CED-9 binds to the mitochondria , as Bcl-2 does , Bcl-2 acts by inhibiting MOMP , whereas in worms , MOMP is not involved in apoptosis . Nevertheless , recent studies12 suggest that mitochondria might be involved in C. elegans apoptosis , as they undergo fragmentation during cell death , and mitochondrial fission might be impor-tant for apoptosis regulation . However , mitochondrial remo-deling in C. elegans was not found to be associated with MOMP and cytochrome c release . Nucleus In Drosophila , Dark also named Hac-1 or Dapaf1 promotes the activation of the initiator caspase Dronc caspase-9 this activation is possibly regulated by the multidomain Bcl-2 family members , Debcl and Buffy . Although Dark possesses WD repeats , it seems that cytochrome c is not necessary for Drosophila apoptosome formation.13 Once activated , Dronc cleaves and activates executioner caspases Drice and Dcp-1 . DIAP1 , which is homologous to mammalian IAP proteins , has a key role in regulating Drosophila apoptosis . DIAP1 binds processed Dronc and inhibits Dronc�Dark interaction . DIAP1 can also bind Dronc and lead to its degradation . Apoptosis is induced by upregulation of DIAP1 antagonists Grim , HID and Reaper . Grim , HID and Reaper allow Dronc activation by causing DIAP1 autoubiquitination and degradation.14 Similar to the scenario outlined above in mammalian cells , effector cas-pases represent the �point-of-no-return� in the apoptotic process , and caspase-3 has a central role in the execution of cell death . However , recent studies have also pointed out the importance of the nonapoptotic function of caspase-3 . Spermatid individualization is an example of caspase-3 activation unrelated to cell death.15 During sperm differen-tiation in Drosophila , spermatids of each cyst are connec-ted by cytoplasmic bridges , and the removal of these cytoplasmic connections is necessary to form the indivi-dual sperm , a process known as individualization . The authors found that , during this process , caspase-3 is detected in BH3-ONLY the individualization complex IC , a cytoskeletal membrane complex that moves along the length of the cyst to the sperm tail . Interestingly , Dark-dependent activation of Dronc is detected in the IC , and Dark and Dronc mutants fail to complete individualization.16 Recent developments , both in caspase research and in neurophysiology , indicate that caspase-3 is important not only in apoptosis but also in physiological processes that do not cause cell death Figure 4 . In this study , we review the apoptotic role and recent findings on the nonapoptotic functions of neuronal caspase-3 , both in physiological and pathological conditions . Caspase-3 in Neurodevelopment and Differentiation Cell death in the developing nervous system is a phenomenon that has been recognized for almost a 100 years . It is estimated that half of the original cell population produced during nervous system development is eliminated by apopto-sis to optimize synaptic connections and remove unnecessary Apoptotic Stimulus CED-4 Dark Apaf-1 Apoptosome CED-4 CED-3 Dark Dronk Apaf-1 Caspase-9 Apoptosis CED-3 DrICE and DCP-1 Caspase-3 and -7 Executioner neurons . In the developing nervous system , apoptosis is observed early in neural tube formation and persists during terminal differentiation of the neural network involving neuron , glial and neural progenitor cells.17,18 With a few notable exceptions , 19,20 it seems that neurons predominantly use the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis to undergo cell death and that the central role of caspase-3 in neurodevelopment is high-lighted by abnormal brain development in knockout mice with an altered caspase-3 activation . Caspase-3-deficient mice CPP32 were generated by Kuida et al.21 Caspase-3 deficiency causes important defects of apoptosis in the nervous system and the majority of CPP32 mice die during embryonic development or between 1 and 3 weeks of age . Development of the nervous system is strongly affected in CPP32 mice that show , at postnatal day 16 P16 , prominent protrusions of brain tissue associated with skull defects , multiple indentations of the cortex , protrusions of the neuroepithelium in the retina , accumulation of supernumerary cells in the cerebellum and ectopic cell masses sited between the cerebral cortex , the hippocampus and the striatum . At embryonic day 11.5 E11.5 , CPP32 embryos show evident brain aberrations caused by cell number increase , and the lateral , third and fourth ventricles appear abnormally narrowed . A general reduction of pyknotic cells in mutant embryos indicates that the CPP32 phenotype is principally caused by apoptosis decrease . At E16.5 , the reduced apoptosis in CPP32 embryo brain is reflected in thicker and disorganized germinal zones , and in ventricles obstruction Figure 5 . The phenotype of CPP32 mice indicates that caspase-3-dependent apoptosis has an important role in the develop-ment of the nervous system . Nevertheless , the neurodevelopmental abnormalities in caspase-3-deficient mice are strain dependent , indicating that genetic factors can change the effect of caspase-3 on brain development.22 As described above , caspase-3 is present in the cell as an inactive proenzyme , which is cleaved and activated by caspase-9 . Caspase-9-deficient mice Casp9 have been generated autonomously by two groups.23,24 Caspase-9 loss results in perinatal lethality and in a dramatic malformation of the brain . Neural tube closure defect is evident in the hindbrain region of E10.5 Casp9 embryos and , at a histological level , mutants show a prominent hyperplasia of the forebrain and midbrain progenitor population with ventricular stenosis . At E13.5 , the hindbrain neural tube remains open and the Casp9 brain shows an expansion of the proliferative population and the obstruction of both the lateral and third ventricle Figure 5 . By E16.5 , the Casp9 brain shows strong alterations , with an important expansion and protrusion exencephaly of cranial tissue . Casp9 embryos show a reduction in apoptosis during early brain development , the observed brain malformation being due to this cell death failure . It is noteworthy that Casp9 embryos fail to activate caspase-3 and show a similar neuronal phenotype to that of caspase-3-deficient mice , with important brain malformations caused by an apoptosis decrease in proliferative neuro-epithelium . Caspase-9 , the upstream activator of caspase-3 , is activated as a consequence of cytochrome c release from mitochondria and apoptosome formation . Apaf1 is the core molecule of the apoptosome , and Apaf1-deficient mice Apaf1 have been generated.25 Apaf1 deficiency is lethal around stage E16.5 , and Apaf1 embryos show an abnormal development beginning at E12.5 . The brain of Apaf1 embryos , at E12.5 , presents evident morphological alterations , such as overgrowth of the diencephalon and midbrain , abnormal folding and reduced size of telencephalic vesicles because of excessive cells occluding the intaven-tricular space Figure 5 . At E16.5 , Apaf1 embryos have a strong craniofacial alteration , with evident exencephaly , midline facial cleft and skull defects . Apaf1 embryos , similar to Casp9 embryos , fail to activate caspase-3 and show a similar neuronal phenotype . These observations indicate a linear activation cascade from the apoptosome containing Apaf1 and caspase-9 to caspase-3 in developing brain and highlight the importance of caspase-3 in normal neurodevelopment . The apoptotic cascade , which leads to caspase-3 activation by apoptosome formation , starts with cytochrome c release from the mitochondria to the cytosol , where it interacts with Apaf1 . The role of cytochrome c-mediated apoptosis during neurodevelopment has been analyzed by Hao et al.26 who generated a cytochrome c knock-in mouse in which the proapoptotic function of cytochrome c is disrupted , although its electron transport function is intact . In this mouse model , the normal allele is replaced by a cytochrome c carrying the mutation of lysine 72 to alanine KA allele , having a reduced ability to interact with Apaf1 . In fact , Lys72 is essential for the EPSP 0 stability of the interaction between cytochrome c and Apaf1 , and the K72A mutation abolishes apoptosome formation . The KA homozygous mutation causes perinatal lethality and an abnormal brain development . At E14.5 , the brain of KA KA embryos shows ectopic masses with exencephalic defects , such as expansions of the cortex and midbrain , which cause cranial enlargement . The overgrowth of cortical neural tissue with obliteration of the ventricular space is evident in histological sections Figure 5 . The exencephalic phenotype of KA KA mice is strictly similar to that of Apaf1 and Casp9 mice , confirming the fundamental role of apoptotic mitochondrial pathway and caspase-3 activation during brain development . Although the above-mentioned deficient mice show a defective neuronal apoptosis and a dramatic brain phenotype , Apaf1-deficient mice show more profound malformations than those observed in other mutants . This observation suggests that Apaf1 may be involved in apoptotic pathways other than those involving caspase-3 or caspase-9 activation . Mutation of Apaf1 , but not of caspase-3 or caspase-9 , results in a delay in the removal of embryonic interdigital webs and also in abnormal eye development . Furthermore , as in the case of Caspase-3 caspase-9 deficiency , Apaf1 cells are resistant to a wide variety of apoptotic stimuli , but not to death receptor-mediated killing . Cytochrome c knock-in embryonic cells are more resistant to apoptosis induced by UV irradiation , serum starvation or staurosporin . Last but not the least , it should be mentioned that Apaf1 also has an apoptosis-unrelated function.27 Therefore , dele-tion of the Apaf1 gene may lead to a phenotype different from that involving only caspase activation . Finally , the observation that caspase-3 , caspase-9 and Apaf1-deficient mice exhibit a variably severe brain pheno-type , which is also likely to be strain dependent , suggests that caspase-independent death pathways may also influence nervous system development and may provide an alternative mechanism for regulating neuronal death.28,29 Caspase-3 activation is normally considered as one of the last steps in cell death . Although caspase-3 is a key protein in apoptosis execution , evidence also indicates a possible nonapoptotic role for this enzyme . In the context of a nonapoptotic role of caspase-3 , Fernando et al.30 suggest that it is involved in neural stem cell differentiation and not only in cell death . In particular , Caspase-3 Caspase-9 Apaf1 c Cytochrome using an in vitro system primary derived neuronal stem cells , they showed that caspase-3 activity in neuronal progenitors facilitates neurogenesis . They generated clonally derived neurospheres from the striatum of E14.5 murine embryos and observed a significant increase in caspase-3 activity during neurosphere differentiation . Interestingly , despite caspase-3 activity increase , no cleavage of PARP a caspase-3 nuclear substrate cleaved during apoptosis was observed and the caspase-3 inhibition with z-DEVD-fmk did not affect apoptosis during neurosphere differentiation , suggesting that caspase-3 activity during neurogenesis is not associated with cell death . Moreover , they showed that caspase-3 activity inhibition alters the expression of proteins associated with neurosphere differentiation and delays differentiation 1 The nestin expression normally expressed at a high level in early neuronal progenitors but not on differentiation persisted under differentiation conditions in caspase-3-inhibited neuro-spheres 2 GFAP and MBP expressions which normally increase during early formation of astrocytes and oligoden-drocytes , respectively were reduced in z-DEVD-fmk-treated neurospheres compared with those in nontreated neuro-spheres during differentiation 3 b-III tubulin which normally accumulates during differentiation conditions did not increase when caspase-3 activity was inhibited . Fernando et al. also showed that caspase-3 inhibition influences the morphology of neurospheres . The induction of differen-tiation is normally followed by an extension of neurite with wide networks extending from neurosphere bodies , which mimes the dendritic and axonal branching that occurs in vivo . Caspase-3 inhibition dramatically reduced neurite extension , suggesting that it is involved in morphological changes that occur during neurogenesis . Finally , the authors hypothesize that caspase-3 could promote neuronal differ-entiation through the activation of one or more signaling pathways by cleavage of protein kinases involved in cell differentiation . Physiological neuronal function requires the refinement of neuronal circuits by a selective elimination of axons , dendrites and synaptic connections without the death of parental neurons . This elimination , both during develop-ment and in adult tissue , can be divided into two classes small-scale events elimination of synaptic connections and the local pruning of an axonal or dendritic arbor and large-scale events elimination of a significant length of the primary axon and of major axon collaterals .31 Axonal and dendritic pruning is particularly evident in insects that undergo complete metamorphosis and build two different bodies a larval and an adult form . During this metamorphosis , the nervous system undergoes important changes , including extensive pruning of many larval neurons that have to remodel themselves to become components of the adult nervous system.32 In this context , Williams et al.33 studied dendrite pruning in the dendritic arborizing sensory neuron ddaC of Drosophila . They observed that Dronc the initiator caspase of fly deficiency suppresses the pruning of ddaC dendrites and many branches persist after puparium formation the same suppression of ddaC pruning was observed with the over-expression of a dominant-negative form of Dronc , indicating that Dronc is required for ddaC pruning . They also observed that the overexpression of either DIAP1 the fly Dronc inhibitor or p35 an inhibitor of effector caspases from baculovirus without effect on Dronc represses branch removal , indicating that effector caspases are also required in pruning . The involvement of caspases in dendritic pruning suggests that their activity is restricted to specific cellular compartments and does not cause cell death . The authors in effect proved that caspase activity is confined to the dendritic compartments of neurons during pruning and is absent in the soma or axon . Recently , the paper from Marc Tessier-Lavigne and colleagues34 has provided compelling evidence that Death Receptor-6 DR6 mediates axonal pruning and degeneration induced by trophic factor withdrawal in developing neurons . The identification of DR6 as the receptor for secreted amyloid precursor protein APP and the link of APP to axonal degeneration through the DR6 caspase-6 pathway are both extremely exciting findings . Even though the involvement of caspase-6 in neurite degeneration needs to be further established both in developing neurons and in adult brain , it may provide an alternative mechanism for regulating axon pruning independently of dendritic compartments . Caspase-3 and Neuroplasticity The opinion that caspase-3 is more than just a �killer� involved in neuronal programmed cell death is supported by recent experiments carried out in snail , bird and rat , implicating caspase-3 in the regulation of synaptic plasticity . The idea of a nonapoptotic role of caspase-3 in synaptic plasticity has been formulated on the basis of two considerations 1 many proteins that have a fundamental role in neuronal plasticity are caspase-3 substrates 35 2 in vivo and in vitro findings indicate the involvement of caspase-3 in the molecular mechanisms of learning and memory.36 The in vivo experiments that we report below use z-DEVD-fmk to inhibit caspase-3 . It should be borne in mind that , although z-DEVD-fmk is the best inhibitor known for caspase-3 , it also inhibits other proteases other caspases and noncaspases when applied in high concentrations . At present , none of the studies have tested the involvement of caspase-3 in neuroplasticity in the mammalian system using alternative approaches such as gene knockout or gene silencing . The reason for this could be the fact that i caspase-3 is a pivotal protein in neurodevelopment knockout mice are not viable in a number of genetic backgrounds or , when viable , show behavioral abnormalities because of developmental defects , ii caspase-3 knockdown by gene silencing reduces caspase-3 expression , although its activity could be unchanged , iii to date , a conditional knockout mammal model is not available . �Evidence for Synaptic Apoptosis�37 is the first study to show that apoptosis-related biochemical alterations can occur locally in synapses and dendrites of cultured neurons independently of the cell body . Mattson et al.37 showed the ability of glutamate to induce caspase-3 activation in dendrites of cultured hippocampal neurons , suggesting a role of local caspase-3 activity in synaptic and dendritic degenerative processes . Recently , Bravarenko et al. , 38 using a fluorimetric app-roach , showed that caspase-3 activity DEVDase is present in the central nervous system of the terrestrial snail , Helix Helix lucorum . Interestingly , in electrophysiological experi-ments , the authors showed that blockade of caspase-3 activity , by using a z-DEVD-fmk cell-permeable inhibitor , prevented the development of the long-term stage of synaptic input sensitization , indicating that caspase-3 is essential for long-term plasticity in invertebrate neurons . Mattson et al.37 observed dendritic localization of activated caspase-3 in cultured hippocampal neurons . However , Huesmann and Clayton39 have shown for the first time that activated caspase-3 is present , in vivo , in the postsynaptic terminal of neurons in the auditory forebrain of zebra finch the most common and familiar small passerine bird of central Australia . In addition , they observed that caspase-3 activity is necessary for the development of long-term habituation to a song , as shown using caspase-3 inhibitor . The effects of caspase-3 inhibition on different types of learning and memory were also studied in adult rats after administration of z-DEVD-fmk into cerebral ventricles . Stephanichev et al.40 showed that intracerebroventricular administration of z-DEVD-fmk decreased the number of avoidance reactions in some blocks of behavioral trials in active avoidance learning . Application of caspase-3 inhibitor z-DEVD-CHO to the cerebellar vermis stimulated the extinc-tion of an acoustic startle reaction . These results provide strong evidence for the involvement of neuronal caspase-3 in the mechanisms of learning and memory . At the electrophysiological level , Gulyaeva et al.41 showed that caspase-3 activity is required for long-term potentia-tion LTP in the CA1 region of rat hippocampus . The authors did not identify the precise molecular mechanism of cas-pase-3 involvement in LTP , although they do support the concept of the role of caspase-3 in synaptic plasticity . This result is not surprising if we consider the caspase-3 potential degradative targets in the synapse , including structural and signaling proteins.35 If caspase-3 activity contributes to synaptic plasticity , then a mechanism must also exist for limiting its proteolytic effect at the synapse level avoiding the dismantling of the rest of the neuron . It has been proposed that synaptic caspase activity is suppressed by neurotrophic factors , cytokines and or caspase inhibitors that are present in the neuronal cytoplasm . Guo and Mattson42 reported that a nine-amino acid active fragment of activity-dependent neurotrophic factor ADNF-9 can act locally in synaptic compartments to suppress oxidative stress and preserve the function of glucose and glutamate transporters . Such synaptoprotective actions sug-gest roles for activity-dependent trophic signaling in preven-ting injury-induced synaptic pruning . Interestingly , Huesman and Clayton39 found that , in zebra finch , BIRC4 XIAP coprecipitates with activated caspase-3 . They interpret this result by suggesting that a pool of caspase-3 is maintained in the activated state at the synapse level , and released and quickly resequestered in a complex with the BIRC4 inhibitor . In other words , the dynamic interaction between activated caspase-3 and XIAP which inhibits caspase-3 by binding at its active site at the synaptic terminal makes it possible to regulate caspase-3 activity by a mechanism for rapid release and sequestering at specific synaptic sites , thereby avoiding the proliferation of the caspase cascade to the rest of the neuron . Recently , Arama et al.43 showed that a cullin-3-based enzyme complex cullins are known to target proteins for degradation is required for caspase activation during sperm differentiation in Drosophila . Their results suggest that a specific cullin-3 enzyme complex activates caspases by degrading caspase inhibitors . Such degradation may provide an alternative model for how apoptotic proteins are regulated during cellular remodeling without inducing cell death . Importantly , components of this cullin-3 enzyme complex are also required for fertility in mice and humans , indicating that this mechanism has been conserved in evolution from fruit flies to humans . Given the conserved nature of these proteins , we can not exclude that they may have important implications for caspase regulation in other systems . Caspase-3 in Neurological Disease Acute and chronic neurodegenerative diseases , which include stroke , brain trauma , spinal cord injury , amyotro-phic lateral sclerosis ALS , Huntington�s disease HD , Alzheimer�s disease AD and Parkinson�s disease PD , are illnesses characterized by extensive neuronal cell death . Nevertheless , increasing clinical and morphological evidence supports the concept that synapse loss , which occurs in both acute and chronic neurodegenerative diseases , might take place before , or independently of , cell death . In this study , we summarize our current understanding of caspase-3 function in acute neurological diseases and examine the accumulating evidence of caspase-3 involve-ment in several neurodegenerative diseases . Acute neurological disease . Brain ischemia is most commonly the result of the occlusion of one of the carotids or the vertebral arteries or their branches , the resulting lack of oxygen and nutrients in ischemic areas causing neuron death . Historically , cell death after ischemic injury was considered to be a necrotic type of death characterized by rapid evolution , the sudden failure of cellular energy , and swelling and rupture of organelles.44 However , substantial cell death caused by ischemia occurs over several days after injury , 45 exhibiting several features of apoptosis , including chromatin condensation , DNA fragmentation , TdT-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling TUNEL and activation of caspases . Therefore , there is a pattern of combined necrotic and apoptotic cell death after brain ischemia and traumatic injury . Necrotic cell death occurs in the core of the infarction where hypoxia is most severe conversely , apoptotic cell death takes place in the ischemic penumbra where the degree of energy oxygen deprivation is not drastic . Three experimental models of ischemic injury have been described 1 the middle cerebral artery occlusion MCAo model of ischemia in adult rats46,47 and mice 47,48 2 the carotid artery occlusion model of ischemia in adult rats49 and gerbils50 and 3 the model of hypoxic�ischemic brain injury in neonatal rats.51 Caspase-3 was activated in all three models of ischemic injury . Neurodegenerative disease . Together with acute neuronal trauma and ischemia , chronic neurodegenerative diseases are also characterized by the loss of selective neuronal populations , which often results in loss of cognitive and motor functions . Cell death in chronic neurodegenerative disorders often occurs as a result of a mutation in one or several genes , although epigenetic and environmental factors have also been involved in chronic neurodegeneration . Neuronal death in many neurodegenerative diseases such as AD , HD , PD and ALS occurs , at least in part , by apoptosis , although this remains controversial the main reason for this controversy is that the commonly used technique for detecting apoptosis in postmortem tissues is sometimes subject to artifacts . Many studies have investigated the role of caspases and , in particular , of caspase-3 in neurodegenerative disease . Several proteins that are linked to neurodegenerative diseases such as huntingtin , APP and presenilins are also cleaved by caspase-3 . On the basis of such evidence , a challenging hypothesis might be that the caspase-3-mediated cleavage of these proteins may promote the onset of neurodegenerative disease and terminally execute the terminal step of apoptosis . Below , evidence for the involve-ment of caspase-3 in AD , PD , HD and ALS is summarized . Alzheimer�s disease . AD is the most common cause of dementia.52 The neuropathological findings of amyloid-beta Ab plaques and tau-containing neurofibrillary tangles represent important molecular clues to the underlying pathogenesis . Genetic factors are well recognized three rare forms of autosomal-dominant early-onset familial AD have been identified and are associated with mutations in APP , presenilin 1 and presenilin 2 genes.53 Several studies have shown that neuronal loss in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus is the major cause for cognitive decline in AD , although support for apoptosis as a mechanism for neuronal death in AD has been tempered in recent years . Evidence for apoptosis in AD came from cell culture experiments , including exposure of neuronal cells to high concentrations of Ab . Using TUNEL assay , evidence of DNA fragmentation in tissue sections of the brain from AD patients has been shown by several groups.54,55 In some cases , as described in the above-cited studies , TUNEL-positive cells exhibited an apoptotic-like morphology , such as granulated and marginated chromatin , shrunken and irregular cell shapes and the presence of apoptotic bodies . Never-theless , in other cases , the majority of TUNEL-positive cells showed few or none of the classical morphological features of apoptosis.56 Recent reports indicate that presenilins presenelin 1 and 2 are linked to early-onset familial AD are cleaved by caspase-3 in cells undergoing apoptosis . Caspase-3 also cleaves purified presenilins in vitro.57,58 The significance of presenilin cleavage by caspase in AD is not known . One model proposed is that caspase-mediated cleavage of presenilins may promote the pathological generation of Ab . However , an alteration of the caspase cleavage site in presenilins did not affect the ability of these genes to promote Ab production.59 Tanzi and colleagues showed60 that GGA3 , an adaptor protein involved in beta-site APP-cleaving enzyme BACE trafficking , regulates BACE levels and b-secretase activity . In addition , the authors showed that GGA3 is a substrate of caspase-3 and the levels of GGA3 are decreased and inversely correlated with increased levels of BACE in AD . Therefore , this study suggests a novel mechanism in which caspase-3 , by cleaving of GGA3 , impairs the degradation and stabilization of BACE and this would then lead to increased production of the Ab peptide , thereby contributing to AD pathogenesis . Recent studies have proposed that TAR DNA-binding protein-43 , TDP-43 identified as a major disease protein in frontotemporal lobar degeneration with ubiquitin-positive inclusions , FTLD-U , may also be a substrate for caspase-3 cleavage , generating an approximate 25 kDa fragment that has been identified in brain fractions from FTDL-U and ALS patients.61 TDP-43 is a nuclear protein that is highly conserved and ubiquitously expressed in all tissues , the function of which may be exon skipping and splicing inhibi-tory activity.62 Interestingly , postmortem brain section analy-sis indicated the presence of caspase-cleaved TDP-43 in Hirano bodies , as well as in tangles , reactive astrocytes and neuritic plaques of the AD brain.63 This result suggests that caspase-cleaved TDP-43 is a major finding in AD however , more studies are needed to determine whether caspase-3 cleavage of TDP-43 is an early or late event , and how it may contribute to the neurodegeneration associated with this disease . An important role for caspase-3 in synapse degeneration is suggested by Louneva et al.64 The authors found , in both control and AD cases , a selective enrichment of caspase-3 at synapses , particularly in the postsynaptic compartment . Moreover , AD patients exhibited significant increases in synaptic procaspase-3 and active caspase-3 expression levels compared with age-matched controls . These findings encourage to study the molecular mechanisms by which active caspase-3 might lead to progressive synaptic degen-eration and ultimately to synaptic loss , the best pathological correlate of cognitive decline in AD.65 Parkinson�s disease . PD is a progressive movement disorder , described in 1817 by Dr James Parkinson , a British physician after whom the disease is named . PD is characterized by four major clinical features a rest tremor of a limb b slowness of movement c rigidity of the limbs or trunk and d poor balance.66 Degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra underlies the motor dysfunction in PD . Some studies on postmortem brain tissue of PD patients have reported the presence of apoptotic cells and DNA fragmentation in the substantia nigra.67,68 However , the significance of purely morphological human postmortem features suggestive of apoptosis has remained controversial , and the results of investigations into molecular apoptotic markers in PD brains are awaited to confirm the morphological studies.69 Recently , Hartmann et al. showed that caspase-3 is a critical factor for cell death in the sub-stantia nigra of PD patients.70 Using caspase-3 immuno-histochemistry on postmortem human brain , the authors observed a a positive correlation between the degree of neuronal loss in affected dopaminergic neurons in the mesencephalon of PD patients and the percentage of caspase-3-positive neurons in the same neurons in control subjects and b a significant decrease in caspase-3-positive pigmented neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta of PD patients compared with controls . In other words , neurons expressing caspase-3 are more sensitive to the pathological process , indicating that caspase-3 is a vulnerability factor and final effector in the apoptotic death of dopaminergic neurons in PD . Interestingly , Parkin protein has recently been identified as a substrate of caspase-3.71 This result supports the hypothesis that Parkin cleavage may contribute to a vicious cycle in neurons in which caspase activation , initiated by , for example , hitherto unknown causes in sporadic PD , compromises Parkin function , hence lowering the cellular stress threshold and leading to further caspase activation . Huntington�s disease . HD , also known as Huntington�s chorea or chorea major , is a neurodegenerative genetic disorder that is the most common genetic cause of repetitive abnormal movements called chorea . HD is caused by expansions of CAG repeats in the huntingtin gene resulting in polyglutamine repeats in the huntingtin protein.72 Several observations pinpoint to apoptotic neuronal death in the striatum in the course of HD . Dragunow et al.73 showed DNA strand breaks in striatal neurons . Moreover , huntingtin has been shown to be a substrate for caspase-3 , the rate of cleavage increasing with the length of the huntingtin polyglutamine tract and thus providing an explanation for the gain-of-function associated with CAG expansion . Cleaved huntingtin would in turn cause additional stress on the cell , resulting in additional caspase cleavage and eventual apoptosis . The results obtained from a recently described model of polyglutamine-induced , late-onset cell degeneration in Drosophila support this hypothesis . Indeed , Warrick et al.74 showed that coexpression of p35 , a caspase inhibitor , restores partial pigmentation to the eyes in which expression of polyglutamines induces loss of pigmentation and progressive degeneration of the eye . Recently , Toulmond et al.75 showed that an inhibition of caspase-3 activity by the reversible caspase-3 inhibitor M-826 results in a significant reduction in neuronal death after striatal lesions in adult rats . Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis . ALS , the most common motor neuron disease in human adults is ALS , also known as Lou Gehrig�s Disease . ALS is characterized by the progressive and specific loss of motor neurons in the brain , brain stem and spinal cord.76 Familial ALS-linked mutations in the copper�zinc superoxide dismutase SOD1 gene cause motor neuron death in about 3 % of ALS cases . Although the main toxic properties of familial ALS-linked mutations in SOD1 remain unclear , the terminal step in the death cascade has been established as an activation of caspase-3 . Activation of caspase-3 is a central feature in cell death mediated by mutant SOD1 , appearing in motor neurons77,78 and astrocytes at the time of the earliest motor neuron death in all three of the best-studied mouse models of ALS . In the mouse model SOD1G93A , the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria is followed by acti-vation of caspase-9 and activation of caspase-3.79 Moreover , mice bearing a transgenic Bcl-2 gene survive longer than other ALS mice.80 Finally , the finding of caspase-3 and caspase-1 activation in the spinal cord of patients with ALS indicates the clinical relevance of ALS mouse models.79,81 Conclusions Neuronal caspase-3 transduces irreversible or lifelong signa-ling through substrate cleavage . A strong activation of caspase-3 determines the cell fate however , local activation , substrate specificities and its activation level all seem to be involved in many regulatory mechanisms , ranging from physiological neuron death during neurodevelopment to neuron death in neurological diseases , from synapse pruning during differentiation to synapse degeneration , and from synaptic plasticity in normal brain functioning to synaptic pathology observed in neurodegenerative disease . It is expected that , in coming years , additional caspase-3 inhibi-tors will become a part of the drugs that clinicians administer everyday to patients suffering from neurological diseases involving caspase-mediated neuronal dysfunction and neuro-nal death .

Activation of executioner caspases-3 and -7 is the key event in mammalian apoptosis , and two major mechanisms exist to carry out this task see also text . The intrinsic pathway involves the mitochondrion , which acts as an intracellular death receptor receiving a variety of proapoptotic signals that trigger oligomerization of proapoptotic proteins Bcl-2-associated protein , Bax , and Bcl-2-antagonist killer , Bak , to produce mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization , MOMP . This leads to the release of cytochrome c , which activates Apaf1 , induction of apoptosome formation , procaspase-9 recruitment activation and direct processing and activation of procaspase-3 and -7 . In the extrinsic pathway , Fas receptor ligand FasL triggers the membrane-bound Death-Inducing Signaling Complex DISC , which recruits procasapase-8 and activates caspase-3 directly . In some cell types , caspase-8 can also cleave Bid to form tBid , which interacts with Bax Bak to trigger MOMP , cytochrome c release and apoptosome formation . The activation of caspase-3 and -7 is antagonized by IAPs , which in turn can be inhibited by Smac Diablo and Omi HtrA2 . Activation of caspase-3 and -7 orchestrates the demolition of the cell by cleavage of specific substrates , such as ICAD , 82 Rho effector ROCK1,83 kinase MST1,84 PARP , 85 transcription and translation initiation factors86 Figure 2 The Bcl-2 family . The Bcl-2 family comprises three subfamilies that contain between one and four Bcl-2 homology BH domains . The antiapoptotic subfamily comprises proteins that contain four BH domains . Most members of this subfamily also contain transmembrane domains TM and are therefore typically associated with membranes . The proapoptotic BAX-like subfamily lacks the BH4 domain . The BH3-only subfamily is a structurally diverse group of proteins , which only show homology within the small BH3 motif Figure 3 Conservation of the caspase-dependent cell death machinery . Apaf1 and caspases are well conserved throughout evolution see also text . In C. elegans , the inactive CED-3 zymogen caspases requires activation by binding to CED-4 Apaf1 . During cell death , CED-4 translocates to the perinuclear membrane , where it oligomerizes and recruits proCED-3 forming an apoptosome , which activates CED-3 , which causes cell death . In Drosophila , Dark Apaf1 promotes the activation of the initiator caspase Dronc caspase-9 . Once activated , Dronc cleaves and activates the executioner caspases Drice and Dcp-1 Figure 4 Nonapoptotic caspase-3 functions in neuronal cells . Caspase-3 activation mediates nonapoptotic neuronal functions , including synaptic plasticity , dendrite pruning , as well as learning and memory processes Figure 5 Histological analysis related to the gene targeting of the caspase-3 activation component .

20019746	www.nature.com cdd Paired-like homeodomain 2 Pitx2 is a member of the bicoid class of paired homeodomain proteins that is mutated in patients affected by the Axenfeld�Rieger syndrome ARS , an autosomal dominant haploinsufficient disorder that includes tooth anomalies , anterior segment eye defects , umbilical abnormalities , and facial dysmorphologies as cardinal fea-tures.1 The phenotype of mice with targeted deletion of Pitx2 mimics , in part , Axenfeld�Rieger syndrome , 2�5 and its analysis established the critical role of Pitx2 in the develop-ment of cranio-facial structures , and of multiple organs including eye , pituitary , heart , and lung . Pitx2 is expressed in myotomes and migrating myoblasts3,6,7 and has been implicated in growth and survival of branchiomeric muscle progenitors.7�9 At early developmental stages , Pitx2 has been involved in the establishment of left�right asymmetry.10�13 We previously showed that Pitx2 activates the transcription of specific growth-regulating genes such as those encoding Ccnd1 and Ccnd2 also known as Cyclins D1 and D2 and it is also profoundly involved in the stabilization of the correspond-ing messengers during Wnt activation.6,14 Moreover , Pitx2 mRNA is stabilized by Wnt activation , and this effect is mediated by AU-rich elements AREs in its 30 untranslated region 30UTR .14 We showed that Pitx2 protein is required for stabilization of its own mRNA , as well as of those encoding Ccnd1 and Ccnd2.14 This effect is achieved , in part , by modulating the function of the ARE-binding protein ARE-BP HuR as Pitx2 and HuR belong to the same complex.14 It is now clear that mRNA decay regulation by different signals makes a huge contribution to the global control of gene expression.15 AREs , located in the 30UTR of many short-lived transcripts , promote mRNA deadenylation , decapping , and degradation , with ARE-BPs functioning as trans-acting factors responsible for the modulation of decay rates.16,17 Some ARE-BPs are decay-promoting factors TTP , BRF1 , KSRP and others , such as HuR , are stabilizing factors.16 Skeletal muscle formation or myogenesis is a complex and highly regulated process that involves the proliferation of myoblasts , followed by morphological , biochemical , and molecular modifications , which result in the formation of multinucleated myotubes.18�20 The C2C12 myogenic cell line , derived from regenerating adult mouse skeletal muscle , provides a good in vitro model for studying the major steps of myoblast proliferation and differentiation 21 and literature cited therein . We have reported that the tight control of the decay rates of transcripts encoding several pro-myogenic factors , in addition to their transcriptional regulation , is essential to ensure that the correct differentiation program takes place.21�23 HuR , regulating the expression of the mRNAs encoding the pro-myogenic transcription factors MyoD and myogenin has a key role in muscle fiber formation.21,22 As HuR and Pitx2 associate to stabilize target transcripts , 14 we hypothesized that the two proteins could cooperate to affect the fate of myoblasts during the myogenic process . In this study , we report that Pitx2 is necessary to ensure proper C2C12 myoblast proliferation and differentia-tion . Pitx2 and HuR belong to the same ribonucleoprotein complex that controls the decay rate of the Ccnd1 mRNA , and this function is regulated by Pitx2 phosphorylation by Akt2 . Results Pitx2 is phosphorylated by Akt2 in C2C12 myoblasts . In a screening for protein serine threonine kinases able to phosphorylate in vitro Pitx2 Gherzi R , unpublished results , we found that Akt2 is able to phosphorylate , in a concentration-dependent manner , the purified recombinant Pitx2c portion encompassing amino acids 1�160 , whereas it does not phosphorylate the C-terminal part of the protein including amino acids 161�324 Figure 1a , left panel . An in silico search http scansite.mit.edu for potential Akt2 phosphorylation sites indicated threonine 97 , embedded in a nearly perfect consensus sequence RQRTHFT , as the most probable Akt2 target residue . Indeed , Akt2 failed to phosphorylate the mutant Pitx2c 1�160 in which threonine 97 was substituted with alanine Pitx2c 1�160T97A , Figure 1a , right panel . The sequence RQRTHFT is located in the homeodomain , is present in the three Pitx2 splicing variants , and is evolutionarily conserved from Drosophila to human Figure 1b . As expected , Akt2 is able to phosphorylate in vitro Pitx2a and b data not shown . Akt1 does not phosphorylate Pitx2c in vitro , although it phosphorylates KSRP , which is used as a control 24 Figure 1c . Interestingly , human PITX2A is phosphorylated by PKC in 10 different residues including threonine 44 , which corresponds to mouse Pitx2c threonine 97.25 Considering the role of Pitx2 during muscle development8,9 and the function of PI3K�Akt signaling in myoblast differentia-tion , 26,27 we chose to study the functional relevance of Pitx2 phosphorylation by Akt2 in C2C12 cells that differentiate into myotubes upon shift from growth medium GM to low-serum-containing differentiation medium DM .23 As shown in Figure 1d , endogenous Pitx2 was phosphorylated in response to DM in intact C2C12 cells . Furthermore , constitutively active Akt2 induced 32P incorpora-tion into Flag-tagged Pitx2c when coexpressed in proliferating C2C12 cells Supplementary Figure S1a . Finally , Akt2 immunopurified from C2C12 cells , either maintained in GM or exposed to DM for different intervals of time , was used to phosphorylate Pitx2c 1�160 in vitro . As shown in Supple-mentary Figure S1b , the kinase activity of Akt2 toward Pitx2c was rapidly 1 h enhanced by exposure to DM. Akt2 activity was maintained up to 36 h in DM and started declining between 36 and 48 h of differentiation , whereas the expres-sion of the enzyme remained unchanged Supplementary Figure S1b . Altogether , these data show that Pitx2 is a substrate for Akt2 at early phases of C2C12 cell differentiation . Pitx2 is required for C2C12 myoblast differentiation . To gain an insight into Pitx2 function in the course of C2C12 cell differentiation , we transiently knocked down the three Pitx2 isoforms by RNA interference siRNA , Figure 2a . The expression of some myogenic differentiation markers , including Myog also called myogenin , Ckm also called muscle creatine kinase , Myod1 , and Cdkn1a also called p21 , was severely impaired in siPitx2-transfected C2C12 cells induced to differentiate by DM Figure 2b . On the contrary , the expression of an early marker of myoblast progenitors and satellite cells Pax7 , as well as markers of myogenic determination such as Myf5 , and Myf6 also called Mrf4 20 remained unchanged Supplementary Figure S1c . Pax3 , another marker of myoblast progenitors , 20 is not expressed in C2C12 cells . To extend our observations , we prepared a short-hairpin sh RNA-based vector targeting mouse Pitx2 and generated two independent stable C2C12 clones , in which approxi-mately 70 % of Pitx2 was knocked down data not shown . The two clones yielded superimposable results and henceforth are collectively cited as C2C12-shPitx2 cells . We confirmed in C2C12-shPitx2 cells that Pitx2 is required for the proper expression of myogenic factors Figure 2c , Supplementary Figure S1d , e , including members of the recently described class of myogenic miRNAs28 Supplementary Figure S1f . Accordingly , connexin 43 , a described target of miR-206 , was upregulated in C2C12-shPitx2 cells 28 and literature cited therein Supplementary Figure S1g . Our data indicate that Pitx2 is required for differentiation of C2C12 myoblasts into myotubes . Pitx2 controls C2C12 myoblast proliferation and affects Ccnd1 mRNA decay . We previously reported that Pitx2 controls cell proliferation in specific tissues.6 Here , we found that Pitx2 knockdown causes a growth reduction in C2C12 cells cultured in GM as assessed by crystal violet staining Supplementary Figure S2a . Using C2C12-shPitx2 cells , we confirmed by both BrdU incorporation into DNA and crystal violet staining that Pitx2 knockdown reduces the proliferation of exponentially growing myoblasts , whereas it does not affect the proliferation rate of cells cultured in DM Figure 3a and b . Conversely , Pitx2 knockdown did not induce apoptosis in C2C12 cells Supplementary Figure S2b . In agreement with our previous findings , 6,14 Pitx2 knock-down reduced the expression of Ccnd1 in proliferating C2C12 myoblasts Figure 3c , Supplementary Figure S2c , whereas it did not affect Ccnd1 expression in differentiating C2C12 cells Supplementary Figure S2d . Surprisingly , we found that Pitx2 is predominantly cyto-plasmic in C2C12 cells and this observation was confirmed by using two different anti-Pitx2 antibodies Figure 3d and data not shown . We previously reported that Pitx2 is able to controls the expression of Ccnd1 and other transcripts at both transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels.6,14 The subcellular localization of Pitx2 in C2C12 cells prompted us to investigate the consequences of Pitx2 knockdown on the decay rate of Ccnd1 mRNA in these cells . In vitro degradation assays revealed that Ccnd1 mRNA is stable in proliferating C2C12 myoblasts and its half-life is reduced by serum withdrawal-induced differentiation Supplementary Figure S3a . These data are consistent with the reduction in Ccnd1 mRNA levels that we observed in the course of C2C12 cell differentiation Supplementary Figure S3b . Most importantly , transient Pitx2 knockdown significantly shortened the Ccnd1 transcript half-life in intact proliferating C2C12 myoblasts , whereas the decay rate of Myog mRNA was unaffected Figure 3e . Similar results were obtained on stable Pitx2 knockdown using in vitro degradation assays Supplementary Figure S3c . We have previously shown that , although it is not able to directly bind to mRNA , Pitx2 participates in a ribonucleopro-tein complex containing , among others , the mRNA stabilizing factor HuR 14 Briata P , unpublished . Furthermore , HuR has been reported to target the inherently labile Ccnd1 transcript and to induce its stabilization.29,30 By ribonucleoprotein complex immunoprecipitation RIP analysis , we found that anti-Pitx2 antibody immunoprecipitates a Ccnd1 mRNA-containing ribonucleoprotein complex from C2C12 cell extracts and that this interaction is reduced by cell differentia-tion Figure 3f upper panel . Similarly , HuR binding to Ccnd1 mRNA is reduced in differentiated C2C12 myotubes when compared with proliferating C2C12 myoblasts Figure 3f lower panel . These results suggest that Pitx2 modulates cell proliferation and Ccnd1 mRNA half-life by participating in a ribonucleo-protein complex that contains HuR . Phosphorylation by Akt2 impairs the ability of Pitx2 to associate with a Ccnd1 mRNA-stabilizing complex . On the basis of the above results , we investigated whether HuR�Ccnd1 mRNA interaction depends on Pitx2 . As shown in Figure 4a , transient Pitx2 knockdown reduced the interaction of HuR with Ccnd1 mRNA in proliferating C2C12 cells upper panel without affecting HuR expression levels lower panel . PI3K�Akt activation favors the differentiation of myoblasts into myotubes 26 and Figure 4b left panel . Importantly , forced activation of Akt2 induced a significant reduction in Ccnd1 mRNA levels in C2C12 cells , reducing the half-life of Ccnd1 mRNA Figure 4b right panel , Supplementary Figure S3d . Furthermore , Akt2 activation decreased the ability of Pitx2 to participate in the Ccnd1 stabilizing complex Figure 4c , upper panel and of HuR to interact with Ccnd1 mRNA Figure 4c , lower panel . It is well known that phosphorylation by Akt kinases can change the ability of substrate proteins to interact with molecular partners.31 By GST pull-down experiments , we found that phosphorylation by Akt2 increases the ability of Pitx2c to interact with the multifunctional protein 14-3-3 while decreasing its ability to interact with HuR Figure 4d . Under the same conditions , Pitx2cT97A , which does not undergo Akt2 phosphorylation Figure 1a , was unable to interact with 14-3-3 , whereas it associated with HuR Figure 4d . Accordingly , coimmunoprecipitation experiments revealed that Pitx2 interaction with HuR was strongly reduced in C2C12 cells cultured in DM , whereas Pitx2 interaction with 14-3-3 was increased Figure 4e and f , and Supplementary Figure S3e . Next , we investigated whether the expression of Pitx2c-T97A in C2C12 cells Supplementary Figure 3f interferes with their differentiation . First , RIP experiments revealed that Ccnd1 mRNA remained associated with Pitx2cT97A expressed in C2C12 cells on differentiation induction Figure 5a . In keeping with these observations , Pitx2cT97A remained associated with HuR on shift of C2C12 cells to DM Figure 5b . As shown in Figure 5c , DM failed to downregulate Ccnd1 mRNA and induce myogenin mRNAs in C2C12 cells expressing Pitx2cT97A . Altogether , our data indicate that Pitx2 is a required factor for HuR�Ccnd1 mRNA interaction in proliferating C2C12 myoblasts and that Akt2 activation , inducing Pitx2 phosphorylation , causes its dismissal from the Ccnd1 mRNA-stabilizing complex . Discussion In this report , we show that Pitx2 is necessary to ensure proper proliferation of C2C12 myoblasts under high-serum culture conditions , as well as for their differentiation under low-serum culture conditions . In C2C12 cells , Pitx2 predominantly localizes in the cytoplasm and is part of an mRNA-stabilizing complex , including the ARE-BP HuR , which controls the Ccnd1 mRNA half-life . On Pitx2 phosphorylation by Akt2 , the Pitx2 HuR-containing complex is dismissed from Ccnd1 mRNA leading to destabilization of the transcript . The contribution of different Akt isoforms to myoblast differentiation is still debated.32 We found that Akt1 does not phosphorylate Pitx2c in vitro . This result is consistent with previous observations of isoform-specific phosphorylation of cellular substrates by Akt family members33,34 and with the reported preference for an arginine residue at position-5 absent in Pitx2c Akt recognition consensus site as displayed by Akt1.35 It has been shown that Pitx2 is implicated in myogenesis during mouse embryonic development.8,9 In this study , we propose that , in proliferating C2C12 myoblasts , Pitx2 is required to maintain an adequate rate of cell division . A similar role has been suggested for Pax3 and Pax7 in satellite cell-derived myoblasts.36 Pax3 is not expressed in C2C12 cells , whereas Pax7 expression is not affected by Pitx2 knockdown , thus suggesting that Pitx2 and Pax7 may regulate parallel pathways that converge on common target genes . However , it is noteworthy that Pitx2 knockdown is sufficient to severely impair the expression of myogenic differentiation markers such as Myog , Myod1 , Ckm , Cdkn1a , as well as myogenic miRNAs . We propose that Pitx2 , in concert with Pax3 and Pax7 , keeps myoblasts actively proliferating and poised for differentiation in response to appropriate environmental conditions . In our hypothesis , Pitx2 promotes C2C12 cell expansion , while maintaining commit-ment to the myogenic lineage . We previously reported that Pitx2 can exert a dual role regulating the expression of target genes not only transcrip-tionally but also posttranscriptionally , being able to modulate the turnover rate of select ARE-containing mRNAs , including Ccnd1 , in response to Wnt b-catenin activation.14 We now report that , in C2C12 cells , Pitx2 displays a predominant cytoplasmic localization and this observation prompted us to analyze in detail the role of Pitx2 on Ccnd1 mRNA turnover . Ccnd1 mRNA is rather stable in proliferating C2C12 myo - blasts , whereas it is destabilized on serum withdrawal-induced differentiation . Pitx2 seems to participate in these events because its knockdown reduces Ccnd1 transcript half-life and steady-state levels in proliferating C2C12 myoblasts . Studies conducted in Gorospe�s laboratory reported that Ccnd1 mRNA is a direct target of the stabilizing ARE-BP HuR.30 Indeed , we observed that HuR interaction with Ccnd1 mRNA is modulated by differentiation . We have previously suggested a role for Pitx2 in controlling HuR function in the context of a stabilizing ribonucleoprotein complex.14 Our present evidence , suggesting that Pitx2 knockdown impairs the ability of HuR to interact with Ccnd1 mRNA , emphasizes the role of Pitx2 as a required component of the HuR-containing stabilizing ribonucleoprotein complex . It has been shown that activation of the PI3K-Akt pathway strongly stimulates myogenesis , greatly increasing myotube formation in myoblast cultures and upregulating muscle-specific proteins.26,27 Here , we propose that Akt2-induced downregulation of Ccnd1 expression through destabilization of its mRNA represents an additional mechanism by which the signaling pathway controls the transition from the undiffer-entiated to the differentiated state in C2C12 cells . We previously reported that the PI3K-Akt pathway can affect the decay rate of ARE-containing transcripts regulating the function of relevant ARE-BPs.24 Once phosphorylated by Akt1 2 , KSRP and Brf1 , two destabilizing ARE-BPs , interact with the multifunctional protein 14-3-3 and , in turn , their function is compromised.24,37 HuR is not a substrate for Akt kinases Gherzi R , unpublished observation and we show that Akt2 activation modulates the function of HuR indirectly , through Pitx2 phosphorylation . The T97A Pitx2c mutant , which is not phosphorylated by Akt2 , is present in a ribonucleoprotein complex including HuR and Ccnd1 mRNA on shifting C2C12 culture medium to DM and , as a consequence , Ccnd1 expression is not down-regulated . Interestingly , myogenin mRNA levels are not induced in the same cells . These results strengthen the idea that modulation of Ccnd1 mRNA levels by Pitx2c is one of the mechanisms underlying C2C12 myoblast differentiation . Indeed , reduction of Ccnd1 transcript on specific knockdown in proliferating C2C12 myoblasts reduced the expression of some muscle-specific transcripts Briata P , unpublished , thus underscoring the requirement of a proper proliferation rate for the subsequent full differentiation . We propose that , in proliferating C2C12 myoblasts , Pitx2 interacts with HuR favoring its binding to Ccnd1 mRNA , which becomes more stable . When cells are shifted to DM , Akt2-phosphorylated Pitx2 fails to interact with HuR , whereas it associates with 14-3-3 . Consequently , HuR no longer binds to Ccnd1 mRNA , whose half-life is shortened . This mechanism summarized in the model presented in Figure 5d contributes to maintain a high proliferation rate in C2C12 cells cultured in GM and to arrest cell proliferation on shift to DM . Materials and Methods Cell cultures , transfections , plasmids , and adenoviral infections . Murine C2C12 myoblasts were cultured in DMEM plus 20 % FBS Growth Medium , GM .

20057499	Y Niikura1 , H Ogi1 , K Kikuchi1 and K Kitagawa* , 1 Aneuploidy � the presence of an abnormal number of chromosomes � is the primary cause of miscarriages , mental retardation , and congenital abnormalities in humans and is a hallmark of cancer.1 The role of aneuploidy in cancer has been hotly debated for almost a century , and recent evidence has shown a tight link between aneuploidy and tumorigenesis.2,3 Aneuploidy is frequently caused by chromosome missegre-gation during mitosis , which results from errors of the mitotic checkpoint , the major cell cycle control mechanism that prevents chromosome missegregation.4,5 The spindle checkpoint arrests cell cycle progression before anaphase if chromosomes are unattached or in-correctly attached , by transiently inhibiting the anaphase-promoting complex APC C .6,7 Kinetochores that are improperly attached to microtubules send a signal to the spindle checkpoint components � Mad1 , Mad2 , BUBR1 Mad3-like , but has a C-terminal kinase domain , Bub1 , Bub3 , and Mps1 � all originally identified in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.8�10 These components and their functions are highly conserved between yeast and humans11 and are essential for the mitotic checkpoint in human cells as bona fide mitotic checkpoint proteins.12,13 Consistent with a link between aneuploidy and cancer , several facts support the role of the spindle checkpoint in tumorigenesis . For example , mutations in the human homo-logs of Bub1 BUB1 and BUBR1 have been observed in subtypes of colorectal cancer cells that exhibit chromosome instability CIN tumor cells .14 The CIN phenotype has been associated with mutations in spindle checkpoint genes , 15�17 decreased levels of spindle checkpoint proteins , 18,19 and loss www.nature.com cdd of spindle checkpoint activity.20,21 Mad2 ? � mice develop lung tumors at high rates after a long latency.22 Bubr1 ? � mice and Bub3 Rae1 heterozygotes are prone to tumor develop-ment.23,24 These results strongly suggest a close relationship between altered activity of the spindle checkpoint and tumorigenesis . Moreover , importantly , many tumor cells have a diminished , but not absent , spindle checkpoint response.12 When cells can not satisfy the spindle checkpoint after a long mitotic delay known as adaptation to D-mitosis , several cell fates can occur some cells die during mitosis , some exit mitosis as viable cells but die as a result of apoptosis in the G1 phase , and some exit mitosis as viable cells but are tetraploid and reproductively dead.7 Microtubule inhibitors induce mitotic arrest by activating the spindle checkpoint eventually , these inhibitors cause cytotoxicity . Many reports have described the cytotoxicity of microtubule inhibitors and resultant cell death as either apoptosis in G1 or reproductive death.25 However , questions regarding cell death during mitosis have remained . Although many studies suggest that cell death occurs during mitosis , 26�30 the mechanism remains to be detailed , especially with regard to the relationship between the spindle checkpoint and apoptosis during mitosis . We recently identified a novel type of mitotic cell death , which we term caspase-independent mitotic death CIMD .31,32 Caspase-independent mitotic death is a pro-grammed cell death in early mitosis that is induced by defects in the kinetochore�microtubule attachment in BUB1-deficient cells . In BUB1-deficient but not MAD2 deficient cells , CIMD is induced by conditions that activate the spindle checkpoint i.e. , cold shock or treatment with nocodazole , paclitaxel Taxol , or 17-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin 17-AAG . Caspase-independent mitotic death depends on p73 , a homolog of p53 , but not on p53 . It also depends on the apoptosis-inducing factor AIF and endonuclease G Endo G , which are effectors of caspase-independent cell death.33 When BUB1 is completely depleted , aneuploidy occurs instead of CIMD . We propose that CIMD is the cell death mechanism that protects cells from aneuploidy by inducing the death of cells prone to substantial chromosome missegregation . In this study , we determined the molecular mechanism by which CIMD is activated by partial but not complete depletion of BUB1 . Results CIMD occurs independently of caspases . In our previous study , we detected no caspase activity caspases 1 , 3�9 in cells in which BUB1 is partially depleted using small interfering RNA siRNA and exposed to 17-AAG or Taxol.32 In addition , pharmacological caspase inhibitors bocaspartyl-OMe -fluoromethyl-ketone BAF and Z-VAD-FMK zVAD did not inhibit DNA fragmentation induced by 17-AAG or Taxol treatment and BUB1 partial depletion using siRNA.32 Therefore , we concluded that CIMD is caspase independent . To strengthen our conclusion , we tested caspases 2 and 10�13 and observed no caspase activity in cells in which CIMD occurs Supplementary Figure S1 . We also tested whether CIMD occurs in mouse embryonic fibroblasts deficient in caspases 3 and 734 and observed that CIMD occurs in the absence of these caspases Figure 1a�c . These results strongly suggest that CIMD is independent of caspases . p73 depletion rescues the lethality of cells in which CIMD occurs . As we previously reported , 32 when BUB1 is partially depleted from HeLa cells by siRNA and cells are subsequently treated with 17-AAG or Taxol , substantial synergistic lethality is observed in a colony outgrowth assay Figure 2a and b . We previously reported that this lethality is due to CIMD . Because the occurrence of DNA fragmentation is dependent on p73 but not on p53,32 we examined whether depletion of p73 rescues the lethality caused by CIMD in the colony outgrowth assay . Although we could not detect p73 in HeLa cells by immunoblotting data not shown , the amount of p73a mRNA was significantly suppressed when two independent sets of p73 siRNAs were used Supplementary Figure S2 Supplementary Table S2 . Depletion of p73a rescued the lethality induced by BUB1 partial depletion Supplementary Figure S3 right panel and drug treatment in the colony outgrowth assay , whereas single p73 depletion and drug treatment did not cause significant lethality Figure 2a and b . These results indicate that p73 depletion rescues the lethality of cells in which CIMD occurs . Survived cells that escape CIMD have abnormal nuclei . We hypothesized that CIMD is an alternative cell death pathway that protects cells from aneuploidy by killing cells prone to substantial chromosome missegregation.31,32 If this hypothesis is true , survived cells that escape CIMD by depletion of p73 in the colony outgrowth assay should be aneuploid . There was a significant increase in the number of abnormal nuclei in cells with p73 ? BUB1 double siRNA and drug 17-AAG or Taxol treatment Figure 2c and d . The resulting abnormal nuclei i.e. , fragmented and aggregated nuclei consisting of more than three nuclei-like fragments , micronuclei , chromosome bridges , malformed nuclei , or binuclei Figure 2c are similar to those of cells depleted of MAD2 for several cell divisions.35 Some abnormal nuclei types Types 1 , 2 , and 3 were similar to that of completely BUB1-depleted cells that show significant reduction in CIMD cells and mitotic index with 17-AAG treatment Supplemen-tary Figure S3 left panel and S4 .32 These data indicate that survived cells that escaped CIMD by the addition of p73 siRNA to BUB1 siRNA have abnormal nuclei , suggesting that CIMD eliminates cells prone to substantial chromosome missegregation . This finding strengths our hypothesis that CIMD is an alternative cell death pathway that protects cells from aneuploidy . BUB3 interacts with p73a specifically in cells in which CIMD occurs . We proposed a working hypothesis to describe how partial depletion of BUB1 induces CIMD.31 We assume that there exists a mediator protein X that interacts with BUB1 . Although protein X interacts with BUB1 , it can not associate with p73 when BUB1 is depleted , protein X can bind to p73 to activate its transcriptional activity . As BUB3 is one of the proteins that physically interacts with BUB1,36,37 we tested BUB3 as a candidate for being protein X and studied p73�BUB3 association by immunoprecipitation while introducing defects in the kinetochore�microtubule attachment KT�MT defects by drug treatment . Proteins were precipitated using anti-5 His antibody from HeLa cells co-transfected with 6 His-tagged BUB3 and p73a expres-sion constructs . Taxol-or 17-AAG-treated cells and cells not treated with drugs were examined to detect this interaction . Interestingly , p73a was observed in immunoprecipitates of 6 His-tagged BUB3 from 17-AAG-or Taxol-treated cells , although the level of 6 His-tagged BUB3 was below detectable levels in total lysates Figure 3a left panel Supplementary Figure S6 . In addition , p73a was not precipitated in HeLa cells not treated with drugs Figure 3a , right panel . We confirmed the occurrence of DNA fragmenta-tion by performing TUNEL TdT-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling assay under the same conditions as those in which 6 His-tagged BUB3 and p73a interact Supplementary Figure S5 see the next paragraph . To check BUB3�p73 interaction in a reciprocal manner , we also performed an immunoprecipitation analysis using HeLa cells co-transfected with 6 His-tagged BUB3 and HA-tagged p73a expression constructs , and immunoprecipitated HA-tagged p73a using anti-HA antibody and detected 6 His-tagged BUB3 in the immunoprecipitates Supplementary Figure S7 . Together , these data strongly suggest that BUB3 interacts with p73a specifically in cells in which CIMD occurs . BUB3 is the mediator that induces CIMD . If our model is correct , overexpression of protein X should induce CIMD BUB1 siRNA +17AAG Prophase BUB1 siRNA +17AAG Metaphase Luc siRNA +17AAG Prophase Luc siRNA +17AAG Metaphase when cells are treated with drugs that generate KT�MT defects . Therefore , we overexpressed BUB3 from the Tet promoter in HeLa Tet-Off cells in the absence of tetracycline doxycycline Figure 3b and treated them with 17-AAG or Taxol . As expected , overexpression of BUB3 induced DNA fragmentation TUNEL positive with 17-AAG or Taxol treatment at early mitosis Figure 3c and d . There was no caspase activity caspases 1�10 and 13 in TUNEL-positive cells Figure 3e , data not shown , and caspase inhibitors BAF and zVAD did not inhibit DNA fragmentation induced by 17-AAG and BUB3 overexpression Figure 3f , see the study by Niikura et al32 for drug evaluation controls . Therefore , the mitotic death caused by BUB3 overexpression is caspase independent and thus CIMD . As BUB3 overexpression induces CIMD , we next investi-gated whether BUB3 depletion inhibits CIMD . Although we mBUB1 # 1 mBUB1 # 2 Mitotic cells 20 tried achieving complete depletion of BUB3 using 11 different sets of siRNA data not shown , we could deplete only 70 % of BUB3 Figure 3g , top panel . However , even this partial depletion of BUB3 significantly suppressed CIMD Figure 3g , bottom panel . Furthermore , endogenous BUB3 interacted with p73 when BUB1 was partially depleted Supplementary Figure S8 . These data indicate that BUB3 is the mediator protein inducing CIMD in response to KT�MT defects . p73 isoforms and CIMD . The p73 mRNA exists as several C-terminal splice variants.38�47 As it was difficult to clearly detect endogenous levels of individual isoforms , we first depleted all isoforms by siRNA targeting the common 50-UTR region Figure 4b and confirmed abrogation of CIMD using these siRNA sequences Figure 4c second 3N Type 1 malformed column from the right Supplementary Table S2 . We then expressed each isoform Figure 4a to determine the ones that complemented the function of p73 normal % 20 in CIMD . Interestingly , the expression of a - , b - , and g-isoforms , but not of the e-isoform , induced CIMD Figure 4c . However , under conditions in which CIMD occurs , BUB3 interacted with a - , b - , g - , and e-isoforms Figure 4d , suggest-ing that binding of p73 isoforms to BUB3 is not sufficient to induce CIMD . Tomasini et al.48 described two independent promoters that enable expression of full-length , transcriptionally competent proteins TAp73 isoforms and amino-truncated transcription-ally incompetent proteins DNp73 isoforms . Furthermore , extensive 30 splicings generate further isoforms for each TAp73 and DNp73 isoform.39,48 DNp73 isoforms , by inhibiting the transactivational activity of both TAp73 and p53 , are antiapoptotic and therefore oncogenic.48 We observed that DNp73 a , b , and g suppressed DNA fragmentation in BUB1-depleted cells that were treated with 17-AAG Figure 4e , indicating that DNp73 isoforms inhibit CIMD . Y99 phosphorylation on p73a by c-Abl tyrosine kinase is required for CIMD activation . Previous studies report that when p73 is activated in response to DNA damage , p73 Y99 is phosphorylated by c-Abl human ABL1 tyrosine kinase.49 This phosphorylation is a prerequisite modification for p73 to elicit cell death in fibroblasts.49,50 In our study , phosphorylated Y99 was detected with anti-phospho-p73a Y99 -specific antibody , specifically in 6 His� BUB3 immunoprecipitates Figure 5a Supplementary Figure S6 , indicating that Y99-phosphorylated p73 interacts with BUB3 in cells in which CIMD occurs . To investigate the role of Y99 phosphorylation on p73a in CIMD activation , we constructed an unphosphorylated mutant p73a-Y99A . The p73a-Y99A mutant was expressed at the same level as the wild-type control Figure 5b , top panel , and it significantly suppressed the CIMD induced by BUB3 overexpression plus 17-AAG or Taxol treatment Figure 5b , bottom panel . These data strongly suggest that Y99 phos-phorylation on p73a is required for CIMD activation . As p73 is phosphorylated at Y99 by c-Abl , we examined whether c-Abl is required for CIMD . The depletion of c-Abl Figure 5c , top panel significantly suppressed CIMD Figure 5c , bottom panel . Moreover , c-Abl kinase inhibitors , imatinib and dasatinib , inhibited CIMD Figure 5d . These results indicate that c-Abl tyrosine kinase is required for CIMD , indicating a new role for c-Abl in protecting cells from aneuploidy by inducing programmed cell death that occurs during mitosis . S19 phosphorylation on BUB3 by BUB1 kinase is required for CIMD activation . As BUB1 kinase activity is required to induce CIMD , 32 we hypothesized that BUB3 might be phosphorylated by BUB1 to activate p73 . First , we examined whether BUB1 phosphorylates BUB3 in vitro . We performed BUB1 kinase assay using histone H3 as a positive control Figure 6a and observed that BUB3 was phosphorylated by BUB1 in vitro Figure 6a . Mass spectrometry analysis revealed that BUB3 is phosphorylated at serine-19 S19 by BUB1 in vitro Figure 6b . To confirm whether this phosphorylation occurs in vivo , we performed 2D-gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting . Alkaline phos-phatase treatment of immunopurified BUB3 reduced the intensity of the signal of the dot at the far right of BUB3 Figure 6c , top arrow and circle and middle panels , indicating that this dot is a phosphorylated form of BUB3 . We observed that the corresponding dot was absent in an unphosphorylated mutant BUB3-S19A Figure 6c , bottom panel , suggesting that S19 is phosphorylated in vivo . Importantly , overexpression of wild-type BUB3 but not of the S19A mutant induced CIMD Figure 6d , indicating that S19 phosphorylation on BUB3 is required for CIMD activation . However , the BUB3-S19A mutant protein was able to associate with p73a as the wild-type BUB3 protein , indicating that S19 phosphorylation is not necessary for interaction with p73 Figure 6e . The molecular mechanism involved in the activation of CIMD has not been elucidated to date . Here , we show that overexpressed BUB3 , a BUB1 interactor , interacts with p73 , a structural and functional homolog of the p53 tumor-suppressor protein , specifically in cells in which CIMD occurs . Y99 phosphorylation on p73 by c-Abl tyrosine kinase and S19 phosphorylation on BUB3 by BUB1 kinase are required for CIMD activation . These results strengthen the hypothesis that CIMD protects cells from aneuploidy , which leads to tumorigenesis . Molecular mechanism of activation of CIMD . To explain how partial BUB1 depletion induces CIMD , our initial hypothesis was that BUB1 phosphorylates p73 to activate it , but binding of BUB1 to p73 silences the transcrip-tional activity of p73 . Therefore , a certain level of BUB1 is needed to phosphorylate p73 , but this level should be low enough to release phosphorylated p73 from BUB1 to bind DNA . However , we could not detect the BUB1�p73 interaction by immunoprecipitation under various conditions . Therefore , we proposed another hypothesis that suggests that activated BUB1 binds to mediator protein X and phos-phorylates it.31 According to this model , overexpression of mediator protein X should induce CIMD . Our results clearly demonstrate that BUB3 interacts with p73a specifically Figures 3a and 5a , Supplementary Figures S6�8 and Y99-phosphorylated p73 interacts with BUB3 in cells in which CIMD occurs Figures 5a Supplementary Figures S5 and S6 . Therefore , we conclude that BUB3 is the mediator protein X Figure 7 . A molecular switch should be required to modify BUB3 to activate p73 to induce CIMD conditionally . As BUB1 kinase activity is required to induce CIMD , 32 we tested whether BUB3 is phosphorylated by BUB1 . Serine-19 on BUB3 was phosphorylated by BUB1 in vitro Figure 6a and b and this site was phosphorylated in vivo Figure 6c . Overexpression of an unphosphorylated mutant BUB3-S19A protein , but not BUB3 , failed to induce CIMD , indicating that S19 phosphory-lation is required for CIMD Figure 6d . However , we observed that BUB3-S19A protein was able to bind p73a efficiently Figure 6e . Therefore , there may be additional modification to regulate the BUB3�p73 association . p73 isoforms . Several studies have suggested specific roles for particular p73 isoforms.38,42,48,51,52 The p73 mRNA exists as several C-terminal splice variants.38�47 Tomasini et al.48 described two independent promoters that enable expression of full-length , transcriptionally competent proteins TAp73 isoforms and amino-truncated transcriptionally incompetent proteins DNp73 isoforms . Furthermore , extensive 30 splicings generate further pTRM4-BUB3 pTRM4 vector Prophase Metaphase Vector +17-AAG Prophase Vector +17-AAG Metaphase isoforms for each TAp73 and DNp73 isoform.39,48 Tomasini et al.48 reported that as TAp73 isoforms can transactivate similar proapoptotic genes , such as p53 , they can act as tumor suppressors however , DNp73 isoforms , by inhibiting the transactivational activity of both TAp73 and p53 , are cells 80 60 FLICA-positive 40 20 cells 40 0 vector vector vector vector vector vector vector pTRM4-BUB3 pTRM4-BUB3 pTRM4-BUB3 pTRM4-BUB3 pTRM4-BUB3 pTRM4-BUB3 pTRM4-BUB3 pTRM4 pTRM4 pTRM4 pTRM4 pTRM4 pTRM4 pTRM4 antiapoptotic and therefore oncogenic.48 The first study of p73-deficient mice Trp73 by Yang et al.53 showed that they have neurological , pheromonal , and inflammatory defects but lack spontaneous tumors . However , Flores et al.54 reported that p73 ? � mice had spontaneous tumors , and 6 of 10 p73� � mice had spontaneous lung adeno-carcinoma , which is not consistent with the findings of Yang et al.53 A recent study also showed that mice specifically lacking TAp73 isoforms exhibit spontaneous and carcinogen-induced tumors , infertility , and aging , as well as hippocampal dysgenesis.52 Interestingly , cells from TAp73 mice exhibit genomic instability associated with enhanced aneuploidy , which may explain the increased incidence of spontaneous tumors in these mutants . Therefore , TAp73 isoforms have a tumor-suppressive role and Trp73 may be involved in maintaining genomic stability . We used siRNA sequences targeting the p73a isoform and confirmed the reduction of p73a by RT-PCR Supplementary Figure S2 Figure 4b . As it was difficult to confirm the specific depletion of each isoform , we expressed each isoform when all isoforms were depleted Figure 4a and b . Interestingly , overexpression of a - , b - , and g-but not the e-isoform was sufficient to induce CIMD Figure 4c . However , a - , b - , g - , and e-isoforms interacted with BUB3 Figure 4d . The e-isoform bound to BUB3 but could not induce CIMD , suggesting that specific regions of a - , b - , and g-isoforms are important for CIMD activation . Further analysis is required to determine these specific domains and their functions . We also observed that DNp73 isoforms inhibit TAp73 forms in CIMD activation p73 , the spindle checkpoint , and aneuploidy . We observed that under the conditions in which CIMD occurs , p73 interacts with BUB3 but not with BUB1 . However , very recently , Vernole et al.57 reported that p73a binds to BUB1 and BUB3 in colchicine-treated cells , and Tomasini et al.58 observed that p73a interacts with BUBR1 and a C-terminal fragment of BUB1 interacts with p73a in nocodazole-treated cells . We do not know the reason for this disparity , but the fact that they used the conditions under which CIMD occurred in our studies could be an important factor . For example , both studies overexpressed these proteins to study interactions in the presence of microtubule inhibitors , 57,58 and we know that overexpression of BUB3 causes CIMD when cells are treated with microtubule inhibitors . Tomasini et al.52 also report a putative function of p73 in the spindle checkpoint activity however , the premature mitotic exit that they observed in nocodazole-treated TAp73� � cells was minor compared with that seen in authentic spindle checkpoint mutant depleted cells . This minor defect can be explained by loss of CIMD in p73 knockdown cells Figure 2 . Further analysis is required to clarify these issues . Defects in the spindle checkpoint can promote aneuploidy , and an altered checkpoint is common in tumor cells.3,12 Various mutations have been identified in spindle checkpoint components , 3,12 but no correlation has been established -myc-6xHis -myc-6xHis -myc-6xHis -myc-6xHis TAp73 100 Vector -myc-6xHis -myc-6xHis siRNA Luc between mutations and protein function . Some studies have found that levels of checkpoint components are different in tumor and normal cells , 59�62 but there is no consensus on whether levels of specific proteins increase or decrease in tumor cells and how altered expressions affect the spindle checkpoint function . Our results and previous studies suggest that the expression and balance in levels of BUB1 and BUB3 are important to induce CIMD.32,63 Thus , it would be interesting to detect the balances of these proteins in cancer cells . p73 Y99 phosphorylation and the role of c-Abl in CIMD . Tyrosine kinase c-Abl is the cellular proto-oncogenic counterpart of oncogenic BCR�ABL , 64,65 which is the fusion gene product of the Philadelphia Ph chromosome generated from a reciprocal translocation between chromosome 9 containing the tyrosine kinase c-Abl and chromosome 22 with the BCR gene t [ 9 22 ] .66,67 BCR�ABL tyrosine kinase activity is essential to induce in vitro cellular transformation68 and in vivo leukemogenesis.69,70 Deregulated activity of BCR�ABL tyrosine kinase is responsible for the development of 90 % of chronic myelogenous leukemia cases and 5�15 % of acute B-cell lymphoblastic leukemias.71 The c-Abl protein is also activated by certain DNA-damaging agents72 and can induce programmed cell death apoptosis through p53-dependent and p53-independent mechanisms.73 The p73 protein is regulated by tyrosine kinase c-Abl in the apoptotic response to DNA damage.49 In our study , Y99-phosphorylated p73 interacted with BUB3 in cells in which CIMD occurs Figure 5a Supplementary Figures S5 and S6 in addition , expression of the p73a-Y99A mutant significantly suppressed CIMD induced by BUB3 overexpression plus drug treatment Figure 5b and c-Abl tyrosine kinase and its activity were required for CIMD Figure 5c and d . These data support the idea that c-Abl has an important role in inducing programmed cell death during mitosis . In vivo function of CIMD . Jeganathan et al.63 generated a series of mutant mice with a gradient of reduced Bub1 expression , using wild-type , hypomorphic , and knockout alleles . They observed that Bub1-hypomorphic , but not Bub1-haploinsufficient , mice are highly susceptible to spontaneous tumors . We speculate that the loss of generation of spontaneous tumors in Bub1-haploinsufficient mice may be due to CIMD . This hypothesis should be tested using mouse embryonic fibroblast MEF cells derived from Bub1 mutant mice63,74 and determining whether CIMD occurs . If spontaneous tumor-igenesis in Bub1 ? � mice is suppressed by CIMD , then reduction or deletion of p73 in Bub1 ? � mice should increase spontaneous tumorigenesis . These genetic analyses will determine the in vivo function of CIMD . Caspase-independent mitotic death has also been observed to be dependent on AIF and Endo G , which are effectors of caspase-independent cell death , 33 and EndoG and Aif double-knockout mice can be used to test whether CIMD prevents tumorigenesis . Physio-logical studies on CIMD in mouse models can help determine the in vivo function of CIMD . Antibodies and reagents .

HeLa Tet-Off cells were transiently transfected with 100 Flag-BUB3 S19A Flag-BUB3 wt Vector Mitotic cells 20 BUB1 depletion Figure 7 Model describing the molecular mechanism of CIMD induction . KT�MT defects activate BUB1 . The activated BUB1 binds to BUB3 and phosphory-lates it on serine 19 S19 . The phosphorylated BUB3 can not bind to p73 while it is bound to BUB1 . However , p73 has to be phosphorylated on tyrosine 99 Y99 by c-Abl kinase to interact with phosphorylated and BUB1-released BUB3 . When BUB1 is partially depleted or BUB3 is overexpressed under the KT�MT defect , BUB3 can bind to p73 to activate its transcriptional activity and then induce CIMD pTRM4 overexpression vector , the transcription of which was regulated by the TRE promoter , and cultured in the absence of tetracycline doxycycline .

20057504	A Dunkle1 , I Dzhagalov1 and Y-W He* , 1 T lymphocytes are a dynamic population that depends on the careful regulation of apoptotic pathways for both its establish-ment and maintenance . In the thymus , hematopoietic precursors undergo a multistage developmental program , in which cells progress from the immature CD4 CD8 double-negative DN stage , through the CD4 ? CD8 ? double-positive DP stage , to CD4 ? CD8 or CD4 CD8 ? single-positive SP stages before exiting the thymus into the peripheral T-cell pool . During this process , thymocytes undergo multiple selection steps to ensure that a functional , non-self-reactive T-cell receptor TCR is expressed on the cell surface . Classical apoptotic pathways have essential roles in thymic selection and peripheral responses , with critical implications for autoimmunity and homeostasis.1 Bcl-2 family proteins , which are mediators of the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis , are defined by sharing one or more of four Bcl-2 homology BH domains and can be subdivided into the following three subgroups by structure and function multidomain antiapoptotic proteins , multidomain proapoptotic proteins , and proapoptotic BH3-only proteins.2 The antiapop-totic proteins , namely Bcl-2 , Mcl-1 , Bcl-xL , Bcl-w , and A1 , share multiple BH regions and inhibit proapoptotic family members through interactions between BH domains . Pro-apoptotic Bak and Bax , which contain BH1-3 regions , form homo-oligomeric pores in the mitochondrial membrane and are critical for the release of cytochrome c and downstream events , such as activation of Apaf-1 and effector caspases.3,4 BH3-only proteins function as sensors of apoptotic stimuli and induce apoptosis either by directly activating Bak and Bax �activators� or by binding antiapoptotic proteins �sensitizers� , although the extent to which they have these different roles in vivo is still unclear.5�11 Genetic mouse models have suggested distinct roles for antiapoptotic proteins in T lymphocytes . Bcl-2 thymocyte development is normal at early postnatal time points , but T cells in both the periphery and the thymus are lost by 4 weeks of age , likely because of differences in Bcl-2 dependency between fetal liver and bone marrow-derived hematopoietic progenitors.12�15 However , Bcl-xL is not required for T-cell development , effector function or memory , although Bcl-x DP thymocytes have reduced survival under some conditions.16�18 Mcl-1 is required for thymocyte progression past the DN stage and is also required for SP cells to reach maturation and for survival of naive and activated peripheral T cells.19,20 Mcl-1 , Bcl-2 , and Bcl-xL are each expressed in a unique pattern in thymocytes . Mcl-1 is expressed in all thymocyte subsets.19,20 Bcl-2 is expressed in both DN and SP stages , but downregulated in DP until positive selection.21�23 Con-versely , Bcl-xL , the predominant splice product of the Bcl-x gene in thymocytes , exhibits high expression at DP but low expression at DN and SP.16,24 Given that Mcl-1 and Bcl-2 are expressed in DN and SP thymocytes , 20�23 it was intriguing that loss of Mcl-1 alone did not allow survival past these stages.19,20 As Bcl-2 thymocytes show a similar defect , 12�15 it seems that both Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 are singly required for survival past the DN stage . This raised the question of whether Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 have distinct molecular roles in thymocytes . To assess this , we generated genetic models to dissect the mechanisms of Mcl-1 activity . These studies will not only yield insight into mechanisms of thymocyte survival but also have implications for understanding how different types of Bcl-2 family members regulate apoptosis in vivo . Results Genetic models for dissecting the roles of Mcl-1 . We previously developed an Mcl-1 deletion model in which exon 1 of the Mcl-1 gene was flanked by loxP recombination sites to create �floxed� mice Mcl-1f f .25 To achieve deletion at different stages in thymic development , these mice were crossed with mice in which Cre recombinase is expressed under the proximal Lck promoter , which allows efficient deletion by the DN3 stage , or mice expressing Cre under the CD4 promoter enhancer , which deletes by DP.20,26 Mcl-1-deficient lines were crossed with Bcl-2-transgenic Bcl-2tg , 27 Bak , 28 Bax , 29 or Bim 30 mice to build a genetic pathway for Mcl-1 activity and determine the in vivo interactions of these proteins in thymocytes . Overexpression of Bcl-2 can not rescue Mcl-1-deficient thymocytes . Previous observations from Mcl-1-deficient models implied that Mcl-1 and Bcl-2 have distinct roles at the DN stage . Alternatively , the possibility remained that endogenous levels of Bcl-2 were insufficient to rescue the loss of Mcl-1 . To investigate these possibilities , we crossed Mcl-1f fCre mice with mice that overexpress Bcl-2 as a transgene under the H-2Kb promoter , yielding high expression in all hematopoietic cells.27 Flow cytometry confirmed expression of the Bcl-2 transgene in DN , DP , and SP thymocytes in our system data not shown . In these and previous experiments , Mcl-1f fLckCre mice exhibited a dramatic reduction B90 % in total thymocyte number attributed to a block at DN , specifically an accumula-tion at the CD44 ? CD25 ? DN2 and CD44 CD25 ? DN3 stages Figure 1 .20 A similarly profound loss in thymocyte number was observed in Mcl-1f fLckCreBcl-2tg mice com-pared with both Bcl-2tg and wild-type controls Figure 1a . In spite of increased thymic cellularity in Bcl-2tg control mice , Mcl-1f fLckCreBcl-2tg total cell numbers were not significantly different from those of Mcl-1f fLckCre mice Figure 1a . As previously observed , the thymic profile of Mcl-1f fLckCre mice showed a skewing toward the DN compartment at the expense of DP Figure 1b , upper panel . Although the Bcl-2 transgene alone increased DN percentage , the block at DN is also observable in Mcl-1f fLckCreBcl-2tg mice Figure 1b , upper panel . In addition , the block at the DN2�DN3 stages is still observed in Mcl-1f fLckCreBcl-2tg mice Figure 1b . As different thymic subsets may have different apoptotic mechanisms , we examined whether Bcl-2 overexpression could rescue survival of Mcl-1-deficient SP thymocytes and peripheral T cells . We previously showed that Mcl-1f fCD4Cre mice have normal cellularity in the thymus and spleen , but a marked reduction in mature SP cells as defined by the expression of TCRb and the markers Qa2 and CD69 mature SP cells ? TCRb ? Qa2 ? CD69lo , as well as both CD4 ? and CD8 ? T cells in the periphery.20 Similarly , Mcl-1f fCD4CreBcl-2tg mice exhibited a loss of T cells in the spleen , although the percentage was consistently higher than Mcl-1f fCD4Cre Figure 1c-i . Similar to Mcl-1f fCD4Cre mice , the thymic profile of Mcl-1f fCD4CreBcl-2tg mice showed a reduction in the percentage of CD4 ? and CD8 ? SP cells Figure 1c-ii and in the percentage of TCRb ? cells in SP compartments Figure 1c-iii CD4 ? SP and 1c-iv CD8 ? SP . However , within the CD4 ? TCRb ? and CD8 ? TCRb ? SP compartments , Mcl-1f f CD4CreBcl-2tg had higher proportions in the mature gate than did Mcl-1f fCD4Cre Figure 1c-iii and c-iv . Cell numbers of mature CD4 ? and CD8 ? SP cells in Mcl-1f fCD4CreBcl-2tg mice were also increased , but were still significantly lower than Bcl-2tg controls Figure 1d . The same was true for both CD4 ? and CD8 ? T cells in the spleen Figure 1e . As Bcl-2tg mice have elevated total cell numbers in both the thymus and the spleen , we compared the percentages of mature SP cells in the thymus and T cells in the spleen . For CD4 ? SP cells , there was an increase in the mean percentage of mature SP cells in the thymus of Mcl-1f f CD4CreBcl-2tg mice from that of Mcl-1f fCD4Cre mice , although the percentage was significantly lower than that of Bcl-2tg control Figure 1f , left . For CD8 ? SP cells , the percentage of mature cells in the thymus was not significantly different from that of Mcl-1f fCD4Cre Figure 1f , right . The same results were observed for CD4 ? and CD8 ? T cells , respectively , in the spleen Figure 1g . These data show that although overexpression of Bcl-2 lends a modest improve-ment to survival of Mcl-1-deficient SP thymocytes and peripheral T cells , particularly CD4 ? cells , there is still a significant impairment in the survival of these cells as the transgene is unable to rescue percentages to wild-type or Bcl-2tg control levels . Bak partially rescues thymocyte defect in Mcl-1f f LckCre mice , whereas Bax can not . One explanation for the nonredundancy of Mcl-1 and Bcl-2 is that these proteins have differential abilities to bind proapoptotic proteins . For example , the BH3-only protein Noxa binds Mcl-1 and A1 but not Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL.6,9 Intriguingly , Bak has been shown to bind Mcl-1 at relatively high affinity , Bcl-xL at a lower affinity , and did not bind Bcl-2 to a detectable level.31 However , a different group recently showed that when the Bak protein as opposed to the Bak BH3 peptide31 was used , Bcl-2 could bind Bak with similar or better affinity than Bcl-xL , although this was somewhat dependent on the variant of Bcl-2.32 Therefore , the in vivo specificity of Bak for Mcl-1 is unclear . To determine whether the death of Mcl-1-deficient thymocytes occurred preferentially through Bak , we crossed Mcl-1f fLckCre mice with Bak and Bax mice . Although some groups , but not others , have observed a mild expansion in total cellularity of the Bax thymus , 29,33 we observed no differences between wild-type and Bak or Bax single knockouts not shown , and therefore all Cre-negative genotypes are represented as controls in our experiments . Total thymocyte numbers in Mcl-1f fLckCreBak mice were significantly increased over Mcl-1f fLckCreBak ? , although the numbers did not reach control levels Figure 2a . Mcl-1f fLckCreBak ? mice were identical to age-matched Mcl-1f fLckCre mice data not shown . Thymic cellularity of Mcl-1f fLckCreBax mice was no different from that of Mcl-1f fLckCre Figure 2b . To determine which stages of thymocyte development were rescued , we compared cellularity in different thymic subsets . Mcl-1f fLckCreBak mice had equivalent DN thymocyte numbers to control mice Figure 2c , upper row , but in subsequent developmental subsets , cellularity in Mcl-1f fLckCreBak mice did not reach that of controls . However , there was a significant increase in Mcl-1f fLckCreBak cell numbers over Mcl-1f fLckCreBak ? in all subsets except for CD8 ? SP , indicating some persistence of rescued cells into later stages Figure 2c , upper row . Cell numbers in Mcl-1f fLckCreBax mice were not different from those in Mcl-1f fLckCre mice for any subset Figure 2c , lower row . FACS profiling of the Mcl-1f fLckCreBak thymus re-vealed increased DP percentage and decreased DN percen-tage compared with the Mcl-1f fLckCreBak ? profile Figure 2d . Consistent with a partial rescue , Mcl-1f f LckCreBak had a higher percentage of CD44 CD25 DN4 cells than did Mcl-1f fLckCreBak ? , but the increased percentage at the DN3 stage was not completely relieved Figure 2d . Mcl-1f fLckCreBax showed no relief in the DN block as observable by the percentage of DN DP or the DN profile Figure 2e . In fact , in most experiments , Mcl-1f f LckCreBax contained higher percentages in the DN gate than did Mcl-1f fLckCreBax ? , although Bax alone has no such increase.33 Finally , we examined Mcl-1 protein levels in thymocyte subsets to confirm that Mcl-1f fLckCreBak thymocytes have not retained Mcl-1 expression . We previously showed that we were able to specifically detect Mcl-1 protein by flow cytometry.20 Owing to differences in background isotype control levels between thymic subsets , relative Mcl-1 levels are displayed as a ratio of the mean fluorescence intensity of the Mcl-1 stain to that of the isotype control for each subset . Mcl-1f fLckCreBak ? thymocytes contain wild-type levels of Mcl-1 , likely because surviving thymocytes have escaped deletion of Mcl-1 Figure 2f . This is consistent with previous results shown by western blot or PCR in Mcl-1f fLckCre mice.19,20 Mcl-1f fLckCreBak thymocytes have a detect-able and statistically significant decrease in the Mcl-1 expression ratio in all major subsets , indicating that these cells have survived without Mcl-1 Figure 2f . No such decrease is detectable in Mcl-1f fLckCreBax , indicating that most of the cells in these mice are those that have escaped deletion Figure 2g . Bak but not Bax rescues survival of Mcl-1f fCD4Cre mature SP thymocytes in a dose-dependent manner . Given the rescue of Mcl-1-deficient DN cells by Bak and that we continued to detect increased cell numbers in later subsets , we sought to determine whether Bak could rescue survival of Mcl-1-deficient mature SP cells . Thymus and spleen samples obtained from Mcl-1f f CD4Cre mice had normal cellularity and this was unaltered by deletion of Bak or Bax Figure 3a . The percentage of T cells in the Mcl-1f fCD4CreBak spleen returned to near control levels , and a partial increase over Mcl-1f fCD4Cre was observed in mice heterozygous for Bak Figure 3b . We observed a return of Qa2 ? CD69lo cells in CD4 ? and CD8 ? SP compartments in both Mcl-1f fCD4CreBak ? and Mcl-1f f CD4CreBak mice Figure 3b . Similar to what was observed with the Bcl-2 transgene , Mcl-1f fCD4CreBax mice exhibited a modest improvement over Mcl-1f fCD4Cre in the percentage of T cells in the spleen and percentage of Qa2 ? CD69lo cells within the already reduced SP compartments Figure 3c . However , this did not match even the Bak ? in the extent of rescue . Bak rescued Mcl-1f fCD4Cre mature CD4 ? and CD8 ? SP cell numbers to wild-type levels and a dose effect was observed in Bak ? mice Figure 3d . The same results were observed in the spleen , although the Bak ? effect was not significant in CD8 ? T cells Figure 3e . Although there was a statistically significant increase in the number of mature CD8 ? SP and CD4 ? and CD8 ? T cells in Mcl-1f fCD4CreBax , the absolute difference in cell numbers was minor , and Mcl-1f f CD4CreBax was significantly different from Mcl-1-sufficient controls for all subsets Figure 3f and g . Loss of Bim does not rescue Mcl-1-deficient thymocytes . One of the proposed roles of antiapoptotic proteins is to inhibit BH3-only proteins , such as Bim , that are capable of directly activating Bak and Bax.7,8 Bim is known to be critical for preventing autoimmunity because of its roles in thymocyte-negative selection and activated T cells.30,34,35 Moreover , it has been shown that loss of Bim can rescue the survival and phenotypic defects of Bcl-2 mice , including thymocyte development.36,37 To determine whether Bim is important for apoptosis of Mcl-1-deficient thymocytes , we crossed Mcl-1f fCD4Cre mice with Bim mice . Although there was no difference between Bim ? ? and Bim ? by our measures , Bim and Mcl-1f fCD4CreBim mice had higher total cell numbers in the spleen and thymus Figure 4a . FACS profiling showed that Bim control mice had normal T-cell percentages in the spleen but increased percentages of Qa2 ? CD69lo mature cells within the SP compartments Figure 4b , compared with Figures 1c and 3b . However , Mcl-1f fCD4CreBim mice showed a similar percentage of mature SP cells and peripheral T cells to Mcl-1f fCD4Cre Figure 4b , compared with Figures 1c and 3b . In spite of increased total cellularity , Mcl-1f fCD4CreBim mice displayed comparable cell numbers to Mcl-1f fCD4CreBim ? in the mature SP Figure 4c and spleen T-cell Figure 4d compartments . Thus , Bim does not seem to have a downstream role in promoting the death of Mcl-1-deficient thymocytes . Discussion By generating various genetic models , we showed that Mcl-1 and Bcl-2 have separate molecular roles at two critical points in thymic development . Overexpression of Bcl-2 was unable to rescue the survival of Mcl-1-deficient thymocytes at either the DN or the SP stage . In addition , although it has been shown that Bim can rescue Bcl-2-deficient thymocytes , 37 Bim was unable to rescue Mcl-1-deficient thymocytes , and thus Bim does not seem to be the downstream effector of cell death in the absence of Mcl-1 . Intriguingly , Bak but not Bax could rescue Mcl-1-deficient thymocytes at both the DN and SP stages , yielding evidence that specific antagonism of Bak may be the major role of Mcl-1 in thymocytes . An in vivo model for Mcl-1 activity in T cells . Two opposing but not necessarily exclusive models have emerged for the mechanism of the antiapoptotic molecules Bcl-2 , Mcl-1 , and Bcl-xL . The �direct-activation model� suggests that antiapoptotic proteins function to inhibit the activity of BH3-only activator proteins Figure 5a .8�10 By this model , certain BH3-only molecules , namely Bim , Bid , and possibly Puma , directly activate Bak and Bax and binding of the antiapoptotic proteins to these BH3-only activators inhibits apoptotic pathways.8�10 Alternatively , under the �Bak Bax sequestration� model , the antiapoptotic proteins function to bind Bak and Bax directly to prevent their oligomerization and or activation Figure 5b .5 By this model , all BH3-only proteins function upstream to affect the ability of antiapoptotic proteins to bind Bak Bax and the distinction between �activators� and �sensitizers� really lies in the differential abilities of the BH3-only proteins to bind antiapoptotic proteins.5,6,31 One limitation of the studies leading to these models is that specific interactions between the Bcl-2 family members have been largely defined using BH3 peptides and were performed in cell lines , 6,31 and further studies are required to examine the in vivo consequences of these interactions . Recent data obtained from knock-in mice expressing mutant forms of Bim suggest that both its ability to bind antiapoptotic proteins indirect activation and its ability to bind Bax direct activation are important for its full apoptotic effects.11 The data we presented in this study allow us to build an in vivo pathway of the roles of Mcl-1 in thymocytes Figure 5c . Our data support previous biochemical data showing specificity at the level of the Mcl-1� Bak interaction.31 Together , these results are supportive of a model in which Mcl-1 directlysequestersBak in thymocytes . We showed that loss of the direct activator Bimdoes not rescue Mcl-1-deficient thymocytes , although this does not rule out the possibility that other BH3-only �activators� may be downstream of Mcl-1 . However , Bid and Puma have both been shown to activate Bax and Bak , 3,10 and our data show that Mcl-1-deficient thymocytes die by a Bak-specific mechanism . Release of BH3-only proteins upon deletion of Mcl-1 may still contribute to the death of thymocytes , particularly in DN cells in which rescue by Bak was incomplete . It is possible that one of these BH3-only proteins could preferentially activate Bak over Bax , either directly or indirectly , by a mechanism that is yet to be appreciated . Future studies should continue to explore which other Bcl-2-family proteins contribute to the death of Mcl-1-deficient cells . However , the robust rescue by Bak is suggestive of a major role of Mcl-1 in thymocytes being that of directly antagonizing Bak . The role of Mcl-1 seems to be slightly different in each thymic subset . In DN cells , Mcl-1 sequesters Bak , and loss of Mcl-1 leads to Bak activation Figure 5c , left . As rescue by Bak is only partial at this stage , it is likely that Mcl-1 also inhibits other apoptotic signals that are less selective for Bak , such as BH3-only proteins that directly activate Bak Bax as shown in Figure 5c . Although our data do not directly address the role of Bcl-2 , published data place Bim genetically down-stream of Bcl-2 , and suggest that the major role of Bcl-2 in thymocytes is to inhibit the activation of Bax and or Bak by Bim Bax activation displayed in Figure 5c . It is likely that Bim functions both directly to activate Bax and indirectly because mutant forms of Bim that can not bind Bax partially alleviate the Bcl-2 phenotype but do not entirely recapitulate the rescue observed with the Bim .11 In data not presented , we observed that Bim does not appear to rescue Mcl-1f f LckCre thymocytes , and therefore Bim alone is unlikely to be responsible for the incomplete rescue of Mcl-1-deficient cells at DN . In DP cells , both Mcl-1 and Bcl-xL can sequester Bak Figure 5c , middle , as suggested by biochemical data31 and our previous data in which DP cells were lost when both Mcl-1 and Bcl-x were deleted.20 It is unclear whether Mcl-1 and Bcl-xL also inhibit Bax in DP thymocytes or whether Bax is inactive at this stage . In SP cells , direct inhibition of Bak seems to be a more dominant role of Mcl-1 because of the extent of rescue by deletion of Bak , even at the heterozygous level Figure 5c , right . As Bcl-2tg and Bax yielded a slight improvement in SP thymocyte survival , Mcl-1 likely also has a minor cooperative role with Bcl-2 in inhibiting Bax Figure 5c , right . As this was not observed in Bim , it could suggest that direct inhibition Bax by Mcl-1 is responsible , although Mcl-1 could inhibit one of the other activator BH3-only proteins for this effect . Although not displayed in Figure 5c for simplicity , upstream BH3-only proteins have important roles in affecting the ability of antiapoptotic proteins to perform the functions displayed . Nonredundancy of Bcl-2 family members . The rescue of Mcl-1-deficient thymocytes by the Bak knockout mice was somewhat surprising considering that Bak and Bax are presumed to be largely redundant.28 Neither Bak nor Bax single knockout mice display a significant phenotype , whereas the double knockout mice have profound defects in several systems , including thymocytes.28,29,33 However , there is some evidence that Bak and Bax , although performing similar functions , may be regulated differently . Under resting conditions , Bak is localized on the mitochondrial membrane , whereas Bax can be found in the cytosol until induction of apoptosis when it relocates to the mitochondrial membrane , coincident with a conformational shift to the active form and multimerization.38�40 Although hard evidence is still required , on a conceptual level , this could allow for Bak and Bax to be subjected to different regulatory mechanisms . In addition , although our study focuses on the roles of the Bcl-2 family members , other proteins may affect the activity of Bak and or Bax . Mitochondrial protein VDAC2 has been shown to bind monomeric Bak in the mitochondrial membrane and contribute to the susceptibility of cells to apoptosis through Bak.41,42 Specific roles for Mcl-1 in different cell types . It was interesting that we observed a more complete rescue of Mcl-1-deficient thymocytes by Bak in SP cells than in DN cells , indicating that even between different thymic subsets , the dominant activity of Mcl-1 is different . Similarly , the minor rescue observed in Bcl-2tg and Bax SP thymocytes was more evident in CD4 ? cells than in CD8 ? cells , indicating that CD4 ? and CD8 ? cells may have a different balance between Mcl-1-specific and Mcl-1 Bcl-2-shared pathways . Recently , a mouse model was published in which specific promoter regions of Mcl-1 were mutated leading to reduced expression of Mcl-1 in thymocytes and peripheral T cells.43 The phenotype in this hypomorphic mouse was more severe in CD8 ? cells than in CD4 ? T cells , correlating well with our data that CD8 ? cell survival was not improved by Bax or Bcl-2tg . These data suggest that CD8 ? T cells are more exclusively dependent on Mcl-1 cells than are CD4 ? T cells . In addition to T cells , Mcl-1 is required for neutrophil survival.25 Interestingly , it was recently published that the Bak Bax double knockout rescued Mcl-1-deficient neutrophil survival , but unlike what we observed in thymocytes , the authors stated that neither Bak nor Bax knockout alone rescued it.44 Mcl-1-deficient neutrophils were not rescued by Bim , but Bim could rescue activated Mcl-1-deficient macrophages in their system.44 The reasons for differences in the roles of Mcl-1 between different cell types are not yet clear . However , as the balance between antiapoptotic and proapoptotic factors is what ultimately determines cell fate , a likely contributor would be differences in expression and activity of other Bcl-2 family members between cell types . Upstream BH3-only proteins inhibit antiapoptotic proteins and can combine to sensitize the cell toward certain stimuli . For example , although neither Noxa nor Bad alone could cause apoptosis in certain experimental systems , the coexpression of these proteins or their BH3 regions led to cell death.6,31 Bad has been shown to bind Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL but not Mcl-1 directly , whereas Noxa binds Mcl-1 and A1 but not Bcl-xL or Bcl-2.6 Thus , Bad could indirectly influence the role of Mcl-1 in that the more Bad activity there is in a cell , the less Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL are able to perform shared roles with Mcl-1 and the more susceptible the cell becomes to loss of Mcl-1 protein or function . In addition , the activity of Noxa , which inhibits Mcl-1 , is likely to have a large role in determining the availability of Mcl-1 to perform its specific roles as well as shared roles with Bcl-2 . As biochemical pathways are further defined , it will be important to consider that each cell type and condition may have a different balance of Bcl-2 family members . Given the importance of the Bcl-2 family in lymphoid and other systems , as well as the current interest in this family as targets of cancer therapy , it will be critical to continue to delineate roles of antiapoptotic proteins in vivo in different cell types .

20075939	J Liang1 , Y-J Wang1 , Y Tang1 , N Cao1 , J Wang1 and H-T Yang* , 1,2,3 signals . Embryonic stem ES cells , derived from the inner cell mass of preimplantation embryo , 1,2 are pluripotent cells having the ability to differentiate into derivatives of all three germ layers endoderm , mesoderm , and ectoderm in vitro.1,3 Such differentiation is concomitant with the reduction of proliferation and the occurrence of spontaneous apoptosis , 4,5 an essential process for the formation of cavities during embryogenesis in vivo.6 Thus , ES cells recapitulating the early stages of lineage differentiation and spontaneous apoptosis represent an appropriate model to study the regulatory mechanisms underlying early embryogenesis.7 Intracellular Ca2 ? oscillation has crucial roles in regulation of various cellular processes including proliferation , 8,9 differ-entiation , 10�12 and apoptosis.8,13 Cells generate their Ca2 ? signals by using both internal and external sources of Ca2 ? . Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors IP3Rs are predomi-nant intercellular Ca2 ? release channels on the internal Ca2 ? store endoplasmic reticulum ER and have important roles in www.nature.com cdd the regulation of cellular behaviors through generation of spatially and temporally signal patterns of cytosolic free Ca2 ? concentration [ Ca2 ? ] i . Three days after withdrawal of leukemia inhibitory factor LIF , approximately 30 % of differentiated mouse m ES cells die by apoptosis.5 Blocking this spontaneous apoptosis by a p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibitor leads to an alteration of expression of differentiation markers and increased expression of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 , Bcl-XL , and Ca2 ? -binding pro-teins , 14 indicating an important role of a correct apoptotic process in the regulation of ES cell differentiation and a possible role of Ca2 ? signals in the regulation of apoptosis . Indeed , in many other cell types , such as lymphocytes or HEK293 , Ca2 ? signals regulated by IP3Rs have been reported as a pro-apoptotic13,15 or an anti-apoptotic mediator when anti-apoptotic factor Bcl-XL is expressed.16,17 However , the precise role of IP3Rs in the regulation of apoptosis during early ES cell differentiation is unknown . There are three subtypes of IP3Rs in mammalian cells , sharing high similarity 70�80 % in their primary sequences , but expressing to varying degrees in individual cell types and differing in molecular properties in many respects such as affinities for IP3 and Ca2 ? .18,19 Type 1 IP3R IP3R1 is predominantly expressed in brain tissue20 and has a critical role in brain functions21 and neural development.22 The other two subtypes , type 2 and 3 IP3R IP3R2 and IP3R3 , are expressed in various tissues and cell lines , 19 but their exact functions are difficult to assess because of their co-expression in tissues and the lack of selective inhibitors . Several pieces of evidence have shown that early embryonic development is disrupted by pharmacological10,12 or antibody blockages11 of IP3Rs and phospholipase C , suggesting that IP3-induced Ca2 ? release is required for the early embryonic development in vertebrates . However , it is not clear to what extent the distinct IP3R subtypes contribute to the complex Ca2 ? signals during embryogenesis . Recent studies showed that the expression level of IP3R3 increases after fertilization in zebrafish , 12 indicating a possible involvement of IP3R3 in the regulation of Ca2 ? signaling during early embryo development . IP3R3 is also detected in mES cells23,24 and it has been shown to mediate Ca2 ? oscillations related to cell cycle regulation.24 However , little is known regarding the exact function of IP3R3 in undifferentiated and differentiating ES cells . In this study , combining with specific RNA interference small interfering RNA siRNA and overexpression of IP3R3 , we analyzed the expression profile and roles of IP3R3 during early differentiating mES cells . Our results have revealed novel roles of IP3R3 in the regulation of intracellular Ca2 ? oscillations and the biophysical functions in the apoptosis of early differentiating ES cells and the subsequent cell lineage commitment . Results Expression patterns of IP3R3 in undifferentiated and differentiating ES cells . We first tested differentiating mES cell cultures for the expression profile of IP3R3 . As shown in Figure 1a , the expression of IP3R3 mRNA and protein was higher in undifferentiated ES cells , while the expression levels decreased by 45 % in mRNA and by 60 % in protein at the first day of differentiation on withdrawal of LIF and feeder layers , and then gradually returned to the level observed in the undifferentiated ES cells around differentiation day 7 , suggesting an important role of IP3R3 during ES cell differentiation . Characteristics of IP3R3�siRNA siIP3R3 ES cell lines . To identify the role of IP3R3 , we then generated stable mES cell lines with downregulated expression of IP3R3 by siRNA against IP3R3 siIP3R3a , Figure 1b RT-PCR and western blot analysis showed that the negative control siRNA against enhanced green fluorescent protein siEGFP did not affect the expression of three subtypes of IP3Rs , while the siIP3R3a inhibited the expression of IP3R3 but not IP3R1 and IP3R2 . Compared with the wild-type wt or siEGFP ES cells , the expression of IP3R3 in siIP3R3a mES cell lines clones 4 and 2 was decreased by 40�50 % at the RNA level Figure 1c , left panel and by 75�80 % at the protein level Figure 1c , right panel . During differentiation processes , the expression pattern of IP3R3 in IP3R3-knockdown cells clones 2 and 4 was similar to that in control cells , although the expression levels at each time point examined were much lower than those of the control cells Supplementary Figure 1 . To determine whether IP3R3 regulates self-renewal , proliferation , and apoptosis in ES cells , we compared these characteristics between undifferentiated wt and siIP3R3a ES cells . No significant differences in the alkaline phosphatase ALP activity Figure 2a and in the transcripts of pluripotency markers Oct-4 , Nanog , and Rex-1 Figure 2b were detected among undifferentiated wt , siEGFP , and siIP3R3a ES cells . Western blot and flow cytometry analysis further confirmed that the expression levels of pluripotency markers Oct-4 and stage-specific embryonic antigen 1 SSEA-1 were similar among these cells Figure 2c . In addition , MTT assay showed that undifferentiated siIP3R3a ES cells had similar cell viability as wt and siEGFP cells Figure 3a , left panel . Taken together , these data suggest that IP3R3 knockdown does not affect the self-renewal of ES cells . IP3R3 regulates apoptosis in differentiating ES cells . We then analyzed the roles of IP3R3 during the spontaneous differentiation process . Compared with the wt and siEGFP ES cells , differentiating siIP3R3a ES cells had lower cell viability during examination on differentiation days 3 to 6 Figure 3a , right panel . This was consistent with the decreased population of siIP3R3a ES cells observed on differentiation day 3 Figure 3b . To determine the basis of this growth defect , we then analyzed the changes in proliferation and apoptosis in the differentiating cells . The numbers of bromodeoxyuridine BrdU -labeled cells in wt , siEGFP , and two siIP3R3a cell lines on differentiation day 3 were not significantly different when examined by confocal microscopy Figure 3c and flow cytometry analysis Figure 3d . Flow cytometry analysis of each cell line on propidium iodide PI staining revealed no difference in cell cycle distribution among the cell lines , although the percentage of cells in S�G2�M stages gradually decreased on differentiation Figure 3e . These data show that IP3R3 downregulation decreases cell viability without affecting cell proliferation rates . To determine whether the lower viability observed in the differentiating siIP3R3a ES cells is related to the increased apoptosis in early ES cell differentiation , we then compared apoptotic parameters among wt , siEGFP , and siIP3R3a ES cells . Annexin V an early apoptosis marker -FITC staining analysis showed similar apoptotic rates B6 % among undifferentiated cell lines , while apoptotic cells increased in siEGFP cells at differentiation day 3 and further increased in both siIP3R3a cell lines compared with wt and siEGFP cells at differentiation day 3 Figure 4a . Terminal deoxynucleotidyl-transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling TUNEL staining assay also showed that the siIP3R3a cells had up to twofold increases in apoptosis compared with the wt and siEGFP cells at differentiation day 3 Figure 4b . The findings suggest that IP3R3 downregulation does not affect the IP3R3 ? -actin proliferation potential of differentiating ES cells , but it leads to an increase in apoptosis during differentiation , thereby conferring a growth defect on siIP3R3a cells . It has been shown that spontaneous apoptosis observed in differentiating mES cells is associated with the cleavage of caspase-3.5,14 We thus evaluated caspase-3 activity by CaspACETM colorimetric assay system and western blot analysis . The siIP3R3a cells had higher activities of caspase-3 Figure 4c , left panel as well as more total and cleaved caspase-3 proteins on differentiation day 3 Figure 4c , right panel . The expression of other apoptotic marker proteins , Bax and puma a , and release of cytochrome c , the factors involved in mitochondrial apoptosis pathway , were also increased in siIP3R3a cells on differentiation day 3 Figure 4d . ? -actin To further confirm the role of IP3R3 in the apoptosis of differentiating ES cells , we transiently transfected mES cells with another IP3R3-specific siRNA siIP3R3b25 and wt IP3R3-overexpressing vectors IP3R3wt Figure 4e . Consistent with the observation in siIP3R3a cells , siIP3R3b cells had more Annexin V ? Figure 4f and TUNEL ? cells Figure 4g compared with the control siEGFP cells on differentiation day 3 . In contrast , the cells expressing IP3R3wt rat wt IP3R3 inserted into pCB6 vector had less apoptosis compared with the cells transfected with control pCB6 vector Figures 4f and g . Alteration of cytosolic Ca2 ? signals generated by IP3R3 knockdown leads to increased apoptosis . We further examined the mechanism of increased apoptosis in siIP3R3 cells . As IP3Rs is a Ca2 ? release channel on ER and other intracellular organelles , 19 we measured spontaneous [ Ca2 ? ] i oscillations in undifferentiated and differentiating ES cells . The [ Ca2 ? ] i oscillation patterns were similar between siEGFP control and siIP3R3a undifferentiated ES cells Supplementary Figure 2 . However , the Ca2 ? signal patterns were markedly different between the control and siIP3R3a differentiating cells . In control cells , Ca2 ? oscillations were sharp with lower frequency Figure 5b , left panel , whereas siIP3R3a cells showed much more robust and long-lasting Ca2 ? oscillations with higher baseline [ Ca2 ? ] i Figures 5a and b , right panel . The averaged baseline , incidence , and intensity of [ Ca2 ? ] i oscillations in siIP3R3a cells were much higher than those of control cells Figure 5b . These data suggest that IP3R3 has an important role in maintaining a proper pattern of cytosolic Ca2 ? signals in early differentiating cells . To further determine whether IP3R3 knockdown-increased [ Ca2 ? ] i oscillations would promote apoptosis , we examined the apoptosis of differentiating ES cells after chelating cytosolic free Ca2 ? by addition of 1,2-bis 2-aminophenoxy ethane-N , N , N 0 , N 0-tetraacetic acid-acetoxymethyl ester BAPTA-AM . BAPTA-AM decreased the total and cleaved caspase-3 in a dose-dependent manner in siIP3R3a cells , whereas it increased cleaved caspase-3 in siEGFP cells on differentiation day 3 Figure 5c . Consistently , BAPTA-AM treatment decreased TUNEL-positive cells in differentiating siIP3R3 cells , whereas it increased TUNEL-positive cells in siEGFP cells Figure 5d . These findings suggest that cytosolic Ca2 ? signals regulated by IP3R3 might have crucial roles in the regulation of apoptosis during mES cell differentiation . Knockdown of IP3R3 impairs in vitro differentiation of the mesoderm and endoderm . To analyze whether IP3R3 also affects lineage-specific differentiation , the siIP3R3a cells were induced to differentiate into three primary germ layers and their derivatives by the formation of embryoid bodies EBs . The EBs formed from siIP3R3a cells were smaller than those formed from wt or siEGFP cells after 2-day hanging drop culture Figure 6a , day 2 . However , after suspension culture for another 4 days , the siIP3R3a EBs swelled and became much larger than the control ones Figure 6a , day 6 . The Q-PCR analysis showed that the expression of undifferentiated marker genes Oct-4 and Rex-1 gradually decreased during ES cell differentiation , but without difference among the wt , siEGFP , and two siIP3R3a cell lines Figure 6b . It is noteworthy that the expression patterns of early endodermal markers Gata4 and Gata6 , and ectodermal markers Fgf5 and nestin in siIP3R3a cells were similar to those in wt and siEGFP ES cells Figure 6b . However , the expressions of early mesodermal or mesendodermal markers brachyury T , goosecoid Gsc , Flk1 , and Hand1 were much lower in siIP3R3a cells than in control cells in the indicated days Figure 6c . Next , we compared the in vitro differentiation of neuronal cells ectoderm , cardiomyocytes , adipocytes , and cartilage cells mesoderm , and endodermal cell types from wt , siEGFP , and two lines of siIP3R3 cells . The expression of neuronal-specific markers26 microtubule-associated protein 2 MAP2 as well as class III-tubulin Tuj1 and neurofilament genes NF-M remained unchanged after IP3R3 knockdown Supplementary Figure 3a . It was further confirmed by immunofluorescence analysis of MAP2 and Tuj1 that down-regulation of IP3R3 did not affect the neuronal differentiation Supplementary Figure 3b . As expected , the percentage of contracting EBs charac-teristics of cardiomyocytes was much lower in IP3R3-knock-down cells than in wt and siEGFP cells Figure 7a . Similarly , the expressions of genes encoding the early cardiac transcription factors myocyte enhancer factor 2C Mef2c and NK2 transcription factor Nkx2.5 as well as cardiac cytoskeletal proteins myosin heavy chain a aMHC and myosin light chain-2v MLC-2v were significantly lower in siIP3R3a cells compared with those in control cells MTT 0.5 80 positive % 60 40 cells BrdU 20 of 100 Figure 7b . The immunofluorescence analysis confirmed much higher expression levels of cardiac cytoskeletal protein a-actinin and MLC-2v in wt and siEGFP EBs than in the siIP3R3a ones Figure 7c . In addition , to determine whether siIP3R3 ES cells can differentiate into Flk1 mesodermal lineages other than cardiomyocytes from Flk1 ? mesodermal lineages , ES cells were induced to differentiate into adipogenic or chondrogenic lineage from Flk1 meso-dermal lineages.27 Alican blue-positive cartilage cells Supplementary Figure 4a , upper panel or Oil red O-positive adipogenic cells Supplementary Figure 4a , lower panel were observed on differentiation day 21 in both types of cells . However , chondrogenic and adipogenic differentiation was less efficient in siIP3R3 cells compared with that in control cells . Consistently , the expression of chondrogenic marker # 4 # 4 * cells 200 ? -actin IP3R3 ? -actin 150 ** Ca 2.5 min genes sox9 28 and collagen II 29 Col2a1 Supplementary Figure 4b , left panel and adipogenic marker genes peroxi - some proliferator-activated g PPARg and adiponectin30 Supplementary Figure 4b , right panel was much lower in siIP3R3 cells compared with that in control cells . Thus , downregulation of IP3R3 affects the expression of early mesodermal markers and the subsequent differentiation of mesodermal lineages . For endodermal differentiation , we examined the expres-sion of hepatic cell marker genes26 cytokeratin 8 CK8 , hepatocyte nuclear factor 3 b HNF3b , a-fetoprotein , and albumin 1 AlB1 Figure 7d , left panel as well as visceral endodermal markers Syndecan-431 sdc4 , tmpress2,32 and disabled-233 Dab-2 Figure 7d , right panel . The mRNA levels of AFP , AlB1 , and Dab-2 decreased in siIP3R3 cells compared with those in wt and siEGFP cells , whereas the expressions of CK8 , HNF3b , sdc4 , and tmpress2 remained unchanged Figure 7d . The decreased protein expressions of AFP and Dab2 were further confirmed by immunofluores-cence analysis Figure 7e . Taken together , these data MEF2c ? MHC MLC-2v M28s Nkx2.5 indicate that downregulation of IP3R3 appears to affect mesodermal and some of the endodermal differentiation , but not ectodermal differentiation . Relationship between the increased apoptosis and the differentiation defect in IP3R3 knockdown cells . As shown above , the increased apoptosis is accompanied by defected mesodermal and endodermal differentiation with the IP3R3 knockdown . Next , we examined whether the IP3R3-knockdown-caused differentiation defect is due to the increased apoptosis . As the size of EBs could affect ES cell differentiation , 34 we therefore increased the initial cell numbers from 600 to 800 cells 20 ml in hanging drop stage to match the size of siIP3R3a EBs with that of the control ones Figure 8a . However , siIP3R3a EBs at an initial density of 800 cells 20 ml still had a lower percentage of cardiomyocyte differentiation compared with the control siEGFP cells at an initial density of 600 cells 20 ml Figure 8b , suggesting that the increased apoptosis observed in IP3R3 cells may not occur evenly in all differentiating cells but rather in certain cell lineages , such as progenitors of mesoderm-derived cells . To analyze this possibility , we doubly stained early mesodermal marker Flk-1 and early apoptotic marker Annexin V and analyzed by flow cytometry in differentiating cells on day 3 . Approximately 7.8 % Flk-1 ? cells were detected in control cells , whereas only 2.3 % Flk-1 ? cells were detected in siIP3R3a cells Figure 8c , a consistent result with the suppressed Flk-1 expression observed in Figure 6c . Meanwhile , in the Flk-1 ? control cells , a majority 69 % of the cells were Annexin V , whereas in Flk-1 ? siIP3R3 cells , 100 EBs 80 + Flk1 100 over 50 % of the cells were Annexin V ? Figure 8d . The data suggest that more Flk-1 ? cells tend to undergo apoptosis after downregulation of IP3R3 . As IP3R3 downregulation-enhanced apoptosis is prevented by the Ca2 ? chelator BAPTA-AM , we further analyzed whether it could rescue the expression of mesodermal and mesendodermal markers in siIP3R3 cells . As shown in Figure 8e , after the addition of BAPTA-AM , the expression of mesodermal and mesendodermal markers was rescued in siIP3R3 cells but suppressed in control cells , whereas the expression of ectodermal and endodermal markers examined remained unchanged in both cell types . These data were consistent with the observation of BAPTA-AM-dependent alteration of apoptosis Figures 5c and d , and suggest that IP3R3 downregulation-increased apoptosis at least partially con-tributes to the subsequent suppression of mesodermal and mesendodermal differentiation . Discussion The release of intracellular Ca2 ? through either IP3Rs or ryanodine receptors RyRs activates a wide variety of signaling pathways in virtually every type of cell.8,9 Generally , IP3Rs are main intracellular Ca2 ? channels in non-excitable cells , while RyRs contribute to internal Ca2 ? release in excitable cells , such as cardiac and neuronal cells.35 Consistently , as non-excitable cells , undifferentiated ES cells express three subtypes of IP3Rs Figure 1c but not RyRs.23,36 However , little is known regarding the specific function of each IP3R subtype in the self-renewal and differentiation of ES cells . Here , we revealed the novel roles of IP3R3 in the regulation of apoptosis of differentiating mES cells and cell lineage commitment . We also showed a relatively higher expression of IP3R3 in undifferentiated ES cells , but IP3R3 knockdown does not affect the characteristics of these cells . Although IP3Rs-mediated Ca2 ? oscillations are involved in cell cycle progression through G1 S phases in mES cells based on the pharmacological interference , 24 alterations of Ca2 ? oscillations by IP3R3 knockdown are only observed in differentiating but not undifferentiated ES cells . This observa-tion is consistent with the unchanged apoptosis and self-renewal properties of these cells . These results indicate that the contributory roles of IP3R3 in mediating Ca2 ? oscillations differ between undifferentiated and differentiating ES cells . The exact mechanism responsible for this discrepancy needs to be clarified in future . One important finding of this study is the negative regulation of apoptosis by IP3R3 during the early differentiation stage of ES cells . This effect seems to be associated with the alternation of Ca2 ? signals as the increased apoptosis is accompanied by elevated Ca2 ? signals in differentiating cells with IP3R3 knockdown . In addition , chelating cytosolic Ca2 ? signals by BAPTA-AM decreases the cleavage of caspase-3 and apoptosis in siIP3R3 cells Figure 5 . These findings are consistent with the previous observation that elevated cytosolic Ca2 ? signaling could lead to apoptotic responses by triggering an elevated mitochondrial matrix Ca2 ? concen-tration , and thereby enable the release of apoptotic signaling molecules , such as cytochrome c , 25 and activate the caspases.25,37 Indeed , we also found that the increased apoptosis by IP3R3 knockdown is accompanied by increases in Bax expression , caspase-3 activity , and the release of cytochrome c , suggesting that a mitochondrial apoptosis pathway might be involved in this process . Additional experiments need to be performed to determine this possibi-lity . However , how can IP3R3 function as an anti-Ca2 ? oscillatory factor in differentiating ES cells ? A similar observation was obtained previously in Hela , COS-7 , and CHO cells.15,38 One of the interpretations is that IP3R3 might have a negative feedback on the activation of other IP3R subtypes because of its property of lacking the feedback inhibition by high [ Ca2 ? ] i , 38,39 while IP3R1 and IP3R2 are regulated by cytosolic Ca2 ? in a biphasic manner 40 however , a discrepancy remains.41 In other words , the continuously releasing Ca2 ? from IP3R3 assures high [ Ca2 ? ] i in an area surrounding other IP3R subtypes and keeps them in an inactivated state , thereby terminating the cytosolic high [ Ca2 ? ] i . The precise roles of other IP3R subtypes in the regulation of [ Ca2 ? ] i and apoptosis , and the functional interaction among the IP3Rs in differentiating ES cells need to be determined . IP3R3 might also have an anti-Ca2 ? oscillatory role through a negative feedback on plasma-membrane channels , such as the canonical transient receptor potential channel that is bound and regulated by IP3R3.42 In any case , it appears that IP3R3 functions as an important regulator of other Ca2 ? channels to maintain proper cytosolic Ca2 ? signals . In addition , the Ca2 ? oscillation patterns in differentiating control cells differ from those in siIP3R3 cells Figure 5b . The observation of increased apoptosis in control cells after chelating Ca2 ? by BAPTA suggests that the Ca2 ? signals in control cells may be responsible for apoptosis protection . In agreement with our results , the similar pattern of Ca2 ? signals observed in the control cells has been shown to confer apoptosis resistance.17 As differential Ca2 ? signals , including the signal initiation , the amplitude and frequency of Ca2 ? signals , as well as the duration of the Ca2 ? elevation , may lead to different biological effects , 43 the different Ca2 ? signals chelated by BAPTA in control and IP3R3-knockdown cells may have opposite roles in the regulation of apoptosis . More detailed studies are needed to clarify these possibilities . IP3R3 appears to participate actively in apoptosis in a diversity of cell types , but its role in apoptosis is rather controversial . It has been shown that IP3R3 preferentially mediates apoptosis in some lymphocytes and CHO cells , 13,15,44 whereas it increases cellular apoptotic resistance in the presence of anti-apoptotic factor Bcl-XL in DT40 cells.16,17 Therefore , the functional regulation of IP3R3 in apoptosis may be dependent on the different modulators of IP3Rs in the individual cells . It is noteworthy that the expression profile of Bcl-XL is extremely similar to that of IP3R3 Supplementary Figure 5 . It would be anticipated , therefore , that the relatively higher expression levels of Bcl-XL and IP3R3 in undifferentiated ES cells have an anti-apoptotic effect , while the lower expression levels of Bcl-XL and IP3R3 sensitize mES cells to apoptotic insults during the early differentiation stage . Future studies are needed to elucidate the regulation of Bcl-XL on IP3R3 in differentiating ES cells . Consistent with the previous reports , 5,14 the apoptosis on differentiation day 3 increases compared with that of undifferentiated ES cells . The increased apoptosis observed in IP3R3 knockdown differentiating cells is accompanied by the lower expression of early mesodermal and mesendo-dermal markers but not early endodermal and ectodermal markers . Such lineage defection may be due to the increased apoptosis caused by IP3R3 knockdown or due to a direct role of IP3R3 on the differentiation other than apoptosis , or both . We found that the BAPTA-enhanced apoptosis in control cells is accompanied by the downregulation of expressions of mesodermal and mesendodermal markers . Consistently , the suppression of apoptosis by BAPTA in siIP3R3 cells is accompanied by the rescue of these markers Figure 8e . These results suggest a correlation between the apoptosis and mesodermal and mesendodermal differentiation . This hypothesis is supported by the observation that the proportion of early apoptotic cells Annexin V ? increases in Flk-1 ? the early mesodermal marker27 cells after IP3R3 knockdown . Taken together , these data suggest that the lower expression of early mesodermal markers and defected differentiation of mesodermal derivatives are at least partially because of the increased apoptosis in siIP3R3 cells . In addition , the siIP3R3 ES cells have defects in differentiation of some of the endodermal derivatives , in spite of the expression of analyzed early markers of the endoderm remaining unchanged . This might be due to the loss of some mesendodermal progenitors , such as Gsc ? cells , because these cells could further differentiate into definitive endodermal derivatives.45 Another probability is that IP3R3 may have a direct effect on the later differentiation of endodermal derivatives . These possibilities need to be analyzed further . Interestingly , the roles of IP3R3 in the regulation of apoptosis and differentiation are not observed in the ectodermal differentiation . Moreover , the expression of ectodermal and endodermal markers at the early differentiation stage is not affected by BAPTA-AM at a concentration affecting the expression of mesodermal and mesendodermal markers in both control and siIP3R3 cells Figure 8e . Thus , the apoptosis regulated by IP3R3 through the alteration of Ca2 ? signals may not occur in the cells expressing these markers . Taken together , these observa-tions suggest a specific function of IP3R3 in the regulation of mesodermal and mesendodermal differentiation . In conclusion , our findings for the first time show that IP3R3 negatively regulates apoptosis by the alteration of Ca2 ? oscillation patterns during early mES differentiation . Such effects at least partially contribute to the subsequent mesodermal and mesendodermal differentiation . These find-ings suggest that a proper apoptotic process during ES cell differentiation is critical for the cell lineage commitment and IP3R3 might be one of these important regulators . The precise regulation of IP3R3 and its signaling pathways related to the apoptosis and lineage-specific differentiation of ES cells remains to be elucidated . Materials and Methods EScellculture , in vitro differentiation , and transfection . Undifferentiated R1 ES cells were maintained on mitomycin C-inactivated mouse embryonic fibroblast MEF feeder layers in the presence of LIF as described earlier.46 For spontaneous differentiation of ES cells , trypsinized cells were plated on gelatin-coated culture dishes for 30 min to remove MEFs and then non-adherent cells consisting mainly of ES cells were re-placed onto gelatin-coated 35-mm culture dishes at a density of 2000 cells cm2 and cultivated in ES cell basic medium without LIF and feeder layers . Differentiation of mES cells into visceral endodermal cells , cardiomyocytes , chondrocytes , adipocytes , and neurons was initiated by a hanging drop technique as described earlier.47 Briefly , ESCs were trypsinized and cultivated as EBs using a hanging drop method in the absence of LIF for 2 days , followed by a 5-day suspension cultivation . Then EBs were plated onto gelatin-coated tissue culture dishes . Differentiated visceral endoderm cells with the characteristics of columnar morphology appeared on the periphery of EBs.48,49 Cardiomyocytes appeared in the form of spontaneously contracting cell clusters and chondrogenic differentiation was detected by Alcian blue staining . For optimal adipogenic differentiation , day 8 EBs were plated on gelatin-coated dishes and cultured with combinations of the following supplements dexamethasone 10 mm b-glycerophosphate 10 mM ascorbic acid 50 mg ml , insulin 85 nM triiodothyronine 2 nM as described earlier.50 Neuronal differentiation of ES cells was induced based on the method described earlier.51 EBs were formed in hanging drop for 2 days , followed by a 6-day suspension cultivation . All-trans retinoic acid Sigma , St. Louis , MO , USA was added during the last 4 days of suspension culture . The 8-day EBs were dissociated into a single cell and then plated onto gelatin-coated over slips in neuronal basal medium modified MEM containing 10 % F12 , 2 % B27 , 1 % N2 , and 100 mg ml bovine serum albumin for further 4�8 days cultivation . All cultivation medium and other substances or cell culture were from Invitrogen-Gibco Carlsbad , CA , USA except where indicated .

20094061	Regulation of apoptosis of immune cells is a critical stage during inflammation because when the injury is over , accom-plishment of a correct resolution , mainly through apoptotic death , prevents the development of chronic inflammatory diseases.1,2 During this process , neutrophils are quickly recruited to sites of infection at which they have a very short life and die rapidly through apoptosis.3 Macrophages arrive later to phagocytic apoptotic cells and pathogens in the affected area . Thus , for an effective resolution of the inflammatory process , it is important that macrophages have a sufficient life span to clear the inflamed area 2�3 days . Lipoxins LXs are endogenous eicosanoids that are released during the resolution phase of inflammation , in the nanomolar range.4 Lipoxins are mainly generated by trans-cellular metabolism from arachidonic acid depending on the cellular context.5,6 In mammals , lipoxygenase enzymes LOXs generate two main native products lipoxin A4 LXA4 and B4 LXB4 , with LXA4 being the most studied , which exerts potent anti-inflammatory actions modulating leukocyte traf-ficking and promoting phagocytic clearance of apoptotic cells.7,8 The effects of LXs as lipid mediators with potent anti-inflammatory actions are well documented , but their role in apoptosis remains controversial.9 For instance , an apopto-tic effect on fibroblasts after treatment with LXA4 at micro-molar concentrations has been described , 10 whereas it has been also reported that this compound inhibits peroxynitrite formation in leukocytes , 11 reduces colonocyte apoptosis12 www.nature.com cdd and promotes survival of retinal pigment epithelial cells.13 Therefore , the precise role of LXs as modulators of apoptosis remains elusive and seems to be dependent on the cell type and on the LXA4 concentration . Given the lack of studies regarding the role of LXA4 in macrophage apoptosis and considering the importance of this immune cell in inflamma-tion , we have investigated the effect of native LXA4 on macrophage apoptosis using staurosporine , etoposide and GSNO as strong apoptosis inducers in many cell types , 3,14,15 and LPS IFNg challenge as a more pathophysiological condition . Our results show that concentrations of LXA4 in the nanomolar range prevent apoptosis in murine and human macrophages through a mechanism consistent with changes in the levels of apoptosis-related proteins , favoring an antiapoptotic environment , and a blockade of early apoptotic signaling , which involves the suppression of the release of mitochondria-dependent apoptotic mediators and caspases activation . Moreover , our data show that LX treatment of macrophages promotes a rapid activation of the PI3K Akt signaling that is relevant for protection against apoptosis , in agreement with a previous study describing upregulation of antiapoptotic genes by this pathway , such as Mcl-1.16 In addition to this , treatment of macrophages with LXA4 induced ERK Nrf-2 activation , with Nrf-2 being a transcription factor that regulates the expression of ca. 100 cytoprotective genes that share in common a sequence termed antioxidant response element ARE , 17,18 and contributes to the antioxidant defense pathway in many cells.19,20 Activation of this pathway in macrophages by LXA4 decreased staurosporine-induced apoptosis , without affecting the activity of JNK and p38 MAPKs . Results LXA4 prevents stimuli-dependent apoptosis in macrophages . Preliminary studies in our laboratory suggested that LXA4 enhanced the viability of activated macrophages . Using staurosporine as a potent and broad inducer of apoptosis in mammalian cells , we evaluated the ability of LX to interfere with the apoptosis induced by this drug in macrophages . Incubation for 4 h of RAW 264.7 cells cells 30 Vehicle Apoptotic cell Apoptotic cell 100 101 102 103 104 100 101 102 103 104 Apoptotic cell Stau 100 101 102 103 104 100 101 102 103 104 FL3 Log FL3 Log with staurosporine 200 ng ml increased the percentage of annexin V-positive cells by 38 % Figure 1a . Preincubation for 2 h of the cells with LXA4 in the range of concentrations found under inflammatory conditions resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of the pro-apoptotic effect of staurosporine EC50 ? 250 nM . This protective action of LXA4 was mediated , at least in part , through its receptor , as it was interfered after 1 h of incubation with 1 mM BocPLP , a formyl peptide LXreceptor antagonist , 23,24 and was specific for LXA4 , the 15-epi-LXA4 derivative being less effective Figure 1a . Figure 1b shows a representative flow cytometry distribution of this annexin V analysis . The protective effect of LX against apoptosis was confirmed by DNA size distribution analysis , observing a significant reduction of the hypodipliod population Figure 1c . When apoptosis was induced with 104 FL3 4.7 101 FL3 39.7 50 40 % 30 0 None Stau Etop ? GSNO LPS IFN etoposide 1 mM , GSNO 0.5 mM or after LPS 500 ng ml IFNg 20 ng ml challenge , treatment of cells with LXA4 significantly decreased the apoptotic response in all these cases , suggesting the interference with a common pro-apoptotic signaling step Figure 1d . LX inhibition of caspase activation and pro-apoptotic signaling in macrophages treated with staurosporine . To study the antiapoptotic effect of LX , the activation of caspases 3 , 8 and 9 was analyzed in cells treated with staurosporine . As shown in Figure 2a , the well-known activation of caspases induced after staurosporine treatment 200 ng ml 4 h and 18 h , respectively was significantly impaired in the presence of LXA4 . In addition to these determinations , the �in vivo� activation of caspases was measured using cell-permeant fluorescent probes representative example for caspase 3 Figure 2b , left panel . Figure 2b right panel shows the percentage of cells with activated caspases 3 , 8 or 9 after staurosporine treatment . Lipoxin A4 significantly reduced the percentage of cells with activated caspases , an effect that was in the range of that observed in cells treated with the broad caspase inhibitor z-VAD 20 mM . In view of these data , the release of pro-apoptotic mediators from the mitochondria was investigated because this is one of the key events in the commitment of the apoptotic response of macrophages . As shown in Figure 3 , the release of cytochrome c panel A and apoptosis-inducing factor AIF panel B induced after staurosporine challenge was inhibited in LX-pretreated cells , and both proteins were retained in the mitochondrial particulate compartment . In addition to this , the oxidative stress induced by staurosporine in macrophages was also attenuated after LX treatment , as reflected by the decrease in DCFH oxidation in the presence of LXA4 Figure 3c . Moreover , on using DAF-2 as RNI scavenger , a dose-dependent decrease in the oxidation of this probe , promoted by staurosporine , was observed in cells pretreated with LX Figure 3d . To investigate the mechanisms mediating the antiapoptotic effects of LXA4 in macrophages , the levels of apoptosis-related proteins were determined by western blotting . As shown in Figure 4a , treatment with LXA4 increased the levels of the antiapoptotic proteins , Mcl-1 , and to a lesser extent those of x-IAP and Bcl-2 , without affecting the Bax levels on staurosporine challenge . Indeed , the ratio between Mcl-1 and also x-IAP and Bcl-2 and Bax Figure 4b well-reflected the protection against apoptosis observed in LX-treated cells . % 60 cells 50 40 Positive 30 Time h 0 ? ? -actin Porin intensity 600 To gain further insight into the differential apoptotic response of staurosporine-treated and LX-pretreated cells , we used a specific mouse apoptosis microarray to compare the gene expression profile after these treatments . Figure 4c summarizes the changes in the expression of genes , transcription of which is up down by two-folds over the threshold value , among the apoptosis-related genes analyzed . Data show that stauros-porine did not significantly alter the expression of the majority of the genes analyzed Po0.01 . Moreover , using RT-PCR to confirm the array data , it was observed that , over the genes modified by staurosporine , LXA4 was able to significantly reduce the expression of some genes , such as IL-10 Figure 4d , that promote a pro-apoptotic activity in macro-phages.25 Indeed , LX did not significantly alter the expression of most of the genes involved in staurosporine-induced apoptosis , suggesting the involvement of post-transcriptional mechanisms in its mechanism of action . control 6 Cytosol Stau Partic . +Stau LXA 1200 a.u . 800 400 DAF LX-dependent survival involves AKT and ERK activation . The rise in Mcl-1 levels after LXA4 treatment suggests the activation of the PI3K Akt pathway.16 As shown in Figure 5a , LXA4 promoted a rapid Akt phosphorylation in a PI3K-dependent manner , as deduced by the inhibitory effect observed by LY294002 incubation . In addition to this and as MAPKs have been implicated in the regulation of basic cellular processes , such as apoptosis , survival , proliferation and differentiation , and our preceding data that suggest that LXA4 influences signaling steps upstream mitochondrial pro-apoptotic targeting , the effects of LX on the activity of these kinases were investigated . As illustrated in Figure 5b and c , staurosporine induced the phosphorylation of p38 and JNK from 30 to 120 min however , this treatment did not activate ERK over its low basal level . Pretreatment with LX A4 did not affect p38 or JNK phosphorylation , but promoted a rapid activation of ERK after staurosporine challenge . Inhibition of ratio 1.2 Bax Mcl-1 0.4 this ERK activation using PD098059 1 mM or PI3K activity using LY294002 10 mM abolished the protective effect exerted by LXA4 against apoptosis Figure 5d . In addition to this , the translocation to the nucleus and activation of the transcription factor Nrf-2 was also observed in LXA4-pretreated cells following kinetics similar to that of ERK activation Figure 5e . Interestingly , unlike staurosporine , LXA4 was able to activate an ARE�luciferase reporter gene on transfection , whereas ERK inhibitor , PD098059 , impaired this response , suggesting that the cytoprotective pathway dependent on Nrf-2 activity17,18 is activated in response to LXA4 . MG132 was used as a positive control of ARE activation Figure 5f . Finally , on using peritoneal macrophages from Nrf-2-deficient mice Figure 5g , a 0 significant decrease was observed in the antiapoptotic activity mediated by LXA4 . Taken together , these data suggest a link between Akt and ERK Nrf-2 activation and the protective effects against apoptosis exerted by LXA4 in macrophages . Protection from apoptosis by LXA4 of murine and human macrophages . To validate the results obtained in RAW 264.7 cells in other sources of macrophages , we carried out some key experiments in murine peritoneal macrophages . As shown in Figure 6a , the treatment with LX promoted a rapid Akt phosphorylation in these cells that was inhibited in the presence of LY294002 . Following the same line , challenge with staurosporine produced a rise in the phospho-ERK levels in cells treated with LX , a receptor-mediated effect , as it disappeared when these macrophages were pretreated with BocPLP before LXA4 challenge Figure 6b . As in RAW 264.7 cells , apoptosis was significantly prevented in LXA4-pretreated cells after stimulation with staurosporine , LPS IFNg or the anti-mouse FAS Jo2 . In agreement with our previous data , inhibition of the ERK or PI3K pathway attenuated the antiapoptotic effect exerted by LX Figure 6c . To extend our results , we corroborated that similar effects in terms of apoptosis protection against staurosporine were obtained in cultured human monocyte macrophages and in the monocytic cell line THP-1 . These effects were also mediated by the Akt and ERK pathways as demonstrated using the corresponding inhibitors Figure 6d . Lipoxin A4 also promoted the trans-location of Nrf-2 to the nucleus in these cells as shown in Figure 6e , thereby being capable to maintain the antiapoptotic effects previously reported in murine macrophages . This study provides evidence for a new mechanism of action of LXA4 by which this compound contributes to inflammation resolution , delaying the apoptosis in murine and human Discussion macrophages . Prolonged macrophage survival is required for phagocytosis of death cells in the inflamed area , avoiding excessive accumulation of cellular debris into the injured tissues . Lipoxins are natural compounds detected in several tissues in the nanomolar range , but exhibiting a certain cell specificity . In this regard , LXs have been involved in the pathogenic mechanism of some microbes . For example , in addition to the antiapoptotic effects of LXA4 , it has been described that this LX prevents PGE2 synthesis and this strategy is used by virulent Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains to avoid repair of the macrophage plasma membrane and to promote necrosis at the time the pathogen evades macrophage function.8 Therefore , although their role as anti-inflammatory compounds is well documented , their implica-tion in apoptosis has been a matter of debate.1,3,5,26 Opposite actions of LXs on the balance between survival and apoptosis have been reported in neutrophils when signaling through the pleiotropic formylpeptide receptor like-1 LXA4 receptor.23 This receptor binds a series of molecules , including LXA4 , acute-phase reactant serum amyloid A SAA and the glucocorticoid-inducible protein annexin-1 . Although annexin 1 and LXs accelerate resolution apoptotic death of neutrophils through caspase 3 activation , SAA rescues the cells by 40 cells preventing mitochondrial dysfunction.27 In contrast to neu-trophils , macrophages arrive later to the inflamed area and they contribute to tissue clearance . Thus , our results indicate that as far as the synthesis of LXs in concerned they act as antiapoptotic molecules , preserving the macrophage function during resolution . We previously described that the release of NO by activated macrophages contributes transiently to expand macrophage viability by inhibiting caspase processing and activation through the formation of S-nitrosothiols in these enzymes.28 In line with this , results reported in this study stand directly on the mechanism of action of LX in the resolution of inflamma-tion . The data show that pretreatment of macrophages with LX diminishes staurosporine - , etoposide - , GSNO-and LPS IFNg-induced apoptosis . Moreover , in murine peritoneal macrophages and in human monocyte macrophages that exhibit an apoptotic response through the Fas FasL pathway , treatment with LXA4 also exhibited a protective effect . The fact that the protective effect of LXA4 against apoptosis was observed in human and murine primary cultures of macrophages and in macrophage cell lines suggests the existence of common mechanisms of response to LXs in these cells . The action of LX was independent of the time of pretreatment , from 12 h to 30 min , before staurosporine challenge data not shown . These data suggest that the mechanisms involved in protection against apoptosis are mainly regulated by short-term responses to LXs , rather than by profound changes in the expression of genes that regulate cell viability . AnnexinV 20 The apoptosis induced by staurosporine involves essen-tially the mitochondrial pathway.14,29 Activation of apoptosis-related proteins is considered a basic step in the apoptotic progression , being fundamental to those of the Bcl-2 family that includes both anti-and pro-apoptotic members and other related proteins . Using microarrays of apoptosis-related genes , it was observed that LXA4 fails to promote changes in the expression of these genes . However , in the presence of LX the protein levels of Bcl-2 , x-IAP and Mcl-1 , all antiapoptotic proteins , were maintained , indicating post-transcriptional regulation . Moreover , our data show that incubation of macrophages with LXA4 promotes a rapid activation of the PI3K Akt pathway that has a relevant role in the inhibition of apoptosis.30 Among the antiapoptotic genes regulated through this pathway , upregulation of Mcl-1 levels have been identified in various cell types , 17,18 a situation also prevailing in macrophages treated with LXA4 . Indeed , incubation with LX preserved the mitochondrial integrity as deduced by the minimal release of cytochrome c and AIF to the cytosol . Oxidative stress is another determinant that regulates the balance between viability apoptosis.31�33 We have analyzed the effect of LX on the liberation of some important reactive oxygen species ROS and reactive nitrogen intermediates RNIs , using fluorescent probes . Our results indicate that LX inhibits ROS and RNI release , reducing the oxidative stress associated with apoptosis . Consistent with this , treatment with LX at nanomolar concentrations also diminishes the caspase activation induced after staurosporine treatment . This inhibitory action was detected for all caspases analyzed , being the most potent effect on caspase 3 and to a lesser extent on both caspase 8 and 9 . Results from experiments using the pan-caspase inhibitor z-VAD confirmed the importance of LX reduction of caspase activation , leading to similar levels of apoptosis in macrophages . In addition to this , it is known that macrophage apoptosis is controlled by a complex network of signaling pathways , including MAPK pathways.32,34,35 This study provides evidence that LX might affect these pathways . Incubation of macrophages with staurosporine induces a rapid activation of JNK and p38 MAPKs , but not of ERK , a classic survival pathway.36 Interestingly , pretreatment with LX was able to promote ERK phosphorylation in the presence of staurospor-ine without affecting either JNK or p38 activities . Furthermore , MAPK pathway associates with the modulation of antioxidant response element ARE -driven gene expression through Nrf-2 activation , a transcription factor that is considered as the �guardian of redox homeostasis� . It has been reported that ERK activation is involved in the translocation of Nrf-2 to the nucleus where this transcription factor binds to the ARE motifs.20,37 Nrf-2 regulates the transcription of ca. 100 genes involved in cytoprotection and regulation of oxidative stress.17 Recently , it has been described that the LXA4-dependent apoptosis of human neutrophils involves the inhibition of myeloperoxidase-induced ERK , which results in a reduction in the expression of the antiapoptotic gene Mcl-1.38 However , our results provide a new mechanism by which LX impairs macrophage apoptosis , involving Nrf-2 activation through an ERK-dependent pathway.19,20 Although multiple studies exist regarding the regulation of innate immunity by LXs , including SOCS2-dependent ubiqui-tinylation of TRAF-2 and -6,39,40 our results demonstrate that LXA4 prolongs macrophages survival by a activation of the PI3K Akt pathway , leading to the expression of antiapoptotic proteins of the Bcl-2 family b activation of the ERK Nrf-2 pathway upon challenge with an apoptotic stimulus , such as staurosporine c preservation of mitochondrial function and integrity and enhancement of the antioxidant defense systems in cells d impairment of caspase activation caused by the absence of pro-apoptotic signaling dependent on the mitochondrial pathway or the death-receptor pathway . There-fore , these observations provide an additional antiapoptotic mechanism for LXA4 in macrophages and might contribute to the establishment of a hitherto unrecognized potential of LXs for the treatment of inflammatory diseases .

20094062	Lysosomes have long been implicated in necrotic or auto-phagic processes of eukaryotic cells . They belong to the acidic vacuolar apparatus , the main compartment for intra-cellular degradation of long-lived proteins and organelles , and contain a host of hydrolytic enzymes with pH optima between 4.5 and 6.5 for their catalysis . In 1969 , de Duve and colleagues1 postulated that the release of these enzymes from the lysosomes would jeopardize cellular integrity . Although a series of subsequent studies clearly linked lysosomal rupture to necrotic cell death , Firestone and colleagues2,3 reported that the induction of selective lyso-somal rupture by lysosomotropic detergents induced apopto-tic , rather than necrotic cell death . Further evidence showed that lysosomal perturbation is involved in apoptotic cell death induced by oxidative stress , 4,5 tumor necrosis factor alpha TNFa treatment , 6,7 lysosomotropic agents , 8,9 sphingo-sines10 or TRAIL.11 This suggests that the participation of lysosomal proteases in cellular processes goes beyond simple �garbage disposal� . The release of these enzymes into the cytosol during apoptosis is directly involved in the cleavage of proapoptotic substrates and or activation of caspases.12 www.nature.com cdd The most abundant lysosomal proteases are cathepsins B CTB and D CTD followed by cathepsin L CTL .13,14 CTL-deficient mice show a reduced rate of keratinocyte apoptosis during physiological regression of hair follicles resulting in a periodic hair loss phenotype.15,16 CTB has a role in the processing of Bid and caspase-2 and the produc-tion of reactive oxygen species6,17 and , together with other cathepsins , in the degradation of Bcl-2 , Bcl-xL , Mcl-1 , Bak and BimEL.18 All these events lead to mitochondrial membrane permeabilization and cytochrome c release . CTD seems to be implicated in apoptosis induced by staurosporine , p53 , oxidative stress and TNFa.19�21 More recently , spontaneous neutrophil cell death was shown to be dependent on CTD-mediated activation of caspase-8.22 Although these findings suggest that cathepsins may contribute to apoptosis initiation , the precise mechanisms of lysosomal membrane permeabili-zation LMP and cathepsin release and the requirement of these enzymes for apoptosis induction completion are still unclear . Mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization MOMP is considered a �point-of-no-return� of apoptosis.23 The main effectors of MOMP are the proapoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family , Bax and Bak.24 In living cells , Bax is a cytosolic and Bak a mitochondrial protein . On apoptosis induction , Bax translocates to the mitochondria , and both Bax and Bak oligomerize , insert into the outer mitochondrial membrane and cause MOMP.25,26 MOMP results in the release of cyto-chrome c from the intermembrane space of the mitochondria into the cytosol where it forms with Apaf-1 and pro-caspase-9 the so-called apoptosome.27 The apoptosome activates caspase-9 , which in turn cleaves and activates the effector caspases-3 and -7 that are ultimately responsible for the apoptotic demolition of the cell . More recently , it has been proposed that LMP might be due to the translocation of Bax to lysosomes independent of its movement to the mitochondria.11,28,29 If true , this process would represent another step before or concomitant with MOMP . The aim of this study was to investigate the requirements of Bax , Bak , the Apaf-1 caspase-9 apoptosome and caspases-3 -7 for LMP to identify whether cathepsins regulate early apoptotic events , such as MOMP , or rather serve the role of apoptosis amplifiers downstream or aside of the mitochondria . Results Lysosomal permeabilization and cathepsin release strictly depend on Bax Bak in monocytes and fibro - blasts . To investigate the role of lysosomes in apoptosis induction , we determined the degree of LMP in mouse monocytes factor-dependent monocytes , FDMs deprived of interleukin-3 IL-3 . We used the lysosomotropic probe acridine orange AO , a metachromatic fluorophore , which mainly accumulates in acidic organelles and displays , at high concentration , a red to orange fluorescence when excited by blue light . On lysosomal rupture , the dye is released into the cytosol where its fluorescence spectrum changes from red to green.10,30 Fluorescence-absorbent cell scanner FACS analysis of wild-type wt FDMs deprived of IL-3 for 24 h revealed a clear reduction of red fluorescence with a concomitant increase in green fluorescence Figure 1a . A similar decrease in red fluorescence was observed using the lysosomotropic probe LysoTracker Red DND-99 Figure 1a . Astonishingly , the IL-3 deprivation-induced loss of red fluorescence of both AO and LysoTracker Red was completely prevented in FDMs deficient for both Bax and Bak Bax Bak double knockout DKO Figures 1a and b . These data indicate that LMP in response to IL-3 deprivation is absolutely dependent on Bax , Bak or both . To define the time course of LMP , and whether LMP was differentially affected by Bax or Bak , we performed AO FACS analysis of wt , Bax , Bak and Bax Bak DKO FDMs deprived of IL-3 for 0�48 h . As shown in Figure 1b , the loss of lyso-somal membrane integrity was time dependent and effec-tively prevented in Bax Bak DKO cells , even at 48 h . Bax and Bak single-deficient cells exhibited a similar LMP kinetic as wt cells . This suggests that either Bax or Bak alone are sufficient to result in IL-3 deprivation-induced LMP . Lysosomal permeability is accompanied by the release of cathepsins into the cytosol where they may trigger cellular responses , including apoptosis . In particular , CTB and CTD were described to have a role in apoptotic signaling.19,22,31,32 We therefore monitored the appearance of cathepsins B , L and D in the cytosol of IL-3-deprived FDMs by western blotting and CTB CTL activity assay using the substrate z-Phe-Arg-7-amino-coumarin z-FR-AMC . The processed forms of both CTD and B were gradually lost from the membrane fraction which also contained lysosomes and appeared in the cytosol after 8�12 h of IL-3 deprivation Figure 1c . Although this occurred at different kinetics for the two proteases , it nicely corresponded with the kinetics of LMP Figure 1c . A similar cytosolic release was observed for CTL Supplementary Figure S1 . Concomitantly , we measured increased cytosolic CTB CTL activity even at neutral pH . This activity was specific because it was not only prevented by z-Phe-Ala-fluoro-methylketone z-FA.fmk , but also by three other CTB CTL inhibitors , CA074 , E64d and JPM-OEt , but not by the CTD inhibitor pepstatin Figure 1e . Importantly , as for LMP , the lysosomal loss and concomitant cytosolic appearance of CTB and CTD proteins Figure 1d and CTB CTL activity Figure 1e were effectively prevented in Bax Bak DKO cells . Given this surprising finding , it was important to show that LMP and cathepsin release were also Bax Bak dependent in other cell types and in response to other apoptotic stimuli . We therefore exposed wt , Bax , Bak and Bax Bax DKO FDMs as well as spontaneously transformed , early-passage mouse embryo fibroblasts 3T9 mouse embryonic fibroblasts MEFs to 20�50 mM etoposide or 1200 J m2 ultraviolet UV light for 24 and 48 h Figure 2 . We also treated the MEF cell lines with 50 ng ml FasL for 2�6 h , as these cells were previously shown to require Bax Bak for FasL-induced apoptosis.33 Quantitative Annexin-V PI and AO FACS analysis revealed a dose-and time-dependent increase in apoptosis Supplementary Figures S2a and b and decrease in the lysosomal membrane integrity in etoposide and UV-treated FDMs and MEFs , as well as in FasL-treated MEFs Figures 2a and b . Neither apoptosis nor LMP were majorly detected in Bax Bak DKO cells , even at high drug UV doses after 48 h . As shown in IL-3-deprived FDMs Figure 1 , UV - , etoposide-and FasL-treated MEFs exhibited a Bax Bak-and time-dependent decrease of CTB and CTD expression in the membrane lysosomal fraction and a concomitant appearance of both proteins in the cytosol Figures 3a and b and Supplementary Figure S3 . This correlated with increased cytosolic CTB CTL z-FRase activity that was not seen in the absence of Bax Bak and was blocked with the CTB CTL inhibitor z-FA.fmk Figure 3c . Importantly , the apoptotic cells did not seem to lose all CTB and CTD from lysosomes Figures 3a and b , indicating that LMP was most likely due to a discrete membrane perforation rather than a total rupture of the lysosomes . Thus , apoptotic monocytes and fibroblasts show a discrete LMP and the cytosolic release of active cathepsin enzymes in response to several apoptotic stimuli , but both processes consistently depend on Bax Bak . LMP is not due to a direct localization action of Bax and Bak on the lysosomes . Bax and Bak are required for increased mitochondrial membrane permeability to provoke caspase-dependent and -independent apoptotic signaling in the cytosol.24 Our data show that Bax and Bak are also required for LMP . Recent evidence suggested that Bax may localize to the lysosomes in addition to the mito-chondria.11,28,29 We therefore envisaged the possibility that Bax and Bak resided and acted on lysosomes to directly trigger LMP during apoptosis . We purified lysosomes from untreated and etopsoide-treated MEFs by a novel gradient centrifugation technique and tested the fractions for the co-presence of lysosomal acid phosphatase activity , the lyso-somal membrane protein lysosomal-associated membrane protein-1 Lamp-1 , the mitochondrial protein cytochrome c oxidase IV COX IV and Bax and Bak . As shown in Figures 4a and b , the first three fractions of the purification contained most of the Lamp-1 protein and acid phosphatase activity but no Bax protein . The majority of Bax and Bak were present in fractions expressing high amounts of mitochondrial COX IV fractions 5�8 . Here both Bax and Bak were activated in response to etoposide but not in control cells , as they could be immunoprecipitated with conformation-specific antibodies selectively detecting the active forms Figure 4b , lanes 5�7 , IP . Low amounts of Bak were found in the first three Lamp-1-positive fractions Figure 4b , lanes 1�3 , WB but this form of Bak was not immunoprecipitated with active-site antibodies from control or etoposide-treated cell extracts Figure 4b , lanes 1�3 , WB . In addition , these fractions were slightly contaminated with the mitochondria as they were positive for COX IV Figure 4b . Finally , immuno-fluorescence analysis of the Bak protein in control , etoposide-and UV-treated MEFs showed that Bak poorly colocalized with Lamp-1 Figure 4c . Taken together , these data show that even though Bax and Bak are required for LMP , this probably does not occur by a direct action of Bax or Bak at the lysosome . LMP occurs downstream of the apoptosome by a caspase-dependent mechanism . The finding that the Bax Bak dependence of LMP was not because of the lysosomal localization action of the two proapoptotic proteins raised the possibility that LMP occurred as a result of apoptosome formation and caspase activation . To deter-mine this , we measured apoptosis and LMP in Apaf-1 FDMs deprived of IL-3 or treated with various doses of etoposide or UV for 24 h . In addition , we treated Apaf-1 and caspase-9 MEFs with etoposide and UV . In all cases , LMP Figures 5a and b and apoptosis Supple-mentary Figures S4a and b were strongly delayed in caspase-9 and Apaf-1 cells . Next , we investigated the effector caspase requirement for apoptosis and LMP by exposing MEFs deficient in caspases-3 and -7 caspase-3 -7 DKO to 50 and 100 mM etoposide or 600�1200 J m2 UV for 24�48 h . As shown in Supplementary Figure S4c , apoptosis was majorly caspase dependent for both stimuli because caspase-3 -7 DKO MEFs displayed a slower apoptosis kinetic than wt cells . With regard to LMP this caspase requirement depended on the stimulus and the duration of the apoptotic stress . While in etoposide-treated caspase-3 -7 DKO cells , lysosomal membrane integrity was largely maintained for up to 48 h Figure 5c , this was only the case for the first 24 h of UV exposure . These data show that LMP requires the assembly of the apoptosome and , dependent on the apoptotic stimulus and time of exposure , the activation of effector caspase-3 -7 . CTB and CTL knockout cells are partially resistant to apoptosis induced by etoposide and IL-3 deprivation , but can not be rescued from cell death . We reasoned that if LMP was important for the initiation of apoptosis , deletion of cathepsins should result in protection against apoptotic stimuli . Alternatively , if LMP was largely a phenomenon resulting from the activation of apoptosis , cathepsin deficiencies would not permit cells to survive apoptotic stimuli in the long-term . To test these predictions , we generated IL-3-dependent FDMs from CTB , CTL and CTD knockout mice as previously described , 34 and tested the cells for their sensitivity to apoptosis induced by IL-3 deprivation , etoposide or UV treatment . All the knockout cells exhibited similar kinetics of LMP in response to apoptotic stimuli , indicating that the lysosomal membrane integrity was not controlled by particular cathepsins data not shown . However , CTB and CTL FDMs showed a strong delay of apoptosis induction in response to etoposide Figures 6a and b or IL-3 deprivation Figures 6a and c as compared with wt cells . No major difference in apoptosis sensitivity between wt and knockout cells was noted in CTD FDMs Figure 6 or when the cells were exposed to UV Figures 6a and d , indicating that the lysosomal contribution to apoptosis is restricted to certain cathepsin isoforms and apoptotic stimuli . Detailed kinetic analysis revealed that the slower apoptosis rate of CTB and CTL FDMs nicely correlated with delayed caspase-3 activation . Although in wt or CTD FDMs maximal caspase-3 activity peaked at 24h after IL-3 deprivation or etoposide treatment and declined thereafter , CTB and CTL FDMs exhibited maximal caspase-3 activity only after 36�48h Figures 6b and c . We also isolated MEFs from mice deficient of CTB , CTL or both CTB L DKO and exposed them to etoposide and UV . As shown in Figure 6e , CTB and B L DKO MEFs exhibited a delay in etoposide-induced Annexin-V PI staining and caspase-3 activation . This was also the case when we inhibited CTB with the cysteine protease inhibitor , E64d , in etoposide-treated wt MEFs , indicating that the apoptosis-enhancing effect of CTB was due to its proteolytic activity rather than another yet undescribed function of the enzyme . In contrast , CTL MEFs died with similar time kinetics as wt cells , as did all the cathepsin knockout cell lines exposed to UV data not shown . These data show that , as previously reported , cathepsins can influence apoptosis sensitivity but this depends on the cell type , the apoptotic stimulus and the kind of cathepsin . We have previously shown that a delay in the appearance of the morphological characteristics of apoptosis does not necessarily mean that cells have not committed to apop-tosis.34 To determine whether CTB or CTL were crucial for cell commitment to apoptosis , we performed clonogenicity assays . In this assay , monocytes were tested for their potential to form colonies in soft agar after they had been exposed to etoposide or deprived of IL-3 , but then allowed to recover in fresh medium with survival factors IL-3 . As shown in Figure 7 , Bax Bak DKO FDMs were fully rescued from apoptosis induced by IL-3 deprivation or etoposide treatment . By contrast , none of the cathepsin knockout cells could form colonies after IL-3 re-addition Figure 7a or removing etoposide Figure 7b . This was also true for cells deficient in both cathepsins B and L and for wt FDMs treated with E64d , indicating that even the lack or blockage of two cathepsins did not fully prevent apoptosis Figures 7a and b . This finding clearly shows that cathepsins B and L do not contribute to the commitment step of apoptosis as Bax and Bak do , but enhance the efficiency of apoptosis through an amplification loop . Discussion Our findings resolve a crucial aspect of apoptosis regulation that has been highly debated in the past namely , at what step of the signaling cascade LMP and the cytosolic release of cathepsins contribute to the death fate of mammalian cells . These processes have been thought to occur at early time points of apoptosis , leading to the cleavage of Bid , 17,18,35,36 the activation of caspase-217 or -8,22 or the translocation of Bax , 21 all events triggering the Bax Bak-mediated perforation of the mitochondrial outer membrane MOMP , a crucial commitment step for apoptosis induction . However , in this study , we show , using four different apoptotic stimuli UV , etoposide , FasL , IL-3 deprivation on two different cell lines MEFs and FDMs , that LMP and cathepsin release are late events of apoptosis signaling occurring downstream of MOMP in a manner depen-dent on Bax Bak , the apoptosome and effector caspases-3 and -7 . Indeed , in all cases tested , the kinetics of apoptosis Supplementary Figures S2 and S4 were slightly faster than those of LMP Figures 2 and 5 , indicating that LMP is more likely to occur after than before apoptosis induction . Why has this interdependence between LMP and MOMP been dismissed ? First , numerous studies used lysosomo-tropic agents such as LeuLeuOMe12 to force cathepsins release into the cytosol . Such experiments placed the action of cathepsins automatically upstream of MOMP , but failed to show where exactly these proteases act in response to apoptotic stimuli . Second , apoptosis induced by TNFa , H2O2 or other stimuli was considered to be �inhibited� by gene-tically deleting or pharmacologically inhibiting CTB , CTL or CTD.6,11,19�21,31 However , in the absence of clonogenic assays , it is impossible to discriminate whether such an �inhibition� is only a delay or a real blockage of cell death . Third , although LMP and cathepsin release was some-times shown to precede Bax Bak-mediated cytochrome c release , 21,22,37 the causal relationship between these two events has not yet been tested by genetically deleting apoptosis signaling components between LMP and MOMP . All three aspects were addressed in our study . We found that cathepsins were released downstream , rather than upstream of MOMP , and the lack of clonogenic survival of cathepsin KO or even DKO cells indicated that these proteases did not have an impact on the point of life-or-death decisions . The simplest explanation for the dependence of LMP on Bax Bak would be that these two proapoptotic proteins directly perforate the lysosomal membrane , in a manner analogous to the function of Bax and Bak at the mitochondrial membrane . Some experimental evidence does support such a model.11,28 However , in this study we could not convincingly immunolocalize Bak on lysosomes in response to etoposide or UV , and acid phosphatase-positive lysosomal fractions were entirely negative for inactive or active Bax . Although some Bak contaminated these fractions , it was not in an active conformation . We therefore contend that LMP does not result from a direct perforation of lysosomes by Bax and Bak . Rather , our data point toward the role of the apoptosome and caspase-3 -7 in triggering LMP . The discrepancy between previous reports and our study may be explained by the possibility that Bax does not translocate to the lysosomes from the cytosol but ends up in this compartment after autophagic sequestration of damaged mitochondria during apoptosis . Similarly , the BH3-only protein Bim could first activate Bax Bak on the mitochondria and then move to the lysosomes for degradation.11 This would be in agreement with the slight contamination of lysosomal fractions with mitochondrial proteins . Preliminary immunoelectron microscopy data suggest that Bax localizes to lysosomes exclusively in multivesicular structures reminiscent of autophagosomes data not shown . In addition , treatment with the auto-phagy inhibitor 3-MA diminished the association of Bax with these structures , indicating that Bax arrived at the lyso-somes by autophagy and not by direct translocation from the cytosol . What might be the signaling pathway linking the apopto-some and or activated effector caspases-3 -7 to LMP ? Gyrd-Hansen et al.38 implicated caspase-9 , but not Apaf-1 , in TNFa-induced LMP , suggesting that caspase-9 had an Apaf-1� , and hence apoptosomal mitochondrial independent function to cause LMP . We however propose an apoptosome-and effector caspases-3 -7-dependent mechanism , which may result in the cleavage of particular substrates mediating LMP . Candidate substrates could include regulators of oxidative stress , sphingolipid , arachidonic acid and fatty acid metabolism , components of ion channels or pumps for example , calcium , hsp70 , a protein shown to inhibit LMP , or the caspase-3 substrate NDUFS1 , the p75 subunit of mitochondrial respiratory complex I , leading to the production of reactive oxygen species.10,12,39�42 Recently , a global mapping of the topography and magnitude of proteolytic events in apoptosis has unveiled a surge of new caspase substrates , which can now be tested for their involvement in mediating LMP.43 Our study shows that CTB and CTL amplify death signaling induced by IL-3 deprivation or etoposide . Thus , these proteases still contribute to apoptosis after MOMP has occurred , although their involvement may vary in different cell types and with the death stimulus . Although immortalized MEFs treated with TNFa CHX were shown to require CTB and CTL , but not CTD for apoptosis amplification , the opposite was true when the cells were treated with staurosporine.44 Similarly , primary neutrophils mainly rely on CTD , but not CTB or CTL , for efficiently executing spontaneous apoptosis.22 We have shown that in response to UV irradiation , the mitochon-drial signaling pathway leading to caspase-3 -7 activation is sufficient for apoptosis , despite the fact that LMP and cathepsin release occur later on . In contrast , our results show that caspase-3 activation is delayed in CTB , CTL and B L DKO myeloid progenitors treated with etoposide or deprived of IL-3 . In this case , cytosolic CTB and CTL may stimulate a positive feedback loop enhancing caspase-3 processing and activity . Alternatively , these proteases may further stimulate caspase-independent processes such as necrosis.45 To resolve this issue , we need to identify cytosolic cathepsin substrates mediating alternative death signaling pathways . What role might cathepsin-mediated amplification of apop-tosis signaling have in vivo ? Under normal circumstances , apoptosis and phagocytosis of dead cells is rapid . A delay in this process , as observed in the prolonged survival of CTD-deficient neutrophils , may exaggerate innate immune responses in experimental bacterial infection and in septic shock.22 Moreover , reduced keratinocyte apoptosis in CTL-deficient mice was found to result in periodic hair loss , 15,16 and CTB-deficient animals showed diminished liver damaged on TNFa challenge.6 Our study here reveals that , in order to fully understand a particular biological process such as the role of LMP and cathepsin in apoptosis , we need robust and physiologically relevant , experimental tools and an accurate kinetic analysis of the sequence of events involved .

20139892	www.nature.com cdd Retinal degeneration RD represents a large group of clinically and genetically heterogeneous blinding diseases within which prospective gene therapies have been studied in depth.1�4 One particular form , retinitis pigmentosa RP begins with apoptotic death of the rod photoreceptors caused in many cases by mutations in genes expressed specifically by rods followed by the irreversible progressive loss of cone photoreceptors.5 The rods , which comprise up to 95 % of the cells in the outer nuclear layer ONL of human retina , provide an overwhelming contribution to retinal homeostasis and are thus likely to have a determining role in the fate of the cones . This role is critical as cones mediate vision in lit conditions as well as the visual perception of color and fine-detail and their loss unleashes the most debilitating aspects of blindness.6,7 A point of therapeutic intervention after rod demise aimed at preserving cone survival may be sufficient for patient benefit and perhaps optimal , given the range of somatic gene therapies that would otherwise be required . With this objective in mind , the rod-derived cone viability factor RdCVF was identified in 2004.8 The factor isolated by high content screening protects cones in two rodent models of RD , the rd1 mouse8 and the Pro23His rat9 and in vitro mediates the resistance to photooxidative damage.10 RdCVF corresponds to a truncated thioredoxin TRX -like protein and is encoded by the exon 1 of the nucleoredoxin-like 1 Nxnl1 gene . In addition to the RdCVF mRNA , the Nxnl1 gene produces a second mRNA by splicing together exons 1 and 2 to yield a longer protein isoform RdCVFL containing an entire TRX fold . We have also identified Nxnl2 , a paralogue encoding the RdCVF2 protein.11 TRX proteins have an important role in maintaining a reducing environment in the cell.12 The diverse integrated TRX functions , which include apoptosis and cell communication , are based on thiol-oxidoreductase reactions mediated by a conserved CXXC catalytic site within the TRX fold . Disruption of TRXs can thus lead to conditions of oxidative stress . RdCVF does not have any thiol-oxidoreductase activity , however , the production of a second Nxnl1 gene product RdCVFL , corresponding to an active TRX in the �living fossil� , Carcinoscorpius , suggests that the trophic activity is regulated by redox signaling through the mediation of RdCVFL.13 Recently , we have shown the participation of RdCVFL in the oxidative stress signaling through its interaction with the microtubule-binding protein TAU.14 We show here that the disruption of the Nxnl1 gene leads to a progressive loss of the function and viability of both cone and rod photoreceptors . Furthermore , the sensitivity of the Nxnl1 knockout mice to oxidative stress shows that RdCVF is part of an endogenous redox-based signaling pathway involved in the maintenance of the retina . These observations are made in the Nxnl1 mouse , which nevertheless express the potentially compensatory Nxnl2 gene , showing a critical and unique protective role for this gene in the retina . Results Construction of Nxnl1 gene targeting was used recombination an embryonic stem ES cell line with an allele where loxP sites frame exon 1 of the Nxnl1 gene Figure 1a . ES cells carrying the targeted allele Figure 1b were injected into blastocysts and subsequently injected into foster mothers to generate chimeric mice on the non-pigmented BALB c background . Male chimeric mice were crossed with females of a BALB c Cre-deletor strain . Heterozygote Nxnl1 ? mice were shown to transmit the recombinated allele Figure 1c . From sib-mating the control wild type and the homozygous knockout mice were produced . The absence of expression of RdCVFL , the second product of the Nxnl1 gene , was verified by western blot on retinal extracts Reduction in Cone Cell Density and Outer Nuclear Thickness in the Nxnl1 mouse . The cone cell density in the mice was measured by labeling cones in flat-mounted retinas with the lectin peanut agglutinin PNA , Figure 2a . A decrease of 17 % in the overall number of cones in the Nxnl1 mouse was determined , Nxnl1 ? ? 6766 ? 153 Nxnl1 5654 ? 256 , P ? 0.008 Figure 2b for mice at 15 weeks of age n ? 12 . A corresponding reduction was determined in counts when opsin-specific antibodies were used . M-opsin Nxnl1 ? ? 1721 ? 310 Nxnl1 1305 ? 125 , Pp0.05 , Figure 2c , S-opsin Nxnl1 ? ? 1971 ? 470 Nxnl1 1204 ? 200 , P ? 0.06 Figure 2d . As the rod photoreceptors comprise more than 95 % of the ONL , the overall thickness of this layer reveals both rod number and integrity . The ONL was found reduced by 20 % in central parts of the superior retina , Po0.05 Figure 2e . This reduction progresses with the age of the animal between 3 and 6 months Figure 2f and may be caused by a reduction in cell number and or their alignment in the ONL . Paradoxically , no TUNEL-positive cells are detected in the 12-month Figure 2g or the 3-month-old Nxnl1 retina compared with positive controls using rd1 retina Supplementary Figure S2 . However , we found that the Nxnl1 retinas contain aggregated TAU protein as measured by filter-binding assay Figure 2h , as found in the brain of patients suffering from Alzheimer�s disease , and in agreement to the interaction of RdCVFL with TAU.14 We also observe by electron microscopy that the soma of rod photoreceptor cell bodies is considerably darker in wild type than in the Nxnl1 retinas at 12 months of age possibly indicating a vacuolated cytoplasm in the photoreceptors Figures 2j and m . More-over , significant disruption of outer segments of rods is already evident at 3 months of age Figures 2i and l , with an increase of the extracellular space between the segmented stacks . At advanced ages , increased extracellular spaces can also be observed in retinas from 18-month-old Nxnl1 mice where nuclear stain DAPI and the ONL marker recoverin are used Figures 2k and n . The extracellular spaces may represent cell loss and result in the thinning of the ONL as a function of age . Impaired Vision of the Nxnl1 Mouse . The light - adapted electroretinogram ERG wave amplitude , reflecting cone function was recorded after 10 min of light saturation in response to flashes of light intensity of 10cds m2 . We did not observe any significant differences at 3 months of age between the two genotypes using photopic and flicker ERG a cone photoreceptor-mediated response examined after 10 min of 25 cds m2 light bleach , Figure 3a . A 24 % reduction in amplitude was recorded at 7 months that was further reduced to 32 % at 12 months , Pp0.05 Figure 3b . Thus , in accordance with a functional deficit that progresses with age , the cone b-wave amplitudes of both the Nxnl1 ? ? and Nxnl1 decrease as the mice age , but the reduction is more pronounced for the Nxnl1 mice and precedes the loss of cone cells . The rod-mediated responses were recorded at a range of light intensities 0.001�10 cds m2 after 12-h dark-adaptation . A steady decline in the Nxnl1 a-and b-wave amplitudes in all three age groups 3 , 7 and 12 months are observed with increasing light intensity as shown at 3 months Figure 3c . The differences in the response were maximal for the mixed rod cone response at a flash intensity of 1 cds m2 . When plotted as a function of age , the a-wave amplitude shows a 26 % reduction at 3 months to 57 % reduction at 12 months , P ? 0.007 Figure 3d . The b-wave amplitudes are proportion-ally reduced such that the b a ratios are equivalent for the two genotypes , suggesting that the defect is not located within the inner retinal layer . The maximum voltage responses for the b wave Vmax are listed in Table 1 . As expected , the scotopic trend recorded for the Nxnl1 ? ? mice shows increasing voltage response from 0.001 to 10 cds m2 . This is because time intervals between each scotopic recording are length-ened in proportion with increasing flash intensity allowing the rods to dark-adapt and thus recover function between each flash . In contrast , and as observed at 12 months of age , the b-wave amplitude for the Nxnl1 mice reaches maximal scotopic response at 0.01 cds m2 and decreases at higher intensities Figure 3e . To analyze this more precisely , we recorded scotopic responses after increasing time intervals of recovery from 5 min of photo-bleach of 3 cds m2 . In all , 5 to 15 min of dark-adaptation is required for the Nxnl1 mouse to recover function and respond to a flash stimulus of 0.1 cds m2 , while the Nxnl1 ? ? mouse has recovered within 2 min Figure 3f . Although the parameter k that corresponds to the inverse of the sensitivity of the visual response value did not change significantly across the age groups for the Nxnl1 ? ? mice , it did increase significantly in the Nxnl1 mice between 3 and 12 months of age from 0.097 to 0.691 cds m2 showing an age-related decline in the sensitivity of the rods in the absence of Nxnl1 Tables 1 and 2 . Differential Gene Expression in the Nxnl1 Retina Reveals Early Abnormalities . Microarray profiling of Nxnl1 retina at postnatal day 40 PN40 was performed to identify molecular events that precede the phenotypic changes . Candidate gene expression changes were validated by quantitative RT-PCR Supplementary Table S1 . The largest fold change , aside from the Nxnl1 gene itself named here Txnl6 , is for Endothelin 2 , Edn2 with a 35-fold induction in the Nxnl1 retina Supplementary Table S2 . Edn2 expression is highly induced in all tested models of photoreceptor disease or injury and points to early abnormalities of the Nxnl1 retina.15 Stress-activated genes are also induced , such as the crystallins , Gckr linked to metabolic stress and retinol dehydrogenase 9 reflecting possible oxidative stress . We also identified the downregulation of genes of the visual cycle , such as Recoverin Rcvrn and Irbp3 , in coherence with the delay in dark-adaptation Figure 3f . In addition , we observed a perturbed expression of genes encoding for cytoskeleton and ciliary proteins . Injury Response , Microglial-activation and FGF2-Signaling in the Nxnl1 Retina . Nudix is among the transcripts most significantly induced in the Nxnl1 retina Supplementary Table S2 . This natural antisense of the Fgf2 gene is induced in many pathological conditions.16 In the retina of the Nxnl1 mice at 3 months of age , the 22 and 22.5-kDa isoforms of FGF2 are more abundant in the total cell extract and the 18-kDa isoform of FGF2 is present at higher levels both in the total extract and in the nuclear fraction Figure 4a . By 12 months , the level of FGF2 is reduced Figure 4b . The microglia marker protein IBA-1 is also increased implicating the activation of microglial cells as the source of FGF2 Figures 4c�d . At 3 months of age , an eightfold increase in microglial cell number in Nxnl1 mice was quantified n ? 4 , Figure 4c and was maintained at 12 months of age Figure 4d . By immunocolocalization , we show that the higher retinal spread of microglial cells is spatially correlated with an increase in FGF2 levels in the Age + + + + Age + + Lipid peroxidation in Older Nxnl1 Retina and Cone Sensitivity to Hyperoxia . In older mice , at 18 months , an accumulating effect of the response to stress is evidenced by the increase expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein GFAP , Figures 5a�b . A generalized injury response is thus maintained throughout life in the Nxnl1 mice . Among the most toxic products formed because of lipid peroxidation , acrolein and 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal 4-HNE can modify proteins and inactivate enzymes21 and are used as biomarkers of oxidative damage in AMD.22 The immunostain-ing pattern for these adducts was examined in mice at 3 months of age Supplementary Figure S3 and at 18 months Figures 5c�d . 4-HNE antibody did not label the Nxnl1 ? ? retina but stains the inner retina and photoreceptor cell bodies of the ONL of the Nxnl1 mouse retina with increased intensity at 18 months . We also estimated the level of lipid peroxidation using malondialdehyde MDA . A 55 % increase in the level of MDA concentration was measured in the Nxnl1 retina compared with Nxnl1 ? ? at 6 months of age Figure 5e , but not at 3 months not shown . Further - retina Figures 4e�f . Such a response is similarly recorded in a number of pathological conditions , including age-related macular degeneration AMD .17�19 This is indicative of an endogenous retinal defense against stress existing in the absence of the Nxnl1 gene products arising at an early age . With increasing age this defense may be dampened , as evidenced by declining FGF2 levels Figure 4b and microglial infiltration of the ONL Figure 4d , however , levels remain increased compared with the wild type . It is worth noting that , in addition to secretion of neurotrophic factors , the retinal microglia can trigger inflammation and thus their activation represents a double-edged sword for the survival of neuronal cells.20 more , brain lysates from these mice did not show any increase in MDA concentration between the two genotypes showing the peroxidation to be specific of the tissue in which Nxnl1 is expressed.11 Acrolein immunostaining was found more pronounced in the Nxnl1 retina at 18 months of age Figures 5f�g , particularly in regions surrounding cone outer segments Figures 5h�i . Similar to 4-HNE , the acrolein staining while present in the knockout retina at 3 months Supplementary Figure S3 was more pronounced at 18 months . Oxidative Damage to Photoreceptor Proteins Leads to Cellular Dysfunction . Lipid peroxidation alongside the generalized injury response in the Nxnl1 retina may arise because of the absence of the TRX enzymatic activity carried by RdCVFL and the consequential changes in the redox environment of the retinal cells . We therefore examine visual function of the Nxnl1 mice under oxidative stress conditions , by increasing the oxygen pressure in the retina.23 Mice at 3 months of age were caged in a 75 % oxygen-enriched environment for 2 weeks , following which retinal function was analyzed . After 12 h of dark-adaptation , the cone flicker ERG amplitude was recorded and found to be markedly reduced for the Nxnl1 mice under hyperoxic compared with normoxic conditions , contrarily to controls Figures 6a�c . The amplitude is reduced by 60 % for the Nxnl1 mice in two separate experiments n ? 10 for each group . The difference in the amplitudes recorded before hyperoxia was not significant 33 mV for Nxnl1 ? ? , 23.7 mV Nxnl1 , P ? 0.2 . However , the difference becomes significant after hyperoxia 28 mV for Nxnl1 ? ? , 10.7 mV for Nxnl1 , Po0.01 . Furthermore , this deficit in cone function is reflected in a 52 % loss of M-opsin transcript and a 21 % loss of S-opsin transcripts Supplementary Table S3 . The retinas of BALB c mice have previously been found to be resistant to the detrimental effects of hyperoxic caging and this resistance is evident for the Nxnl1 ? ? mice.24 In contrast , the cone function of the Nxnl1 mice is particularly vulnerable to hyperoxia-induced damage . As under normoxic conditions , TUNEL-positive cells are not detected in the wild-type or the knockout retinas Supplementary Figure S2 and can not therefore be correlated with the functional changes . However , a decrease of over 40 % in the expression of the anti-apoptotic BCL2 protein is found , in agreement with the decrease in Bcl2 gene expression detected by microarray Supplementary Table S2 , while the level of pro-apoptotic BID is increased by over 30 % , and BAX over 100 % only in the Nxnl1 ? ? retina Figures 6d�e . It is notable that BCL2 retinal protein levels in the wild type may protect this retina from the damaging effects of hyperoxia Figures 6d�e . In contrast , in the knockout the BCL2 levels may not be sufficient to prevent this damage . We analyze here the role of the retinal-specific trophic factor RdCVF in vivo by analyzing the phenotype of a mouse engineered with a disrupted RdCVF-encoding gene , Nxnl1 . The phenotype of the Nxnl1 mouse suggests that RdCVF does not have an essential role in development with normal formation of the retinal layers Supplementary Figure S1 and instead has a role in the maintenance of the retina . A homolog of RdCVF termed RdCVF2 , encoded by the gene Nxnl211 is predicted to compensate for RdCVF in the Nxnl1 mouse retina , however , as we show here this potential compensation is not complete . Changes in the visual phenotype of the model are relatively mild until 6 months , after which the degenerative effects of age are more pronounced in Nxnl1 mouse retinas compared with Nxnl1 ? ? . The delay in visual recovery to dark-adaptation Figures 3d�f possibly indicates a dysfunction of the visual cycle . The described defect in the rods may be attributed to the absence of a paracrine activity from secreted RdCVF or alternatively to the absence of the second isoform encoded by the gene RdCVFL within the rods themselves.14 The presence of aggregates of TAU , an RdCVFL interacting protein indicates that the death of photoreceptors in the Nxnl1 retina may be triggered by these aggregates , as reported in Alzheimer�s disease.25 TUNEL-positive cells are not detected , however , this may be explained by the slower rate of degeneration observed here , with 20 % of the cells in the ONL lost over a period of 6 months as compared with the rd1 , which looses 97 % of these cells over 15 days Supplementary Figure S2 . The reduced cone number and function Figures 2a�d , 3a�b is evidence that RdCVF is involved in the viability of these photoreceptors . However , the cone phenotype under normal conditions is milder than that of the rod as such additional protective pathways are likely to be involved.26 Nevertheless , as the cone-specific detrimental effects of hyperoxia in the Nxnl1 mouse retina show , the cone-protective role of this factor appears to be magnified under conditions of stress , as arises during RD . On the basis of the presence of an entire TRX domain of RdCVFL , we hypothesized that the photoreceptor defects result from oxidative stress in the absence of RdCVFL . To analyze this , we examined the oxidative-stress responses of the Nxnl1 mouse and found that the Nxnl1 mice show decreased cone function following hyperoxia Figures 6a�c . This suggests that RdCVF has a role in protection against hyperoxia , of significance given that oxygen toxicity is considered to be a major factor in triggering cone photo-receptor death and thus the onset of severe blindness in the end stages of RP.27 However , the mechanism of cell loss itself remains ambiguous with a marked absence of TUNEL-positive cells in the retinas of the knockout mice at 3 and 12 months of age . TUNEL staining , although a classic marker for apoptosis may not be reliable in some forms of RD , as the highly efficient autophagocytic mechanisms inherent to retinal function may achieve a rapid clearance of cell debris with each wave of cell loss.28 Apart from the kinetics of rod death , the nuclear fragmentation of the dying cells may never be detectable where autophagy arises in close parallel with apoptosis , as has been described to occur in the rd1 mouse and in models of light damage.29 The ultrastructural images here support the possibility that vacuolation and the infiltration of autophago-somes is occurring in the cytoplasm of Nxnl1 ONL cells and may explain the absence of TUNEL-positive cells . Furthermore , there are other indications of activity from specific cell-death pathways in the Nxnl1 retina . Altera-tions in the Bcl2-signaling , a pathway associated with developmental cell death , are reflected in decreased levels of anti-apoptotic BCL2 protein Figures 6d�e and an imbalance in the overall BCL2 BAX BID ratio . The over-expression of TRX 1 has previously been shown to protect against hyperoxia-induced apoptosis in alveolar cells by the upregulation of BCL2 protein.30 The absence of the TRX-like RdCVFL protein in the Nxnl1 mouse may lead to a disruption of the Bcl2-signaling pathway and therefore compromise a necessary defense mechanism for the mouse retina under conditions of hyperoxia . The retinal transcriptome at PN40 reveals early abnormal-ities that precede phenotypic changes . The genes whose expression level is correlated to the number of copies of the Nxnl1 gene are likely to have a direct involvement in Nxnl1 signaling . Three major potential pathways were distinguished . The fatty acid transporter genes , Fabp4 , the trimethyllysine hydroxylase , Tmlhe and the Stearoyl-Coenzyme A desatur-ase-2 , Scd2 show a dose-dependent dowregulation Table 3 , Supplementary Table S2 and are all involved in energy metabolism . Their downregulation is suggestive of metabolic changes at the onset of RD similar to that observed before cone death in the rd1 mouse model.26 We also observed a gene dose-dependent reduction of two regulators of the Wnt pathway Btrc and Porcupine Porcn , a pathway related to that of nucleoredoxin , the distant homolog of Nxnl1.31 Finally , the Srpk2 , Cugbp2 , Son and Donson involved in alternative splicing , support the interesting possibility that RdCVF and or RdCVFL are able to regulate their own relative expression by controlling the expression of specific splicing factors . From this work , we suggest the rod defect to be specifically linked to the absence of the long isoform RdCVFL and to the resulting loss of the redox regulation of targeted proteins , such Table 3 Pathways identified as Nxnl1 dose dependent Energy metabolism as TAU . However , we also show that a cone-protective function , which in earlier studies was achieved through delivery of the short isoform RdCVF , 8,9 is absent in the Nxnl1 model under conditions of more advanced stress . Materials and Methods Animals . All procedures in this study adhered to the ARVO Statement for the use of Animals in Ophthalmic and Vision Research . Animals were housed under a 12-h light 12-h dark cycle and given ad libitum access to food and water . Nxnl1 genomic sequences corresponding to Nxnl1 50UTR , exon 1 and intron 1 were amplified from BALB c mouse genomic DNA and subcloned into a modified targeting vector containing a loxP recombination site as well as an FRT-flanked neomycin cassette . Subcloned sequences were validated by comparison with sequences available from the Mouse Ensembl database gene ID EN-SMUSG00000034829 . Finally , a loxP element was inserted into the 50UTR upstream of exon 1 , resulting in the plasmid pNxnl1 target . BALB c mouse ES cell culture was performed with primary X-ray inactivated embryonic fibroblasts derived from DR4 mice . ES cells were transfected by electroporation using 12 mg of linearized pNxnl1 target . Transfected ES cells were selected for neomycin resistance using 0.2 mg ml geneticin Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA , USA . For positive� negative selection , 10 days after transfection , G418-resistant ES cell clones were isolated and analyzed by polymerase chain reaction PCR for homologous recombination and for the presence of the loxP element integrated into the Nxnl1 50UTR . To remove the neomycin selection cassette targeted ES cells were transfected with an Flp expression plasmid . Individual ES cell clones were subsequently screened for neomycin sensitivity . DNA was prepared from selected neomycin-sensitive ES cell clones and analyzed by PCR for the loss of the selection cassette . Southern blotting was performed on 12 mg of genomic DNA , digested with 30 units of the XbaI restriction enzyme and separated on a 1 % agarose gel . After denaturation the DNA was blotted on a Hybond N ? membrane GE Healthcare , Munchen , Germany followed by UV crosslinking . Hybridization with the 32 P-labeled DNA probe Rediprime II Random prime labeling kit , GE Healthcare was performed in Perfect Plus Hybridization buffer Sigma , St. Louis , MO , USA at 65 1C overnight . After washing of the hybridized membrane , image analysis was performed using a phosphoimager . Targeted BALB c ES cells were injected into C57Bl 6 host blastocysts , which were then transferred into pseudopregnant CB6F1 foster mothers . Chimeric offspring were identified by coat pigmentation white BALB c on a black C57Bl 6 background . White offspring indicated the germline transmission of the targeted ES cells and were further analyzed for their correct genotype . To generate Nxnl1 knockout mice , targeted mice were mated with BALB c Cre deleter females C-TgN CMV-Cre # Cgn , resulting in Cre-mediated loxP recombination and the excision of the floxed exon 1 of the Nxnl1 gene.32 Offspring were analyzed for their genotype by PCR performed on genomic DNA prepared from tail biopsies primer sequences available on request . Cone counting . Cone counting was performed on mice at 15 weeks n ? 10 . The retinas were carefully dissected from surrounding tissue in phosphate-buffered saline 0.01 M , pH 7.4 PBS warmed to 37 1C and transferred to 4 % paraformaldehyde at 4 1C overnight . The retinas were prepared for staining , as described earlier.33 Retinas were labeled using either FITC -conjugated PNA lectin from arachis hypogae , PNA 1 40 , 34 a S-opsin antibody at 1 400 or a M-opsin-specific antibody 1 200 , Calbiochem , San Diego , CA , USA at 4 1C . Incubation times were 24 h for PNA and 48 h for opsin antibodies . The retinas were then rinsed in PBS , 0.05 % Tween-20 and , in the case of opsin-specific antibodies , incubated with a goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to either Alexa TM 594 or 488 at 1 500 for 2 h at room temperature . The retinas were whole-mounted photoreceptor side-up in fade-resistant mounting media Biomedia , Forster City , CA , USA . Cryosectioning and immunostaining . For cryosections , the eyes were enucleated quickly and immersed in PBS . The center of the cornea was removed to allow penetration of the fixative . The eyes were immersed at 4 1C overnight in 4 % paraformaldehyde in PBS . The tissues were incubated successively in 10 , 20 and 30 % sucrose at 4 1C for cryoprotection and embedded in O.C.T. cryoembedding media Sakura Finetek , Gentaur , Belgium . Frozen sections of 10-mm thickness were used for immunohistochemistry. Antibodies were diluted in blocking buffer 5 % BSA in PBS-Tween 0.05 % , at a concentration of 1 250 for the rhodopsin antibody Rho-4D2 , 35 1 100 for FGF2 Millipore , Billerica , MA , USA , 1 1000 respectively for recoverin Millipore , RPE65 Abcam , Cambridge , UK , GFAP Dako , Glostrup , Denmark and Glutamine synthetase Chemicon , Millipore , MA , USA . A concentration of 1 350 was used for HNE antibody Calbiochem and 1 200 for acrolein antibody Cosmo Bio , Tokyo , Japan . Primary antibodies were incubated overnight at 4 1C . For immunostaining using the acrolein antibody , slides were subjected to antigen retrieval heating�cooling cycles as described previously.36 For flat-mounted retinas , an immunostain using IBA1 at 1 300 Wako Chemicals , Inc. , Tokyo , Japan was used . For each antibody , after washing , sectioned tissues were incubated with a secondary antibody goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated to either Alexa TM 594 or 488 at 1 500 for 1 h . The nuclear marker 40-6-diamidino-2-phenylindole DAPI , Sigma , Lyon , France was added to the incubation solution for sectioned tissues , which were ultimately mounted with fade-resistant mounting media Biomedia . TUNEL assay . To detect DNA fragmentation in retinal cells , the 10-mm cryosections from mice retinas were treated with an in situ cell death detection kit Roche , Indianapolis , IN , USA using the TUNEL technique according to the manufacturer�s instructions . Filter-binding assay . Retinal extracts were made in lysis buffer 10 mM Tris HCl , pH 8.0 , 150 mM NaCl , 1 mM EDTA , 1 % NP40 , 1 % sodium deoxycholate , sonicated and suspended in PBS 2 % SDS . In all , 50 mg of protein was filtered through 0.22 mm nitrocellulose membrane using biodot microfiltration apparatus Bio-Rad , Hertfordshire , UK as described.37 The membrane was probed with the anti-TAU5 antibody Abcam , 1 500 . Semithin sectioning and ONL measurement . Mice were anesthetized by a mixture of ketamine 160 mg kg xylazine 32 mg kg followed immediately by vascular perfusion of glutharaldehyde 2.5 % and formaldehyde 2 % in PBS . The eyes were embedded in epoxy resin and histological sections of 1-mm thick were made along the sagital axis at the optic nerve level as previously described.38 Briefly , in each of the superior dorsal and inferior ventral hemispheres , ONL thickness was measured in nine sets of three measurements each total of 27 measurements in each hemisphere . Each set was centered on adjacent 250-mm lengths of the retina , with the first set centered 250 mm from the optic nerve head and subsequent sets located more peripherally . Within each 250-mm length , the three measurements were made at defined points separated from one another by 50 mm . The 54 measurements in the two hemispheres sampled are representative of the entire retina . Transmission electron microscopy . The eye cups were fixed in 2.5 % glutharaldehyde at room temperature 2 h , extensively washed overnight and post-fixed in osmium tetraoxide 1 % for 1 h at room temperature . Samples were washed in Ringer�Krebs Buffer 140 mM NaCl 4.5 mM KCl , 2.2 mM CaCl2 , 12 mM MgSO4 , 12 mM NaHCO3 , 0.44 mM KH2PO4 , 5.55 mM glucose , pH 7.4 followed by dehydration in graded ethanol and acetone . They were embedded in epoxy resin and ultrathin sections 400 to 600 nm were cut and stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate and observed under an electron microscope Met Zeiss 912 , Le Pecq , France at 80 kV . Western blotting . Retinas from mice were dissected and homogenized by sonication in RIPA buffer PBS buffer , 1 % NP-40 , 0.5 % sodium deoxycholate , 0.1 % sodium dodecyl sulfate containing protease inhibitors . Isolation of DNA-binding proteins was achieved using a high-salt extraction protocol as described by Andrews and Faller.39 Whole cell extract protein concentrations were measured by Bradford�s assay . Nuclear extract protein concentration was measured using the RC-DC protein assay Bio-Rad , San Diego , CA , USA . In all , 40 mg of protein was loaded on a 12 % SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose . The membrane was saturated with PBS 1x , 0.05 % Tween-20 , 5 % nonfat dry milk for 1 h at room temperature and then incubated overnight at 4 1C with anti-FGF2 1 1000 , Millipore , anti-BAX 1 1000 , Cell Signaling , Danvers , MA , USA , # 2772 , anti-BCL2 1 1000 , Abcam , ab18210 , Cambridge , MA , USA or anti-BID 1 800 , Millipore AB1730 . After washing , the membrane was incubated with peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody 1 15000 , Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories , Hamburg , Germany for 1 h at room temperature . Antibody binding was revealed by Enhanced Chemiluminescence system and hyperfilm-ECL X-ray film GE Healthcare , GmbH . To ensure equal loading an antibody-removal was achieved using Reblot recycling kit Chemicon , Millipore , the membrane was then washed , saturated and subsequently reincubated with monoclonal anti-b actin antibody 1 1000 , T5168 , Sigma and anti-TBP18 1 1000 , Abcam . MDA assay . To test for the level of MDA , a product of retinal lipid peroxidation a TBARS assay kit was used Cayman Chemical Company , Ann Arbor , MI , USA . In all , 25 mg of retinal tissue or brain tissue was sonicated on ice in 250 ml of RIPA buffer . Following centrifugation at 1600 g for 10 min at 4 1C , the supernatant was stored for use in the assay . The prescribed TBARS protocol was used , in addition to the duplicate pipetting of MDA aliquots of known concentration to produce a standard curve and the triplicate-pipetting of each test sample . The absorbance was read from the 96-well plate at 570 nm using a plate reader . The averaged values were used to determine MDA concentration from the MDA standard curve graph . TBARS analysis was repeated three times on retinal lysate with n ? 3 mice used in each assay . RNA purification and gene expression analysis . Animals were killed by cervical dislocation . The eyes were removed , and retinal tissue was dissected free of retinal pigment epithelium RPE and placed in guanidine HCl Promega , Charbonnieres , ` France . The samples were subsequently disrupted and homogenized using a rotor stator Polytron PT2100 . RNA used for transcriptomic studies was purified from a cesium chloride gradient produced by high-speed ultracentrifugation according to the method of Glisin et al.40 Microarray analysis . Using purified retinal RNA from PN40 mice n ? 5 , cDNA probes were subsequently generated and hybridized to Affymetrix gene chips mouse genome 430 2.0 array , Santa Clara , CA , USA . Three replicates were performed for each experiment . quality control QC was performed using RReportGenerator , 41 and confirmed that all arrays used in the study were of good and consistent quality available on request . The complete QC report is available on request . Affymetrix raw data were summarized and normalized using gcrma R Bioconductor and filtered to remove genes with very low signal intensities in all samples . Differential gene expression in the Nxnl1 ? and Nxnl1 transcriptomes was determined using local false discovery rate FDR .42 The genes resulting from the statistical analysis of ? ? , ? and mice were combined to a single non-redundant list and the standardized expression profiles for each probe-set were clustered using DPC.43 Out of the resulting clusters only the clusters with progressively decreasing cluster-averages minimum slope of 1.1 were selected and upregulated or downregulated probe-sets combined . The validity of the clustering results was verified by plotting i the cluster-profiles of the original non-standardized data and ii by projection onto the first and second principal components data not shown . lacrigel Europhta to further ensure good electrical contact . A stainless steel reference electrode to normalize signal output was inserted subcutaneously in the cheek of the mouse and a second needle electrode inserted subcutaneously in the back of the mouse served to ground the signal . Recordings were made from both eyes simultaneously.44 ERGs were performed on n ? 7 mice at each age group under normal conditions . ERGs were carried out on n ? 10 mice from two replica experiments involving hyperoxic containment of mice , the second of which carried out as a blind test . Recording measurements . The light stimulus was provided by a 150 W xenon lamp in a Ganzfeld stimulator Multiliner Vision , Jaeger Toennies , Germany . Responses were amplified and filtered 1 Hz-low and 300 Hz-high cut off filters with a 1 channel DC-AC-amplifier . Following overnight dark-adaptation rod responses were determined to flash intensities between 0.01 and 10 cds m2 . Each scotopic ERG represents the average of five responses from a set of five flashes of stimulation . For recovery experiments bleaching was carried out in the Ganzfeld dome at 3 cds m2 for 5-min periods and the scotopic responses recorded using a 0.1 cds m2 stimulus . To isolate cone responses a 10-min light saturation at 25 cds m2 was used to desensitize the rods.45 The cone photopic ERGs shown represents the average of 10 responses from 10 consecutive flashes at 10 cds m2 intensity . The flicker ERG was also used to isolate cone responses at flash frequencies of 10 , 15 and 30 Hz and 3 cds m2 intensity . Data acquisition . For all scotopic recordings , a-wave amplitude was measured from the baseline to the a-wave trough and b-wave amplitude was measured from the a-wave trough to the peak of the b wave . The murine cone ERG has no initial a wave except under the weakest background field , therefore photopic-wave amplitudes were measured from the base-line to the peak of the photopic b wave.45 The Naka�Rushton equation45,46 was used to determine the sensitivity of the rod response V ? Vmax*I n k n ? I n V refers to the voltage at intensity I , Vmax is the maximum amplitude elicited in the intensity series and the parameter k represents the light intensity required to produce a half-maximal response . The least-square curve fits of scotopic b-wave data were carried out using OriginPro version 8 software Northampton , MA , USA to calculate parameters of the Naka�Rushton function . Electroretinography Handling the mice . After overnight dark-adaptation , animals were prepared for recording under dim red light . After intramuscular anesthesia with a mixture of ketamine 80 mg kg and xylazine 16 mg kg diluted in saline , pupils were dilated by topical application of 1 % atropine sulfate . Upper and lower lids were retracted to keep the eye open and proptosed . Body temperature was maintained at 37 1C through the use of a circulating hot water heating pad . The electrical signal was recorded using a pair of electrodes constructed specifically for use on mice .

20139893	www.nature.com cdd Chronic myeloid leukemia CML is a disorder of hemato-poietic stem cells caused by the constitutive activation of the Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase.1 Treatment of CML has been drastically improved by the development of imatinib mesylate , an Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitor TKI .2,3 However , imatinib resistance is frequently observed , especially in patients with advanced-stage disease.4 Second-generation Abl TKIs , such as dasatinib , 5 nilotinib6 and INNO-406 formerly NS-187 , 7�9 potently overcome most imatinib resistance mechanisms.10 However , whether TKI alone can kill all the cancerous cells , which is a prerequisite for curing CML , is in doubt because TKIs are much less effective against quiescent CML stem cells.11,12 Bone marrow BM is a hypoxic tissue , particularly at the epiphysis , which is distant from the BM arterial blood supply Supplementary Figure 1 .13 In addition , leukemic cells are more hypoxic than normal cells in the BM because of cell crowding , due to accelerated cell growth , as well as the anemia that commonly accompanies the progression of leukemia.14,15 The oxygen supply is frequently inadequate for the level of oxygen consumption in the microenvironment of rapidly proliferating cancer cells.16 Although not identified conclusively until today , Bcr-Abl ? CML stem cells are in a quiescent state in the niche . In addition , human primary leukemic cells expressing CD34 inoculated into immuno-deficient mice initially populate the hypoxic epiphysial region.17 Thus , it is likely that quiescent leukemic cells predominantly reside in and survive in a hypoxic BM environment . Most cancer cells that have adapted to hypoxia are resistant to a variety of cell death stimuli.18,19 A shift in energy production from aerobic to anaerobic respiration causes a number of dramatic changes in cell phenotype , including the accumulation of hypoxia-specific by-products , alterations in the cell cycle , and resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs . Given these observations , we hypothesized that adaptation to hypoxia is one of the causes of minimal residual disease in patients treated with Abl TKIs . The molecular mechanisms of adaptation to hypoxia may provide new targets for cancer-specific therapies that are effective against cells in hypoxic microenvironments.20,21 Results Bcr-Abl ? cells in the BM survive in hypoxic conditions . Four NOD SCID gc null NOG mice were inoculated with 1.0 106 K562 cells , a human cell line established from a Bcr-Abl ? CML patient . Mice were killed 35 days after transplantation and examined for engraftment . Viable K562 engraftments in the BM were identified in three of the four mice . In the mouse with failed engraftment Figure 1a , only a small population of normal cells were positive for pimonidazole , which specifically accumulates in hypoxic cells o1.3 % O2 concentration along the endosteum Figure 1b . Liver cells from this were also negative for pimonidazole Figure 1c . The transplanted K562 cells initially populated the epiphysis in recipient NOG mice . The engrafted cells were easily distinguished from normal mouse hematopoietic cells by their larger size and prominent nuclei Figure 1d . Immunohistochemical staining with an antibody specific for human Ki-67 , which is expressed in actively cycling but not quiescent cells G0 Figure 1e , 22 also confirmed that K562 cells were successfully engrafted . The area of Ki-67-positive staining was in good agreement with the engraftment area estimated by cell morphology Figures 1d and e . Although most of the engrafted cells were positive for Ki-67 , a few cells were not Supplementary Figure 2 , suggesting that some engrafted K562 cells may have entered a quiescent G0 state.22 The majority of engrafted K562 cells were also positively labeled by pimonidazole Figure 1f . Next , we engrafted NOD SCID mice with primary Bcr-Abl ? cells from a Ph ? acute lymphoblastic leukemia Ph ? ALL patient . Engrafted primary Bcr-Abl ? cells Figure 1g were very similar to engrafted K562 cells Figures 1e and f in Ki-67 expression and pimonidazole staining Figures 1h and i . These results indicate that both the engrafted Bcr-Abl ? cell line K562 and the primary leukemic cells survive in the severely hypoxic conditions of the BM . HA-CML cell lines . To generate hypoxia-adapted HA -CML cells , four CML-derived cell lines , K562 , KCL22 , BV173 and MYL , were continuously cultured under hypoxic conditions 1.0 % O2 . Most cells were arrested in the G1 phase of the cell cycle 2 days after transfer to hypoxic conditions as shown by an increase in the percentage of sub-G1 cells in all four cell lines . Most of these cells underwent apoptosis within 7 days , and none of the BV173 or MYL cells survived more than 7 days Supplementary Figure 3 . In contrast , a small fraction of K562 and KCL22 cells survived in 1.0 % O2 for more than 7 days . We isolated these HA sublines of K562 and KCL22 termed K562 HA and KCL22 HA , respectively , and these cells continued to proliferate under 1.0 % O2 for more than a year Figures 2a and b . The growth rate of both HA-CML cell lines in vitro was slower than that of the corresponding parental cells . Although the cell cycle distribution of both the HA cell lines was similar to that of the parental cell lines after 1 year Figures 2a and b , the growth of the HA-CML cells was still much slower than their respective parental cell lines Figure 2c . We next examined the cytotoxic effects of the Abl TKIs , including imatinib , dasatinib and INNO-406 , on K562 , K562 HA , KCL22 and KCL22 HA cells . K562 HA cells were highly resistant to all Abl TKIs examined , compared with the parental K562 cells Figure 2d , Table 1 . As the parental KCL22 cells are intrinsically resistant to imatinib and INNO-406 , we examined the antiproliferative effects of dasatinib , which has higher affinity for Abl than the other Abl TKIs , in KCL22 and KCL22 HA cells . KCL22 HA cells were approximately 50-fold less sensitive to dasatinib than the parental KCL22 cells Table 1 . Both K562 HA and KCL22 HA cells were less sensitive to the alkylating agents daunorubicin and busulfan than the respective parent cells Figure 2e , Table 1 . These results indicate that the K562 HA and KCL22 HA cells acquired resistance to a wide range of antileukemia agents during adaptation to hypoxia . Table 1 IC50 scores of tyrosine kinase inhibitors , alkylating agents and Glo-I inhibitors for human CML cell lines and their hypoxia-adapted HA subclones ABL TKIs Alkylating agents Glo-I inhibitor BBGC , S-p-bromobenzyl glutathione cyclopentyl diester CML , chronic myeloid leukemia COTC , 2-crotonyloxymethyl-4,5,6-trihydroxycylohex-2-enone Glo-I , glyoxalase-I TKI , tyrosine kinase inhibitor The levels of phosphorylation of Bcr-Abl and its down-stream effector Erk were reduced in K562 HA and KCL22 HA cells under hypoxic conditions 1.0 % O2 , compared with levels in the parental cells cultured in normoxic conditions . The levels of phosphorylated Akt p-Akt and Stat5 p-Stat5 were similar in both HA and parental cells Figure 2f . We examined the levels of apoptosis-related proteins such as Bcl-2 , Bcl-xL , Bim , Bad , Mcl-1L and Mcl-1S . The levels of Bcl-2 were lower in K562 HA cells than in K562 cells , whereas the levels of Bcl-xL were higher . Bim and Bid interact with Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL to induce apoptosis . The levels of Bim and Bid in K562 HA cells were not different from those in the parental cells . The level of the antiapoptotic Mcl-1L was the same in K562 HA and parental cells , whereas the level of the proapoptotic Mcl-1S decreased in K562 HA cells Figure 2g . In contrast to K562 and K562 HA cells , there were no differences between KCL22 and KCL22 HA cells Figure 2g . These findings suggest that adaptation to hypoxia may have some impact on the mechanisms for executing apoptosis , although further investigation will be required to confirm this hypothesis . Glo-I in HA-CML cells . We examined the ATP levels in parental and HA-CML cells . The amounts of ATP in K562 HA and KCL22 HA cells were 73.0 and 93.2 % , respectively , of the levels in their respective parental cell lines under normoxia Figure 3a . In addition , both HA cell lines exhibited high levels of glucose consumption and lactate production compared with their respective parental cells Supplementary Figure 4 . Normally , one molecule of glucose produces approximately 34�36 ATPs by aerobic respiration , but only 2 ATPs by glycolysis Figure 3b . Our results suggest that anaerobic glycolysis generates sufficient ATP for survival of HA-CML cells in hypoxic conditions . When cells preferentially use glycolysis for energy produc-tion , glycolysis-specific cytotoxic by-products , such as methylglyoxal , accumulate intracellularly . As glyoxalase-I Glo-I protects cells and promotes cell survival by detoxifying methylglyoxal Figure 3b , we examined Glo-I in HA-CML cells . Both K562 HA and KCL22 HA cells had higher Glo-I protein levels Figure 3c and enzymatic activity Figure 3d than the parental cells . Furthermore , the Glo-I protein level increased markedly in the parental K562 cells after cultivation in 1.0 % O2 for 28 days Figure 3e . In addition , we examined the Glo-I protein levels in primary Bcr-Abl ? cells from CML and Ph ? ALL patients . Both samples of primary Bcr-Abl ? cells possessed higher Glo-I protein levels than normal BM or PB cells Supplementary Figure 5 . These findings indicate that Glo-I expression was induced not only in the artificially generated HA-CML cell lines but also in primary Bcr-Abl ? cells , suggesting that primary leukemic cells may be adapted to hypoxia in vivo . High Glo-I expression is sustained in HA-CML cells after 6 months in normoxia . The HA cells returned to normoxic culture conditions revert to the parental cell proliferation rate after 5 days Supplementary Figure 6a , and the fraction of cells in G0 decreases within 48 h after return to normoxic conditions Supplementary Figure 6b . Interestingly , the high level of Glo-1 expression developed by HA-CML cells was sustained after 6 months in culture under normoxic conditions Supplementary Figure 6c . Engraftment of HA-CML cells in NOG mice . We established stable subclones of K562 and K562 HA cells K562Luc-EGFP and K562 HALuc-EGFP , respectively that coexpressed luciferase and enhanced green fluorescent protein EGFP . When we examined the bioluminescence of the cells , K562Luc-EGFP cells produced approximately 10 times more bioluminescence than did K562 HALuc-EGFP cells Figure 4a . As the strength of luciferase bioluminescence depends on the availability of ATP and oxygen , we hypothesized that these factors may have a role in the reduced bioluminescence of K562 HALuc-EGFP cells . Engraftment and proliferation of K562Luc-EGFP and K562 HALuc-EGFP cells in NOG mice were monitored using in vivo imaging Figure 4a . Despite the lower level of bioluminescence in K562 HALuc-EGFP cells in culture , there were no significant differences in total photon emission between K562Luc-EGFP-and K562 HALuc-EGFP-engrafted mice before day 34 . After day 34 , the total photon emission of K562 HALuc-EGFP-engrafted mice increased much more sharply than that of K562Luc-EGFP mice Figure 4b . In addition , K562 HALuc-EGFP-transplanted mice died significantly earlier than did K562Luc-EGFP mice Figure 4c . These results indicate that K562 HALuc-EGFP cells engrafted more efficiently in NOG mice than did the parental K562Luc-EGFP cells . To investigate why K562 HALuc-EGFP cells engrafted more efficiently , we examined the cell cycle distribution of K562 and K562 HA cells . The percentages of cells in G0 in K562 and K562 HA cells were 0.87 ? 0.58 and 4.9 ? 2.1 % , respectively , indicating that the K562 HA grafts included more quiescent cells than did the parental line Figures 4d and e . Next , we examined the expression of c-kit , Tie-2 , CXCR4 , Notch , N-cadherin , VLA-4 , LFA-1 and CD44 , all of which have been reported to indicate stemness.23 There was no difference in the expression levels of these proteins in K562 HA or KCL22 HA cells and the respective parental cell lines data not shown . Interestingly , both HA cell lines expressed higher levels of b-catenin , which is thought to be important for production of CML stem cells Figure 4f .24 In addition , the K562 HA cell line contained more cells with the side population marker for cancer stem cells Figure 4g .25 These findings suggest that the adaptation to hypoxia induces putative stem progenitor cell-like characteristics in Bcr-Abl ? cells . Effect of Glo-I inhibitors on HA-CML cells . S-p-bromobenzyl glutathione cyclopentyl diester BBGC Figure 3f is a specific cell-permeable inhibitor of Glo-I , 26 and 2-crotonyloxymethyl-4,5,6-trihydroxycylohex-2-enone COTC Figure 3g is an inhibitor of Glo-I and glutathione.27 Recently , methyl-gerfelin Supplementary Figure 7a was also identified as a Glo-I inhibitor.28 Although HA-CML cells were resistant to the cytotoxic effects of Abl TKIs and alkylating agents Figures 2d and e , Table 1 , BBGC , COTC and methyl-gerfelin were more strongly cytotoxic in K562 HA and KCL22 HA cells than in the parental cell lines Figures 5a�d , Supplementary Figures 7b and c . To determine the mechanism of cell death induced by BBGC , we examined Annexin V staining Supplementary Figures 8a�d and mitochondrial outer membrane permeabi-lization Supplementary Figures 8e�h . The proportion of cells undergoing apoptosis was greater in the BBGC-and COTC-treated K562 HA and KCL22 HA cells than in the parental cells Supplementary Figures 9a�d . These results indicate that HA-CML cells were dependent on Glo-I activity for survival under hypoxic conditions , whereas the parental cells , cultured in normoxic conditions , were not dependent on Glo-I activity . To evaluate the in vivo antileukemic activity of BBGC , we treated NOG mice inoculated with K562Luc-EGFP or K562 HALuc-EGFP cells with BBGC . BBGC had no apparent effect on the survival of K562Luc-EGFP-engrafted mice Figure 5e . However , it significantly prolonged the survival of K562 HALuc-EGFP-transplanted mice Figure 5f . The body weight of BBGC-treated mice did not decrease during the course of treatment data not shown . These findings indicate that BBGC has potent antileukemic effects in vivo , and preferen-tially targets CML cells with higher Glo-I activity , with minimal associated toxicity . Discussion Abl TKIs can induce apoptosis only in actively proliferating Bcr-Abl ? cells , making these drugs much less active against CML stem cells , which are predominantly in a quiescent state.10,11,29 Hypoxia favors the self-renewal of normal hematopoietic stem cells , 30 and resistance to hypoxia is one of the defining features of leukemic stem cells.31 Therefore , it may be more important to search for new antileukemic agents that target quiescent CML stem cells residing in the hypoxic BM milieu . To this end , we have established two HA-CML sublines Figures 2a�c . Previously , investigators have studied the role of hypoxia in leukemia using relatively short-term assays.30�32 Our results suggest that transient hypoxia may not adequately mimic the physiological environment of CML cells Figure 3e . Furthermore , in the mouse CML xenograft model , the oxygen concentration of engrafted leukemic cells in the BM was o10 mm Hg B1.3 % O2 Figure 1f . Interestingly , the HA-CML cells exhibited characteristics similar to CML stem cells , including greater numbers of cells in a dormant , side population fraction , higher b-catenin expression , resistance to Abl TKIs and higher transplantation efficiency Figures 2d , e and 4 , Supple-mentary Figures 8 and 9 . The level of Bcr-Abl phosphorylation was lower in HA-CML cells , which may explain why those cells are less sensitive to Abl TKIs Figure 2f . Giuntoli et al.32 have also reported that the hypoxic selection of CML cells resulted in decreased cell sensitivity to imatinib and activation of Bcr-Abl-independent survival signaling pathways . Erk , a downstream effector of Bcr-Abl , was also less phosphorylated in HA-CML cells compared with parental cells , whereas the levels of p-Akt and p-Stat5 were similar Figure 2f . These observations suggest that alternative mechanisms of activation exist for these signaling molecules in HA-CML cells.33 In addition to the phosphorylation status of Bcr-Abl , the sensitivity to antileukemic agents depends on the balance of pro-and antiapoptotic molecules.8 Akt pro-survival effects have been reported to be dependent on the first step in glycolysis.34 However , Glo-1 induction in HA-CML cells was not directly controlled by Akt because Akt phosphorylation was un-changed in both HA cell lines Figure 2f . The adaptation to hypoxia may also alter the status of Bcl-2 family members , because the expression levels of several proteins were altered in K562 HA cells . However , there were no changes in KCL22 HA cells . As the parental KCL22 cells are intrinsically resistant to imatinib and exhibit very high Bcl-2 expression , alterations in Bcl-2 family proteins may not be obvious . Further experiments will be required to clarify the hypoxia-induced changes . We tried to identify a specific target in HA-CML cells that could be inhibited by small molecules with therapeutic potential . The dependence on glycolysis-mediated ATP production for uncontrolled cellular growth under limited O2 conditions is a hallmark of malignant cells Figure 3b .35,36 Reduced ATP production Figure 3a , as well as increased glucose consumption and lactate production Supplementary Figure 4 in HA-CML cells , suggested that there was preferential utilization of glycolysis for ATP production in these cells . We focused on the components of glycolysis to identify leukemia cell targets that would circumvent drug resistance acquired through adaptation to hypoxia.37,38 Glo-I is an enzyme that detoxifies methylglyoxal , a cytotoxic a-oxoaldehyde side product of glycolysis . Accumulation of methylglyoxal damages cells through multi-base DNA dele-tions and base-pair substitutions . The overexpression of Glo-I induces drug resistance to alkylating agents in leukemia as well as other solid tumors.26,39 Glo-I activity was elevated in both K562 HA and KCL22 HA cells Figures 3c and d , possibly because of their increased dependence on glycolysis during adaptation to hypoxia . Both K562 HA and KCL22 HA cells were more sensitive to cell killing by Glo-I inhibitors , indicating that these cells are indeed dependent on Glo-I activity for survival under hypoxic conditions Figures 5a�d , Supplementary Figures 7b , c , 8 and 9 . All the Glo-I inhibitors examined were effective for killing HA-CML cells in vitro . We selected BBGC for in vivo analysis because BBGC was the most potent compound in vitro , and because BBGC has previously been used against lung cancer in vivo.40 As engrafted K562 cells survive in the hypoxic environment of the BM Figure 1f , we expected that BBGC would be effective against the parental K562Luc-EGFP cells , even if Glo-I activity in these cells was low . However , BBGC had no effect on the survival of K562Luc-EGFP-engrafted mice Figure 5e . This result may be due to the time differences between Glo-I induction by hypoxia and administration of BBGC . BBGC was administered from day 1 to day 11 after transplantation , whereas , in in vitro cultures , Glo-I was not induced until 21 days after the initiation of hypoxia Figure 3e . Intriguingly , BBGC significantly prolonged the survival of K562 HALuc-EGFP-engrafted mice compared with untreated mice Figure 5b . Thus , BBGC may be a promising therapeutic agent for use against CML cells with high Glo-I activity , which also more frequently accompanies the quies-cent status . As the Abl inhibitor imatinib is currently the drug of choice for CML treatment , we examined the combined effects of BBGC with imatinib in vitro . BBGC augmented the effects of imatinib in killing CML cells in vitro Supplementary Figure 10 . In conclusion , the survival of engrafted leukemic cells in the BM under severe hypoxia depends on the induction of Glo-I activity , and adaptation to hypoxia seems to result in the acquisition of Abl TKI resistance in CML cells . Glo-I inhibitors were much more effective against HA-CML cells than parental cells both in vitro and in vivo . These findings indicate the importance of the hypoxic environment for maintaining quiescent CML cells , and suggest that Glo-I is a novel target for CML treatment . Materials and Methods Reagents and cell lines . The Glo-I inhibitors , BBGC , COTC and methyl-gerfelin , were synthesized and purified as previously described.26�28 The K562 cell line was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection Manassas , VA , USA . The other CML-derived cell lines KCL22 , BV173 and MYL were kindly provided by Dr Tadashi Nagai Jichi Medical School , Tochigi , Japan , Dr Oliver G Ottmann Frankfurt University , Frankfurt , Germany and Dr Hideo Tanaka Hiroshima University , Hiroshima , Japan , respectively . The CML cell lines were maintained in RPMI-1640 supplemented with 10 % fetal calf serum Vitromex , Vilshofen , Germany at 371C in a humidified atmosphere of 20 % O2 , 5 % CO2 and 75 % N2 . CML cells were subjected to continuous culture in 1.0 % O2 7.2 mm Hg , 5 % CO2 and 94 % N2 , and HA subclones of K562 K562 HA and KCL22 KCL22 HA were selected and maintained in suspension in low O2 conditions for more than 6 months . Parental K562 and K562 HA cells were cotransfected with pGL3 , a control luciferase Luc reporter vector Promega , Madison , WI , USA and pCAG.egfp.neo using the Nucleofector Kit V , protocol T-03 Amaxa AG , Cologne , Germany .

Human primary Bcr-Abl ? leukemic cells were obtained from patients with informed consent , according to the Declaration of Helsinki . In vivo engraftment of CML cells and histological analysis . Animal studies were performed in accordance with the guidelines of the Institutional Review Board for animal studies at Kyoto University . To evaluate the oxygen status of engrafted leukemic cells , 1.0 106 cells were injected into sublethally irradiated 2 Gy male NOG or NOD SCID mice at 6�8 weeks of age . At 35 days NOG mice or 50 days NOD SCID mice post-inoculation , the mice were injected intraperitoneally with pimonidazole hydrochloride Pimo , Chemicon , Temecula , CA , USA 60 mg kg , and 60 min later , the animals were killed and the femur and liver removed . Tissues were subjected to hematoxylin�eosin staining and immunohistochemical analysis using anti-Pimo Chemicon and antihuman Ki67 Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Santa Cruz , CA , USA antibodies , and examined by microscopy . In vivo , leukemia cell proliferation was detected by monitoring luciferase expression using an in vivo imaging system Xenogen , Berkeley , CA , USA , as previously described.41 For survival analysis , time of death was determined either by spontaneous death , or by date of euthanasia due to pain or suffering , according to established criteria . We also confirmed the oxygen concentration of primary Bcr-Abl ? leukemic cells that were obtained from a Ph ? ALL patient and engrafted in the BM of NOD SCID mice . Primary Bcr-Abl ? leukemic cells 1 106 were transplanted into four NOD SCID mice , which were killed 50 days after transplantation , and the BM sections were stained as above . Cell death . Cell viability was measured by incorporation of propidium iodide PI . Mitochondrial transmembrane potential Dcm was determined by staining with 3,30-dihexyloxacarbocyanine iodide Molecular Probes , Eugene , OR , USA , as previously described.9 For analysis of DNA content , cells were fixed with ice-cold 70 % ethanol and then incubated with PI as previously described.42 The percentage of cells that incorporated PI , the Dcm , and the percentage of cells in sub-G1 of the cell cycle were determined by FACS using the CellQuest software Becton Dickinson , San Jose , CA , USA . Western blot analysis . Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and then electroblotted onto a Hybond-PDVF membrane Amersham Biosciences , Uppsala , Sweden .

Cells were lysed in PBS containing 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride by freezing and thawing , followed by sonication . The lysates were centrifuged at 12 000 g for 20 min and the supernatant was used as the cytosolic fraction . The Glo-I assay was performed in 0.1 M sodium phosphate pH 7.0 , 7.9 mM methylglyoxal Sigma , 1 mM GSH and 14.6 mM MgSO4 at 25 1C . An increase in absorbance at 240 nm because of the formation of S-D-lactoyl-glutathione was measured using a temperature-controlled spectrophotometer Beckman Coulter , Brea , CA , USA , DU640 . ATP assay . ATP levels were measured using an ATP assay kit TOYO INK , Tokyo , Japan , according to the manufacturer�s instructions . Measurement of glucose consumption and lactate produc - tion . Cells were suspended in fresh culture medium . After 6 h , the cells were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in 5 ml of RPMI at a density of 2 105cells ml . Cells were incubated for 24 h , and the culture medium was collected for measurement . Glucose levels were determined using a glucose assay kit GO , Sigma . Glucose consumption was determined from the difference in glucose concentration compared with the starting medium . Lactate levels were determined using a lactate assay F-kit L-lactate , JK International , Tokyo , Japan . Determination of quiescentcells . Numbers of quiescent leukemic cells in G0 phase were determined by double staining with Ki-67 and 7-AAD as previously described.43 Briefly , 1 106 K562 or K562 HA cells were fixed in ice-cold 70 % EtOH for at least 12 h , and then resuspended in 100 ml PBS . Cells were stained with 20 ml Ki-67 antibody BD Biosciences and incubated for 30 min at RT. Subsequently , 20 ml 7-AAD BD Biosciences was added , and the cells were resuspended in 500 ml PBS with 1 % FBS and analyzed by FACS . Three independent analyses were performed . BBGC treatment of CML mice . NOG mice 6�8 weeks of age were sublethally irradiated 2 Gy and inoculated with 1.0 106 K562 HALuc-EGFP or K562 HALuc-EGFP cells by intravenous tail vein injection . Therapeutic treatments seven mice per group were started 1 day day 1 after transplantation . To prepare the BBGC solution , BBGC dissolved in cremophor EL DMSO 1 1 was diluted to 10 mg ml using DMSO and PBS . Within each group , half of the mice were administered EL DMSO only vehicle controls , and the remainder were administered 10 mg kg BBGC on days 1 through 4 , and days 8 through 11 after transplantation . For survival analysis , the time of death was determined either by spontaneous death or by date of euthanasia due to pain or suffering , according to established criteria . Statistical analysis . Survival curves were drawn using the Kaplan�Meier method and compared using the log-rank test . P-values were derived from two-sided tests and a P-value o0.05 was considered statistically significant . Conflict of interest The authors declare no conflict of interest . Acknowledgements .
