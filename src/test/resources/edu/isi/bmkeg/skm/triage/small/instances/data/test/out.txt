19911007	BD Paul1 and SH Snyder* , 1,2,3 L-ergothioneine ET is an unusual sulfur-containing amino acid discovered a century ago in the rye ergot.1 The only organisms known to synthesize it are bacteria belonging to the order Actinomycetales example mycobacteria and non-yeast like fungi which include members of the division Basidiomycota and Ascomycota.2,3 These microbes synthesize ET from L-histidine via an intermediate hercynine , a betaine of histi-dine.4,5 A sulfur group is added to hercynine to form ET.4 The biosynthetic enzymes catalyzing these reactions are unknown . ET is widely distributed in both the plant and animal kingdoms . Mammals acquire ET solely through their diet . Foods such as mushrooms , black beans , red meat and oats are rich in ET.6,7 Plants accumulate ET from the soil where microbes generate it . ET is concentrated in cells and tissues frequently exposed to oxidative stress with highest levels in the millimolar range occurring in blood , lens of the eye , liver , bone marrow and seminal fluid.8�10 ET is tautomeric and exists predominantly in the thione form in neutral aqueous solutions which may account for ET�s resistance to autooxidation , 11 in contrast to glutathione , the other major water-soluble thiol which is rapidly oxidized . ET�s sulfhydryl group implies an antioxidant role.8�11 Exo-genous ET can scavenge reactive oxygen and nitrogen species and protect cells from a variety of apoptotic insults . Earlier studies of ET�s antioxidant actions have been conducted in vitro or using overexpression systems with no evidence for a physiologic function . An important advancement in understanding ET physiology was the discovery by Schomig and associates that the putative transporter protein OCTN1 , a product of the gene SLC22A4 solute carrier family 22 , member 4 that had been implicated in rheumatoid arthritis , is primarily a physiologic ET transporter ETT .12 This transporter was first cloned and characterized earlier in 1997 and shown to transport organic cations such as tetraethyl ammonium , carnitine , and verapamil.13 Using a liquid chromatography mass spectroscopy difference shad-ing approach , Schomig and colleagues showed a very high specificity for ET.12�14 ETT occurs in a variety of tissues , 12�15 with a high level of expression in the cells of the hematopoietic lineage and CD14 ? cells , such as monocytes and macro-phages.12�16 Levels of the transporter correlate closely with those of ET . Mutations in the ET transporter locus have been identified as susceptibility factors for autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn�s disease.17,18 Inter-estingly , the gene for ETT lies in close proximity to genes involved in inflammatory responses such as caspase recruit-ment domain family , member 15 , CARD 15 . ETT is abundantly expressed in CD14 ? macrophages and monocytes consistent with a role in inflammation.12�19 ET inhibits tumor necrosis factor-a-induced release of the inflammatory cytokine interleukin-8 IL-8 in alveolar macro-phages.20 ETT expression is upregulated by inflammatory cytokines.17�21 The transcription factor nuclear factor-kappa B , which regulates inflammatory genes , has binding sites in the promoter of human ETT and regulates its expression , further supporting a role for ETT in modulating inflammatory processes.21 Patients with rheumatoid arthritis accumulate ET in their synoviocytes . ETT influences cell proliferation and differentiation22 and treatment of intestinal Caco-2 cells with ET stimulates cell proliferation.23 ETT is also one of the genes upregulated during liver regeneration . Although ET is not made by the body , it is taken up from the diet and retained preferentially in cells exposed to oxidative stress and involved in inflammatory responses . The presence of a high affinity transporter in conjunction with its non-random distribution implies physiologic function . In this study , we depleted endogenous ETT in HeLa cells and show marked augmentation of oxidative stress and cell death providing strong evidence for a physiological role of ET as a phy-siological antioxidant . Results RNAi-mediated knockdown of the ergothioneine transporter ETT OCTN1 . We examined a range of cell lines for ETT . HeLa cells , RAW 264.7 , HaCaT cells and PC12 cells express ETT and transport ET . We focused on HeLa cells , because this cell line is especially amenable to transfection . We used RNA interference to deplete ETT , which resulted in approximately 75 % depletion as confirmed by reverse transcriptase PCR Figure 1a and c . Western blot analysis also revealed a similar decrease in the ETT protein . Depletion of ETT was also verified by measuring the uptake of [ 3H ] ET . In HeLa cells transfected with ETT siRNA , transport of ET was reduced by 75 % Figure 1d . Loss of ET transport was directly proportional to the degree of depletion of ETT mRNA . ETT-depleted cells are more sensitive to oxidative stress . ETT depletion resulted in a decrease in cell proliferation data not shown , consistent with earlier studies.22,23 If ET is a physiological antioxidant , depletion of its transporter should result in the decreased ability of cells to cope with oxidative stress . ET protected against hydrogen peroxide-mediated toxicity Figure 2a . In unprotected HeLa cells , hydrogen peroxide 0.5 mM induced apoptosis , whereas pretreatment with 1 mM ET for 24 h was pro-tective . ETT-deficient cells were more susceptible to hydro-gen peroxide , with or without pretreatment by ET Figure 2b . The extent of reduced protection correlated with the extent of ETT depletion . The RNAi-mediated depletion was not total , hence the residual transporter present was able to afford a small degree of protection . The augmented cytotoxicity associated with ETT depletion indicates that basal levels of ET provide physiologic cytoprotection . ETT depletion differentially impacts protein and lipid oxidation . Glutathione , which is hydrophilic , preferentially prevents oxidation of water-soluble proteins , whereas the lipophilic bilirubin selectively protects lipids from per-oxidation.24 Might the hydrophilic ET differentially affect pro-tein and lipid oxidation ? Protein carbonylation , a common oxidative modification induced by free radicals , can be detected using 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine DNPH , which reacts with protein carbonyls generated by oxidants . The DNPH conjugated proteins can then be detected and quantitated using an anti-DNPH antibody . Cells depleted of ETT displayed increased levels of protein carbonylation Figure 3a , compare black bars to gray . ET pretreatment protected control but not ETT-depleted cells Figure 3a . Lipid peroxidation in these cells was also monitored . In this case , cells were treated with a mixture of hydrogen peroxide and ferrous sulfate to generate hydroxyl radical by the Fenton reaction to induce lipid peroxidation . ETT-depleted cells displayed enhanced lipid peroxidation monitored by the thiobarbituric acid reactive substances TBARS assay Figure 3b . The increase in lipid peroxidation following ETT depletion was less than the augmentation in protein oxidation , fitting with the notion that the hydrophilic ET selectively protects water-soluble proteins . ET protects cellular DNA from damage induced by reactive oxygen species . ETT is abundantly expressed in mitochondria.25 Mitochondrial DNA is especially vulnerable to stress , because unlike nuclear DNA , there are no histones to protect it . Mitochondria also lack the very efficient DNA 140 120 100 Viability 80 140 120 100 Viability 80 H O -+ + -+ + ET -- + -- + repair mechanisms of the nucleus . The electron transport chain of mitochondria generates free radicals and ROS , such as superoxide and hydroxyl radical that create redox imba-lance . In the process , mitochondrial DNA itself is targeted by ROS leading to DNA nicks , breaks and mutations . A region of the mtDNA , the Displacement or D-loop , is a hotspot for DNA damage . Several mutations occurring here are associated with cancers.26 Damaged DNA is a poor template for PCR amplification so that the extent of damage is reflected in the degree of amplification , which can be precisely mea-sured.27�29 To determine whether ET can protect mtDNA in Fold in Increase 4 Fold 2 ET mM H2O2 + UV from oxidative stress , we stressed cells with hydrogen peroxide . We then isolated total DNA and assessed the degree of mtDNA damage using quantitative real-time PCR Figure 4a . ET exposure protected DNA in control but not in ETT-depleted cells . To assess whether ET can directly protect against DNA damage , we treated supercoiled plasmid DNA with 2.5 mM hydrogen peroxide and irradiated with UV for 5 min in the presence of increasing concen-trations of ET 0.25�5 mM . ET prevented DNA nicking by the UV hydrogen peroxide mixture in a dose-dependent manner Figure 4b . ET can scavenge hydroxyl radicals as well as directly absorb UV radiation to block its effects on DNA . ET has an absorption spectrum in the UV range similar to DNA with a molar extinction coefficient of 1.4 10 4 M 1 cm 1 , lmax 257 , suggesting that ET can act as a physiological UV filter.30 In vitro and cell culture studies have identified ET as a superoxide scavenger.31 We treated HeLa cells with pyrogallol 150 mM , a known generator of superoxide . Cells incubated with ET exhibited higher growth rates and less apoptosis than untreated cells . ET protected the cells from pyrogallol-generated stress in a dose-dependent man-ner Figure 5a . ETT depletion markedly augmented sensitiv-ity to pyrogallol-induced cell damage and death , reinforcing the physiologic antioxidant role of endogenous ET Figure 5c and d . Pretreatment with ET did not prevent morphological damage in ETT-depleted cells Figure 5c compare bottom panel with the top . The abundant evidence that endogenous ET serves an antioxidant role , especially for water-soluble cellular constitu-ents , implies a physiological role comparable with other water-soluble antioxidants . Accordingly , we compared ET with ascorbate and glutathione , the other major water-soluble antioxidants . ET was somewhat more active than the other two substances in preventing pyrogallol-induced cell death Figure 5b . This study provides substantial evidence that ET is a physiologic antioxidant cytoprotectant . ET tissue levels are maintained by its transporter , ETT . Depletion of ETT by RNA interference prevents the antioxidant actions of exogenous ET . More importantly , in the absence of added ET , ETT depletion leads to enhanced oxidative damage of protein , lipid and DNA as well as augmented cell death . In these studies the incubation media contained very low concentrations of ET so that cytoprotection was afforded by �endogenous� ET accu-mulated by the cells . Our findings that exogenous ET exerts antioxidant , cytoprotective effects fits with observations of others.32�35 Schomig and associates observed ET protection against cytotoxicity elicited by Cu2 ? but not hydrogen peroxide , hydroxynonenal , doxyrubicin , iron II ascorbic acid and so-dium nitrite.7 In these experiments , cells were only exposed to ET for an hour . Because of ET�s slow rate of accumulation , maximal effects require prolonged exposure.35 This study is the first to show the endogenous antioxidant capacity of ET using RNA interference in cells naturally expressing ETT . In protecting against cell death ET was somewhat more active than the same concentrations of added ascorbate or glutathione . Endogenous levels of ET vary , attaining milli-molar concentrations in tissues that are typically exposed to marked oxidative stress such as blood cells , the lens of the eye , liver and bone marrow . In the bovine lens , ET concen-trations , about 7 mM , 10 exceed those of glutathione , generally regarded as the most abundant endogenous antioxidant . In the bovine cornea , ET concentrations are 14-fold higher than those of glutathione , suggesting that it is the principal antioxidant in this tissue.10 ET is avidly retained in cells and its tissue concentrations tend to be stable . When acting as an antioxidant , its SH group is oxidized but very rapidly reduced because of the unique tautomeric structure of the molecule . By contrast , glutathione is often almost totally depleted in the face of oxidative stress . Varying properties of diverse antioxidants may lead to different functions . Bilirubin is unique in that its low-tissue concentrations in the 50 nM range , exert cytoprotection com-parable with glutathione , which is thousands of times more abundant.36 When bilirubin acts as an antioxidant , it is itself oxidized to biliverdin . Biliverdin reductase rapidly reduces biliverdin back to bilirubin with this enzymatic cycling providing more than 1000-fold amplification of bilirubin potency.37 Control ETT RNAi 80 Viability 60 % 40 Antioxidants differ in their selectivity for various classes of molecules . The hydrophilic ascorbate and glutathione protect against damage to water-soluble proteins , whereas the lipophilic bilirubin preferentially protects against lipid perox-idation.24 Thus , abrogation of the biliverdin�bilirubin amplifi-cation cycle by depletion of biliverdin reductase selectively increases lipid peroxidation , whereas depletion of glutathione selectively augments the oxidation of water-soluble pro-teins.24 ET is highly water soluble and appears to pre-vent carbonylation of water-soluble proteins resembling the actions of glutathione . ETT is highly concentrated in the plasma membrane and mitochondria . Because of the absence of antibodies for ET that are suitable for immunohistochemistry , its detailed intracellular localization has not been established . However , following administration of radiolabeled ET to rats , mitochon-drial accumulation was higher than in any other particulate subcellular compartment.38 Mitochondria are uniquely sus-ceptible to damage from superoxide , physiologically gener-ated by mitochondrial metabolism . Mitochondrial DNA is substantially more sensitive to oxidative damage than nuclear DNA , as the latter is protected by histones . Also , mitochondria lack the efficient DNA repair mechanisms of the nucleus . Selective damage to mitochondrial DNA by oxidative stress has been implicated in neurodegenerative diseases , espe - cially Parkinson�s Disease.39,40 Thus , ET might be uniquely involved in the protection of mitochondrial DNA from the superoxide generated in the course of the electron transport cycle . Appreciation of ET as a physiologic antioxidant augments an already substantial cohort of such agents . Presumably , a multiplicity of diverse antioxidants helps the cell to cope with a wide range of stresses . As already indicated , hydrophilic antioxidants protect soluble proteins whereas lipophilic sub-stances protect lipids . Antioxidant turnover may determine the function . Thus , glutathione turns over very rapidly with some stressors its levels fall up to 90 % in minutes . Multiple mechanisms exist to regenerate glutathione but , with major tissue insults , these are heavily taxed . The bilirubin�biliverdin cycle provides a means for rapidly regenerating bilirubin after its service as an antioxidant and conversion to biliverdin . The cycle depends on the integrity of the highly abundant biliverdin reductase and can be imperiled if tissue damage impacts this enzyme . ET may afford a more stable mode of cytoprotection . It is not metabolized to any notable extent in mammalian tissues , the half-life of dietary ET being approxi-mately 1 month.38 Its cycling between oxidized and reduced sulfur takes place non-enzymatically and is facilitated by the intrinsically tautomeric structure of the molecule . These properties suggest a role for ET as a bulwark , a final defense for cells against oxidative damage . Its stability may help mitochondria cope with otherwise overwhelming stresses encountered even during relatively physiologic metabolism . Evidence that ET is a physiologic antioxidant raises the question of its �status� in biology . Despite its high concentra-tion and ubiquitous presence , all mammalian ET derives from dietary sources . The existence of ETT establishes ET as an important normal body constituent . In this sense , ET probably fits the definition of a vitamin . Classic criteria require that depletion of a putative vitamin elicit pathological conse-quences . No pathological syndrome of ET deficiency has been reported . However , lack of such reports may simply reflect the relative dearth of ET research as well as the difficulty of depleting ET . This study implies that ET deficiency can be cytotoxic . Because ET is not metabolized , it slowly exits the body . Moreover , ETT appears to be unidirectional , fostering ET�s cellular accumulation , but not its exit . For drug transport , ETT does act in a bidirectional fashion.41 Because of its highly charged nature , ET does not readily diffuse out of cells . In our own experiments a variety of cell lines labeled with [ 3H ] ET retain most of the radiolabel for many hours even after repeated washing with fresh media unpublished data . Mice with targeted deletion of ETT may help elucidate the importance of ET for normal physiology . In summary , ET is a most unusual amino acid with substantial antioxidant efficacy . The existence of a physiolo-gic ET transporter is responsible for high tissue levels . Depletion of ETT leads to augmented oxidative stress and cell death . ET preferentially protects water-soluble proteins from oxidative damage . The high density of ETT in mitochon-dria implies a unique role in protecting this organelle from the reactive oxygen species that accumulate even with normal oxidative metabolism . ET also protects the cell from damage induced by reactive nitrogen species and UV radiation Figure 6 . For all these reasons ET appears to be an important physiologic cytoprotectant which probably merits designation as a vitamin . Materials and Methods Cell lines . HeLa cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection Manassas , VA , USA and maintained in Dulbecco�s Modified Eagle�s Medium containing 10 % fetal bovine serum , L-glutamine and Pen�Strep Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA , USA . Depletion of the ergothioneine transporter ETT . The siRNA for human ETT RNAi was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc . Transfection of HeLa cells was carried out using Lipofectamine 2000 and OptiMEM I Invitrogen as per the manufacturer�s recommendations . Knockdown of the ETT was confirmed by RT-PCR 72 h post-transfection , using the SuperScript One-Step RT-PCR Kit Invitrogen on 500 ng total RNA isolated using TriZOL Reagent Invitrogen . The sequence of the primers used for RT-PCR were the following GAPDH forward 50-ACTGGCGTCTTCACCACCAT-30 , reverse 50-TACAGCAACAGGGTGTGGA-30 Human ETT forward 50-GTCTACCTGTCCACCGTCGT-30 and reverse 50-TGT GGTGGTTCATTCCTGAA-30 . The size of the RT-PCR products of GAPDH and ETT were 724 and 471 bp , respectively . ET uptake assay . The uptake of ET was monitored using [ 3H ] ET Moravek Biochemicals as described previously.22 Briefly , HeLa cells seeded in 6-well plates were preincubated for 20 min at 371C in transport buffer containing 3 mM K2HPO4 , 1 mM MgCl2 , 2 mM CaCl2 , 5 mM D-glucose , 130 mM NaCl and 20 mM Tris , pH 7.4 . After 20 min , the medium was replaced with fresh transport media containing 3 mM [ 3H ] ET , which was also preincubated at 371C and incubation continued for 60 min . After incubation , the transport was stopped by addition of ice-cold transport medium followed by three washes with phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mM EDTA . Cells were then lysed in buffer containing 10 mM Tris , pH 7.4 , 0.1 % Triton X-100 and radioactivity measured using a liquid scintillation counter . Treatments and cell viability assay . Cells were treated with the indicated doses of H2O2 Sigma or Pyrogallol Fluka for the designated times and cell viability calculated using 3-4 , 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl -2 , 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide MTT . MTT was added to cell cultures at 125 mg ml for 60 min . The media was removed and cells were lysed in dimethyl sulfoxide , using an empty well as a blank . Absorbance was read at 570 nm , using 630 nm as the reference for cell debris . Protein and lipid oxidation assays . Protein oxidation was determined by measuring protein carbonylation using the OxyBlot Protein Oxidation Detection Kit Millipore which uses 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine DNPH to derivatize oxidize proteins , which can be detected by anti-DNPH antibody . Cells were treated with 0.5 mM H2O2 for 16 h in the presence or absence of 1 mM ET to induce oxidative stress . After the incubation , cells were harvested and protein extracts prepared . Five micrograms of protein was used in the reaction , followed by western blotting . Lipid peroxidation was assessed by measuring the levels of malondialdehyde with the OxiSelect TBARS Assay Kit Cell Biolabs . Lipid peroxidation was induced in the cell by the Fenton reaction , treating the cells with 30 mM FeSO4 and 100 mM H2O2 for 2 h at 371C . DNA damage assay . One microgram of supercoiled plasmid DNA was incubated with 2.5 mM H2O2 and irradiated by UV C on a transilluminator for 5 min . The treated samples were mixed with DNA loading dye and electrophoresed on a 1 % agarose gel to visualize the open circular DNA , which is indicative of DNA damage . To assess mitochondrial DNA mtDNA damage , cells were treated with 0.5 mM H2O2 for 4 h and total DNA isolated using the Blood Mini Kit Qiagen . Quantitative real-time PCR was used to determine the extent of mtDNA damage in the region of the D-Loop as described earlier.27 The gene b-actin was used to normalize the data . The primers used for the PCR were D-Loop Forward 50-TATCTTTTGGCGGTATGCACTTTTAACAGT-30 D-Loop Reverse 50-TGATG AGATTAGAGTATGGGAGTGG-30 . b-actin Forward 50-TCACCCACACTGTGCCC ATCTACGA-30 b-actin Reverse 50-CAGCGGAACCGCTCATTGCCAATGG-30 . Standard curves were generated using DNA from untreated control cells and the relative standard curve method was used to analyze data . The results were expressed as the ratio of signal obtained for the D-Loop to that of the signal obtained for b-actin . Conflict of interest The authors declare no conflict of interest .

ET present in the cytoplasm also scavenges these free radicals . ET absorbs UV radiation and prevents DNA breaks and mutations . ET may stimulate certain enzymes involved in antioxidant response and repair mechanisms and also have a role in cell proliferation .

20057500	J Hickson* , 1 , S Ackler1 , D Klaubert2 , J Bouska1 , P Ellis1 , K Foster1 , and D Frost1 www.nature.com cdd A Oleksijew1 , L Rodriguez1 , S Schlessinger1 , B Wang1 Apoptosis is a highly regulated process of cell death inherent in all cells in the body and therefore is often referred to as �cell suicide� . Upon activation , the apoptotic program executes a well-characterized sequence of events by which the cell undergoes DNA fragmentation and proteolysis , thus culmi-nating in its death . Caspases have a central role in mediating the initiation and propagation of programmed cell death.1 To date , 14 mammalian caspases have been identified , and caspases involved in apoptosis can be broadly divided into initiator or effector caspases . Each caspase remains in an inactive procaspase form in the normal cell , and upon apoptotic stimuli becomes activated and cleaves its cellular substrates by binding to a small peptide sequence . As the dysregulation of apoptosis contributes to the development and progression of various diseases including cancer , neurodegenerative disorders , and chronic heart failure , the ability to noninvasively image caspase activation would provide an opportunity to evaluate therapeutic inter-ventions longitudinally in living animals using various disease models . In oncology , for example , the majority of cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents that induce apoptosis and defects in the apoptotic cascade are known to contribute to drug resistance and ultimately may lead to treatment failure.2�4 In neuroscience , evidence suggests that reactivation of programmed cell death in dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta in adulthood may contribute to the onset of Parkinson�s disease.5 Furthermore , many studies have reported extensive neuronal and glial apoptosis after injury to the central nervous system.6 Apoptosis is also an important process fundamental to many diseases of the cardiovascular system , including chronic heart failure , ather-osclerotic vascular disease , and myocardial ischemia and reperfusion injury.7 Therefore , development of imaging probes targeting cells undergoing apoptosis may allow evaluation of therapeutic efficacy in a wide range of preclinical applications . Recently , there has been a considerable increase in the availability of new imaging technologies to noninvasively detect biological processes in small animal models.8�10 One such modality , optical imaging , comprises using biolumines-cent and fluorescent reporters or probes and has evolved to enable observation of disease burden and progression in various therapeutic models , as well as to facilitate rapid monitoring of molecular events occurring within cells.11,12 Several recent reports have described the development of fluorescent and or bioluminescent reporter constructs that specifically allow monitoring of caspase activation in vivo . These molecular imaging studies have mainly focused on generating cells that express a modified reporter protein , commonly a fusion protein or a split luciferase protein complementation strategy13�15 that takes advantage of the specificity of caspases to cleave exclusively after aspartic acid residues and , in particular , the DEVD aspartic acid�glutamic acid�valine�aspartic acid tetrapeptide sequence , which is optimal for apoptotic effector caspases-3 and -7.16,17 In these models , light production is silenced unless the cell is under-going apoptosis , at which time activated caspase liberates the reporter . In this study , we adopt an alternate approach by using intact firefly luciferase and a modified firefly luciferase substrate , Z-DEVD-aminoluciferin . This substrate has been previously characterized and is currently widely used as an in vitro reporter for apoptosis.18�20 However , experiments to date have failed to transition this probe in vivo without acute toxicity to the animal.21 Using chemical material purified for in vivo use , we report a successful formulation of Z-DEVD-aminoluciferin that is well tolerated in vivo after multiple doses and enables quantification of apoptosis noninvasively in two oncology models . In addition , use of this probe enabled an earlier determination of drug efficacy than using traditional methods . Importantly , because this apoptosis probe requires no modification of existing firefly luciferase-expressing cell lines or transgenic animals , it should facilitate rapid evaluation of preclinical efficacy of experimental therapeutic agents in various disease states . Results In vitro bioluminescent imaging of docetaxel-induced apoptosis . Z-DEVD-aminoluciferin , a proluminescent caspase-3 7 substrate , has been successfully used for in vitro assessment of caspase-3 or caspase-7 activity.18�20 Specific 4,000 1,000 62.5 nM Untreated No Cells cleavage of the DEVD peptide by caspase-3 7 liberates free aminoluciferin , which is consumed by the luciferase , generating a luminescent signal that is proportional to activity . Docetaxel is a microtubule-disruptive apoptotic agent commonly used as chemotherapy medication to treat various cancer indications , and has previously been shown to be a potent activator of caspase-3 7 in human mammary MDA-MB-231 and ovarian SKOV3 adenocarcinoma cell lines.22�24 To image docetaxel-induced apoptosis in vitro , 150 mM of Z-DEVD-aminoluciferin was added to luciferase-expressing derivatives of these cell lines treated with a range 1�4000nM of docetaxel concentrations for 48h . Luminescent images were acquired using a Xenogen IVIS Spectrum imaging system Caliper Life Sciences , Hopkinton , MA , USA , and activation of caspase-3 7 was quantified . Representative images for MDA-MB-231-luc-LN cells are shown in Figure 1a . Increasing luminescent signal corresponded to higher docetaxel concentrations , reflecting elevated caspase activation . As a measure of cell viability , 150 mM of aminoluciferin was added to a parallel set of cells . Luminescent signal decreased with increasing docetaxel concentrations , reflecting increasing apoptosis and cell death . When the luminescent signal in each well was quantified , both aminoluciferin and Z-DEVD-aminoluciferin yielded similar cellular EC50 values 2.48 and 2.02 nM , respectively Figure 1b , which is consistent with previously reported values.25 Probe specificity was demonstrated by treating MDA-MB-231-luc-LN cells with doxorubicin , which induced cell death in this cell line through a caspase-3-independent mechanism , and therefore generated no bioluminescent signal after addition of the Z-DEVD-aminoluciferin substrate Supplementary Figure 1 . Pharmacokinetics of Z-DEVD-aminoluciferin . Unlike the DEVD peptide or aminoluciferin , both of which are freely soluble in water , the Z-DEVD-aminoluciferin construct demonstrated a strong tendency toward aggregation at high concentrations required for in vivo imaging which could luminescence 6.0 sec 1.2 photons x105 1000 M only be forestalled by DMSO . In the presence of 5 % DMSO , a mixture of polyethylene glycol 400 PEG400 and polysorbate 80 could achieve solubility at high concentrations . Female severe combined immunodeficient SCID mice were dosed with Z-DEVD-aminoluciferin intravenously 150mg kg or intraperitoneally i.p. , 500mg kg , and blood was harvested for more than 2h for pharmacokinetic analysis n ? 3 mice per time point . Z-DEVD-aminoluciferin was rapidly absorbed from the peritoneum , with a Cmax value of 149 mM , and was rapidly cleared from plasma t1 ? 7.2min Figure 2 . Furthermore , 2 Z-DEVD-aminoluciferin had a volume of distribution Vd equating to total body water , suggesting that the probe freely crosses cell membranes . Importantly , no toxicity was observed after multiple daily doses of Z-DEVD-aminoluciferin at 500mg kg . All these are ideal characteristics for an in vivo imaging probe . In vivo bioluminescent imaging of docetaxel-induced apoptosis . To evaluate Z-DEVD-aminoluciferin in vivo , SKOV3-luc cells were inoculated subcutaneously into the flank of female SCID mice and tumors were allowed to establish . Animals were size matched into two groups n ? 3 per group and bioluminescent images were acquired after i.p. injection of mice with 150 mg kg of luciferin . Mice were then treated intravenously with 60 mg kg of docetaxel or vehicle . At 24 , 48 , and 72 h after treatment , animals were injected daily with 500 mg kg Z-DEVD-aminoluciferin i.p. , and bioluminescent images were acquired every minute for 1 h . A parallel set of animals was treated identically and tumors were collected for immunohistochemical analysis . In vivo luciferase activity was quantified using region-of-interest ROI analysis of the bioluminescent images acquired before treatment with luciferin and after treatment using Z-DEVD-aminoluciferin . Representative images of both trea-ted and untreated groups at each time point are shown in Figure 3a . As expected , after size matching , the pretreatment images using luciferin demonstrate equivalent amount of luminescent signal originating from the tumor in both groups . Data acquired from images using the Z-DEVD-aminoluciferin substrate indicate that significantly more light was detected at 48 and 72 h Po0.05 in the docetaxel-treated group than in the vehicle-treated group Figure 3b . Similar to in vivo luciferin kinetics , 10�20 min post Z-DEVD-aminoluciferin injection yielded the highest fold increase , ranging from two to threefold , and provided proof-of-concept validation for the use of this probe to monitor apoptosis in vivo . As shown in Figures 3c and d , docetaxel induced activation of caspase-3 in SKOV3-luc tumors as early as 24 h after treatment , which remained activated at 48 and 72 h , compared with vehicle-treated tumors . Representative H E and luciferase immuno-histochemistry staining is also shown , confirming luciferase expression in tumor cells . To confirm these results in an additional model with an expanded number of animals , MDA-MB-231-luc-LN cells were inoculated subcutaneously into the flank of female SCID mice and tumors were allowed to establish . After size matching on the basis of tumor volume , mice n ? 8 per group were treated and imaged in a similar manner as described above , with additional tumors harvested for immunohistochemical analysis . ROI analysis was completed on the bioluminescent images before treatment using luciferin and after treatment using Z-DEVD-aminoluciferin . Represen-tative images of both treated and untreated groups at each time point are shown in Figure 4a . Similar amounts of signal were detected in all mice before treatment using the luciferin substrate . However , daily administration of the Z-DEVD-aminoluciferin substrate resulted in significantly more light detected at 24 Po0.05 , 48 Po0.01 , and 72 h Po0.01 in the docetaxel-treated group compared with the vehicle-treated group Figure 4b . Similar to the pilot study described above , 10�20 min post Z-DEVD-aminoluciferin injection again yielded the highest fold increase in bioluminescent signal . As shown in Figures 4c and d , docetaxel induced activation of caspase-3 in these tumors by 24 h after treatment , which increased at 48 and 72 h , compared with vehicle-treated tumors . Representative H E and luciferase IHC staining is also shown , confirming luciferase expression in this tumor type . Taken together , these studies confirm that Z-DEVD-aminoluciferin can be used as a sensitive noninvasive bioluminescent in vivo apoptosis probe . Earlier detection of therapeutic efficacy in vivo using Z-DEVD-aminoluciferin . Of critical importance to drug discovery and development is the need to rapidly assess therapeutic efficacy in vivo . Tumor volume was measured for MDA-MB-231-luc-LN tumor-bearing mice represented in Figure 4 , until each group reached an end point of B2500 mm3 Figure 5a . Whereas significant differences were detected as early as 24 h after treatment by molecular imaging using Z-DEVD-aminoluciferin , caliper measurements were unable to detect a difference for 4�5 additional days Figure 5b . Although the use of this probe significantly shortened the time necessary to determine treatment efficacy in subcutaneous MDA-MB-231-luc-LN tumors , it could provide an even more dramatic improvement in indicating antitumor efficacy in models that are relatively slow growing , as well as provide a method for determining drug efficacy in orthotopic , ectoptic , or systemic Vehicle Docetaxel models in which longitudinal measurements of tumor burden are not possible . Taken together , these data show that in vivo imaging of apoptosis using Z-DEVD-aminoluciferin could provide a sensitive and rapid method for early detection of drug efficacy . 24 Hours Post Treatment 48 Hours Post Treatment Docetaxel Docetaxel 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 Minutes Post Z-DEVD-aminoluciferin Injection Minutes Post Z-DEVD-aminoluciferin Injection 72 Hours Post Treatment Docetaxel 24 Hour 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 Minutes Post Z-DEVD-aminoluciferin Injection Minutes Post Z-DEVD-aminoluciferin Injection 72 Discussion In this study , we report the ability to noninvasively detect caspase-3 activation in response to chemotherapy in two preclinical oncology models . We demonstrate that the modified luciferase substrate Z-DEVD-aminoluciferin can be formulated and well tolerated as an in vivo agent . The two-to three-fold induction of bioluminescent signal at 48 and 72 h after docetaxel treatment in both models is consistent with the two-to four-fold increase in activated caspase-3 as deter-mined by immunohistochemistry . The use of agents that elicit a more robust activation of apoptosis e.g. , TRAIL in appropriate in vivo model s could potentially yield an even larger window of utility , although caspase activation to the degree observed in this study after docetaxel treatment may be more commonplace . Finally , we show that the use of this optical imaging probe can significantly decrease the time required for determining preclinical drug efficacy compared with using traditional methods . To the best of our knowledge , this is the first in vivo report using a bioluminescent apoptosis substrate with long-term animal survival and therapeutic efficacy data . Recently , there have been several published reports using elegant luminescent reporter systems in preclinical models to detect apoptosis in vivo by optical imaging . One approach has been to create reporter constructs in which luminescent activity is silenced by fusion to other peptide sequences . In one example , two estrogen-regulatory domains were linked on both the amino-and carboxy-terminal end of luciferase with a DEVD cleavage site.13,14 Similarly , a multimodality imaging reporter was also recently described to be composed of fluorescent , bioluminescent , and positron emission Vehicle Docetaxel 3000 Volume 1000 Tumor tomography PET reporters , separated by DEVD linkers.26 In both models , under apoptotic conditions , the reporter domains are liberated allowing for light production . Other methods for monitoring apoptosis in vivo have used a reporter protein complementation strategy , such as a split luciferase model . In this system , the amino-and carboxy-terminal domains of luciferase are fused to strongly interacting peptides that are linked by an enzyme-specific sequence.27�34 Cleavage of the linker permits the interacting peptides to associate , allowing reconstitution of luciferase activity . Coppola et al.15 described development of a split firefly luciferase reporter strategy in which DEVD is used as the intervening cleavage sequence and also reported the ability to detect activation of apoptosis in vivo after treatment with chemotherapeutic agents . However , a limitation to these strategies is the relatively large molecular size of the reporters that need to be transfected or transduced into the host cell . In addition , the intensity of luminescent signal can be diminished because of insufficient digestion of the DEVD sequence during apoptosis . Furthermore , as is the case with most protein complementation assays , activity of the combined luciferase is often lower than that of the intact reporter . Another important advantage of using a modified luciferin substrate , such as Z-DEVD-aminoluciferin described in this study , is that any existing cell line or transgenic mouse with firefly luciferase expression can be used immediately without extensive reder-ivation and characterization of model systems . Similar strategies for detecting apoptosis in vivo have been adopted using fluorescent reporters . Bardet et al.35 described the design of a reporter system that involved two fused fluorescent proteins that were linked to a caspase-sensitive site . Upon cleavage , the two moieties became differentially localized because of subcellular localization signals allowing identification of those cells undergoing cell death . Other strategies have focused on using membrane-permeant fluorescent-labeled inhibitors of caspases FLICA probe technology.36 FLICA probes are high-affinity ligands that irreversibly covalently bind to the cysteine at the active center of caspase.37,38 Another approach has been to develop fluorescent probes that are capable of selectively recognizing and binding to apoptotic cell membrane features . One such compound , Fl-ApoSense , has successfully been used pre-clinically for imaging apoptosis-induced cells and tissues in myocardial , cerebral , and renal ischemia models , as well as in oncology models.39�43 It is noteworthy that a radiolabeled analog is currently being evaluated as a PET probe in a phase II study to assess the response of metastatic brain tumors to radiotherapy , highlighting how optical imaging probes can prototype clinical PET , single-photon emission computed tomography SPECT or magnetic resonance imaging MRI probes.44 Although these and other fluorescent strategies have proved useful in reporting caspase activation in vitro and with tissues ex vivo , they are yet to be fully validated as useful tools for longitudinal in vivo imaging of apoptosis . Furthermore , an intrinsic limitation to any fluor-escent probe in vivo , compared with a bioluminescent reporter , is the lower signal-to-noise ratio due in part to the high degree of autofluorescence and low level of tissue penetrance at most wavelengths . As Z-DEVD-aminoluciferin is a bioluminescent reporter , it does not face many of these same challenges . Although the molecular imaging approach outlined in this study using a bioluminescent probe can not be directly translated into the clinic , it does have the potential to serve as an important tool for preclinical drug discovery . As we demonstrated , the Z-DEVD-aminoluciferin substrate enabled noninvasive observation of the apoptotic affects of chemo-therapy several days before they could be detected through traditional methods . A large majority of the chemotherapeutic agents currently available or under development exert their effect by inducing cellular pathways that lead to programmed cell death . Consequently , this bioluminescent imaging probe has the possibility to be useful to a wide range of therapeutic applications within cancer drug discovery and development . In addition , in vivo optical imaging is uniquely suited for high-throughput evaluation of candidate drugs because of the ease of operation , short acquisition times , and simultaneous measurement of multiple animals as compared with the significantly longer image acquisition time of a single animal with preclinical PET , SPECT , or MRI . Finally , although our initial approach used two cancer models , caspase activation is of critical importance in many other fields . As mentioned above , cellular apoptosis not only has an essential role in normal physiology and development but is also instrumental in a number of disorders , including Parkinson�s , Alzheimer�s , cerebral ischemia , and many cardiovascular diseases.5�7 Therefore , this probe may also have utility in applications across numerous therapeutic targets and research disciplines through the usage of luciferase-expressing cell lines or transgenic animal models specific to these disease states . Materials and Methods Cell culture . SKOV3-luc-D3 and MDA-MB-231-luc-D3H2LN were purchased from Caliper Life Sciences Hopkinton , MA , USA .

20094059	Control of transcription has been proven to be important for axonal and dendritic growth during development and for axonal regeneration in the peripheral nervous system . On the contrary , lack of specific gene transcription seems to contribute to the failure in axon re-growth after injury in the central nervous system CNS .1,2 Gene transcription is regulated by epigenetic modifications that contribute to the conformation of chromatin , which allows differential accessibility to promoters.3 A permissive or relaxed chromatin conformation euchromatin correlates with a relative high level of acetylated histones and is a preferential chromatin state during early embryogenesis , nervous system development and synaptic plasticity.4,5 The degree of acetylation is the result of a balance between histone acetyltransferases HATs and histone deacetylases HDACs . These two classes of enzymes , respectively , either acetylate or deacetylate lysine residues of histones and various transcription factors TFs , which form part of the transcription initiation complex . HATs and HDACs are found embedded in large multiprotein complexes within or near euchromatin.6,7 HATs modify core histone tails by acetylation of specific lysine residues , and induce a relaxed chromatin conformation , which along with acetylation of a set of TFs promotes DNA accessibility , promoter binding and gene expression.8,9 In contrast , HDACs attenuate the transcription process at a particular site by deacetylating these targets , resulting in a more compact chromatin heterochromatin . The HAT�HDAC system is therefore an essential regulatory switch of gene expression . Enhancement of acetylation can be achieved through the inhibition of deacetylation . This can be accomplished by using several classes of HDAC inhibitors including the hydroxamic acid , trichostatin A TSA , SAHA and sodium phenyl butyrate PB , all of which shift the overall balance in favour of HAT activity.7 Earlier , increased acetylation of histones and TFs in neurons has been shown to protect from apoptosis in animal models of neurodegeneration10 and to promote neuronal differentiation , 11�13 whose molecular mechanisms are partially shared during neurite axonal outgrowth . Among several HATs , the CREB-binding protein p300 CBP p300 and the p300-CBP-associated factor P CAF have been associated with the control of neuronal fate.14�16 They acetylate histones and TFs that confer protection from neuronal cell death.10,17 Recently , we found that neuronal acetylation of p53 at specific lysines in its C-terminus promotes neurite and axonal outgrowth in permis-sive conditions and is required for axonal regeneration in vivo.18,19 However , it is still unknown whether the enhance-ment of neuronal acetylation and the facilitation of transcription by HDAC inhibition as well as by specific histone acetylating enzymes may promote neuronal outgrowth in physiological conditions and on inhibitory substrates . We hypothesize that an increase in histone and TF acetylation might have a function in promoting axonal out-growth by boosting or re-activating the pro-outgrowth tran-scriptional machinery in neurons in permissive conditions as well as in neurons exposed to outgrowth inhibitory signals such as myelin and proteoglycans . Here , we specifically show that neuronal hyperacetylation mediated by HDACs inhibition results in transcription-dependent increased neuronal outgrowth on both permissive and non-permissive substrates , which is accompanied by enhanced promoter acetylation and gene expression of CBP p300 and P CAF . Next , gene silencing and overexpression experiments show that neuronal outgrowth on permissive and non-permissive substrates is specifically mediated by CBP p300 and P CAF , whose expression is diminished by myelin signalling . Finally , CBP p300 and P CAF together acetylate histones and the TF p53 , whose acetylation of specific lysines on its C-terminus by both of these HATs is required for neurite outgrowth and to overcome myelin inhibition . Results Inhibition of deacetylation promotes neuronal out - growth . Given the requirement for gene expression during neuronal maturation and neurite outgrowth and the decreased outgrowth capacity in mature neurons , we wanted to verify whether this decrease correlated with histone acetylation levels that may affect gene expression . To address this question , we measured the level of histone acetylation in purified cortical and cerebellar neurons at selected developmental stages E17 , P7 and adult 12 weeks . Immunoblotting showed that H3 K9-14 acetylation was clearly elevated in homogenates of freshly dissociated primary neurons at E17 and P7 in comparison to the adult Figure 1a . We believe this suggests that the level of histone H3 acetylation may correlate with the plasticity of neurons and their capacity to develop processes . Given these findings , we decided to further examine whether increased acetylation could indeed enhance neuronal outgrowth in primary neurons . To this end , we used inhibitors of HDAC I and II such as the hydroxamic acid derivative TSA and PB in primary neurons to enhance the level of overall acetylation and promote neuronal outgrowth . In initial experiments , we ascertained the toxicity of TSA in primary post-natal P7 cerebellar granule neurons CGN . CGN were plated on poly-D-lysine PDL and stimulated with TSA 1 , 10 and 100 ng ml for 8 or 24 h . We found that TSA at a concentration of 100 ng ml resulted in cell death of almost all CGN after both 8 and 24 h in culture data not shown . We then quantified cell viability by counting the number of apoptotic nuclei out of the total number of cells stained with Hoechst in CGN treated with vehicle or TSA at 1 and 10 ng ml . TSA at a concentration of 10 ng ml induced significant cell loss and promoted apoptotic features in surviving neurons Figure 1b . Whereas , 1 ng ml TSA was found to be non-toxic and displayed a minor increase in cell viability Figure 1b . Given that 1 ng ml of TSA does not harm cells , we next examined whether this dose of TSA is sufficient to induce histone acetylation . By immunocytochemistry and immuno-blotting for H3 AcK9-14 , we found that TSA at 1 ng ml is not only non-toxic , but also sufficient to induce histone hyperacetylation in primary neurons as early as at 4 h in culture Figure 1c and d . This dose regiment is supported by earlier findings in cancer cells20 and was used in all the subsequent experiments . Having established the correct dose of TSA , we next investigated the specific effects of TSA on CGN neurite outgrowth . TSA induced a significant increase in total average neurite length as well as the number of neurites 100 cells Figure 2a . Hyperacetylation in CGN also significantly increased the rate of non-collapsed growth cones and the growth cone surface area Figure 2b . To examine whether this hyperacetylation-mediated neuronal outgrowth is transcription dependent , we treated cultured CGN with an RNA polymerase II inhibitor , Flavo-piridol , 21 and measured neuronal outgrowth both in the presence and absence of TSA . Results showed that Flavopiridol 1 mM was able to inhibit physiological and TSA-mediated outgrowth by significantly inhibiting the in-crease in total average neurite length and the number of neurites 100 cells Figure 2a . In addition , Flavopiridol decreases the percentage of non-collapsed growth cones as well as the growth cone surface area Figure 2b . Also , we show by immunoblotting analysis that TSA triggers the expression of the axonal outgrowth marker GAP-43 , which is counteracted by Flavopiridol Figure 2c . Importantly , Flavopiridol at this concentration did not promote neuronal cell death , as measured by the number of surviving cells and the number of cells with fragmented or pyknotic chromatin data not shown . To verify whether the effects observed with TSA were specific to its function in the inhibition of HDACs I and II , we used another well-characterized HDACs I and II inhibitor , PB . These experiments showed a similar enhance-ment in histone acetylation and in process outgrowth 24 h after administration of 0.5 mM PB Supplementary Figure 1A and B . In addition , here we asked whether the well-described enhancement of the pro-outgrowth intrinsic properties of neurons through cAMP would lead to similar neurite outgrowth as HDAC inhibition . We also tested whether the use of another transcriptional inhibitor , Actinomycin D , would block these effects . Indeed , neurons treated with the cAMP analogue dbcAMP showed similar neurite outgrowth as neurons treated with TSA and Actinomycin D inhibited the effect of TSA and dbcAMP dependent outgrowth Supplementary Figure 1C . Taken together , these results indicate that hyperacetylation promotes neuronal outgrowth and growth cone remodelling in cultured CGN through inhibition of HDACs I and II by a transcription-dependent mechanism . Hyperacetylation partially overcomes the inhibitory environment to neuronal outgrowth . So far , we have shown that hyperacetylation promotes neuronal outgrowth through transcriptional modulation and therefore it is likely to enhance promoter accessibility to pro-growth genes . AcK9-14 Hoechst Neuronal acetylation at H3 K9-14 is higher in embryonic and early post-natal than in adult neurons Figure 1 , which are also more sensitive to myelin and proteoglycan inhibition of axon outgrowth as compared with younger neurons . Thus , we next asked whether enhancement of acetylation could protect from neuronal growth cone collapse and outgrowth inhibition on inhibitory substrates such as myelin and chondroitin sulphate proteoglycans CSPGs . Myelin and CSPGs are in fact known to inhibit outgrowth and induce growth cone collapse , and are important inhibitors of axon outgrowth after CNS injury.22 P7 CGN were plated on either myelin or CSPGs with TSA 1 ng ml or vehicle . Outgrowth and growth cone collapse assays were performed at 8 and 24 h post-plating . Indeed , data analysis showed that TSA significantly overcomes CGN P7 Ad CGN 30 TSA myelin and CSPGs-mediated inhibition of process outgrowth and growth cone collapse Figure 3a�c , and Supplementary Figure 2 . Hyperacetylation induced an increase in total average neurite length as well as an increase in the number of neurites 100 cells on myelin and on CSPGs . In addition , we observed a TSA-dependent increase in the number of non-collapsed growth cones at 8 and 24 h in culture on myelin and CSPGs , respectively . Analogously to what was done on permissive substrates , we also assessed whether another HDAC inhibitor such as PB and the enhancement of cAMP using the analogue dbcAMP would lead to improved neurite outgrowth on myelin . Results show that indeed both PB and dbcAMP promote neurite outgrowth similarly to TSA Supplementary Figure 3A . In addition , the transcriptional inhibitors Actinomycin D and Flavopiridol were able to block the pro-outgrowth effects of TSA , showing that rescue of neurite outgrowth is transcription dependent Supplementary Figure 3B . Interestingly , when we measured global changes in H3 K9-14 acetylation in neurons plated on myelin versus neurons plated on PDL , we found no difference in H3 K9-14 acetylation Supplementary Figure 3C . This suggests that TSA may affect outgrowth by enhancing transcription via H3 K9-14 acetylation of specific promoters and not aspecifically throughout the genome . Together , these data indicate that TSA significantly over-comes an inhibitory environment by promoting neuronal outgrowth , and by limiting growth cone collapse . This suggests that hyperacetylation might promote neuronal outgrowth on both permissive and inhibitory substrates in a �substrate-independent� manner , perhaps by affecting the intrinsic transcription-dependent pro-growth program . CBP , p300 and P CAF are required for hyperacetylation - dependent neuronal outgrowth . H3 K9-14 acetylation is mediated by the HATs CBP p300 and P CAF , 23 which are also essential transcriptional co-factors involved in the overall protection of neurons from cell death in diverse stress conditions.7,10 To investigate whether CBP p300 and P CAF are required for neuronal outgrowth , we have measured neuronal out-growth in CGN after electroporation with specific RNA interference constructs and oligonucleotides to silence the expression of CBP p300 and P CAF after the administration of TSA or vehicle . Control for RNA interference was performed by transfecting scrambled sequences and naked DNA . Electroporated neurons were identified by co-transfection with GFP , and neuronal outgrowth was visualized by using antibodies against b-III-tubulin as a neuronal marker . Also , only CGN with strongly impaired expression by immuno-fluorescence for each of these HATs were included in the analysis . Gene silencing with these RNAi was robust as shown by RT-PCR and by immunofluorescence in individually electroporated CGN both in vehicle and TSA-treated cells Supplementary Figure 4A�C . Importantly , CBP p300 or P CAF gene silencing also correlated with reduced histone H3 K9-14 acetylation Supplementary Figure 4D and E . In addition , cell viability was not affected by gene silencing as shown by counting the number of electroporated CGN with apoptotic features as shown by nuclear morphology and by the expression of cleaved-caspase 3 in control versus experimental conditions Supplementary Figure 4F and G . Results showed that gene silencing of CBP p300 and P CAF induces a significant decrease in TSA-mediated neuronal outgrowth , and in the average number of neurites 100 cells Figure 4a . In addition , we observed that silencing of CBP p300 or P CAF shows a tendency , but not a significant TSA % * CGN 0 decrease in neurite length without TSA , as opposed to a significant decrease in the average number of neurites 100 cells . Given that silencing of CBP p300 and P CAF on a permissive substrate inhibited the ability of TSA to induce neuronal outgrowth , we further investigated whether CBP p300 and P CAF would also have a function in TSA-dependent outgrowth in neurons cultured on myelin , a potent inhibitor of neuronal outgrowth . We electroporated CGN with RNAi to silence CBP p300 and P CAF , and we detected neuronal outgrowth on myelin in analogous experiments to what we performed on permissive substrates . We found that silencing of both CBP p300 or P CAF significantly reduced the �recovery effects� of TSA and further enhanced the inhibitory properties of myelin as shown by total average neurite length in GFP positively transfected neurons by the average number of neurites 100 cells and by the percentage of non-collapsed growth cones Figure 4b . Together , these data show that CBP p300 and P CAF are essential mediators of hyperacetylation-depen-dent neuronal outgrowth on both permissive and inhibitory substrates . The evidence that gene silencing of CBP p300 or P CAF abrogates the effect of TSA hyperacetylation in neuronal outgrowth , combined with the fact that hyperacetylation induces gene expression by facilitating transcription at specific promoters , led us to ask whether TSA is able to specifically promote gene expression of CBP p300 and P CAF . CGN 10 Indeed , RT-PCR experiments showed that TSA induces a significant increase in gene expression for CBP , p300 and P CAF in cultured CGN Figure 5a . Interestingly , we also found that gene expression of CBP , p300 and P CAF was repressed by plating CGN on myelin as compared with PDL , and that TSA rescued this inhibition by triggering their overexpression Figure 5b . As histone acetylation levels after TSA see Figure 1c are somewhat inhomogeneous showing significant difference from cell to cell , we investigated whether the acetylation levels of H3 K9-14 correlated with the single cell expression of CBP p300 as well as with neurite outgrowth . Indeed , H3 K9-14 acetylation levels positively correlated with CBP and p300 expression and with the degree of neurite outgrowth Supplementary Figure 5 . We then performed chromatin immunoprecipitation ChIP experiments in CGN to verify whether the gene expression changes of CBP p300 and P CAF correlated with an increase in the acetylation status of histone H3 on their promoter regions after TSA administration . ChIP followed by real-time quantitative PCR qPCR showed an increase of H3 cell Average 100 length acetylation at K9-14 on the promoters of CBP , p300 and P CAF after stimulation with TSA compared with vehicle . This increase of H3 acetylation is not present on the promoter of the control 140 gene RPL13a Figure 5b . These data suggest that TSA induces gene expression of the HATs , CBP , p300 and P CAF in CGN , by specific histone hyperacetylation on their promoters . neurite ? m 40 cell 30 Average length 20 Hyperacetylation-mediated neuronal outgrowth is dependent on acetylated p53 signalling and drives pro-outgrowth gene targets . We have recently found that p53 forms pro-axonal outgrowth transcriptional complexes with CBP p300 and P CAF on the promoter of pro-growth genes such as GAP-43 and Coronin 1b.18,19 We therefore examined whether p53 could transduce transcription signals within the pro-outgrowth hyperacetylation-dependent CBP p300-P CAF signalling cascade . First , we examined whether p53 was acetylated after TSA treatment in CGN . Western blots of cultured CGN treated with TSA showed that p53 was indeed acetylated at K373 and K320 , with peak in acetylation , respectively , at 8 and 4 h post-TSA Figure 6a . Next , we measured the expression of the two previously described p53 transcription targets and pro-axonal outgrowth proteins GAP-43 and Coronin 1b to assess whether in hyperacetylated neurons , p53-dependent pro-outgrowth signalling is activated . qRT-PCR and immuno-blotting revealed that the gene and protein expression of Coronin 1b and GAP-43 were induced after TSA treatment in hyperacetylated CGN Figure 6b and c . Then , ChIP assays were carried out in CGN to investigate the acetylation status of the promoters of these pro-axonal outgrowth factors by immunoprecipitation of DNA�protein complexes with an anti-acetyl H3 K9-14 antibody . Results showed that at both 8 peak increase and 24 h , histones were acetylated on the promoters 50site of GAP-43 and Coronin 1b . However , TSA did not induce further histone hyper - Hoechst acetylation on these promoters at neither 8 nor 24h Figure 6d . Therefore , we hypothesized that the TSA-dependent acetyla-tion of p53 would be responsible for the transcriptional activation of GAP-43 and Coronin 1b . To this end , we performed ChIP assays on CGN by using antibodies that recognize specifically acetylated p53 at lysine 320 and 373 and measured by qPCR the promoter occupancy of p53 on the promoters of Coronin 1b and GAP-43 respectively . Indeed , hyperacetylation increased the occupancy of p53 AcK373 on the promoters of both GAP-43 and Coronin 1b , whereas p53 AcK320 showed increased occupancy for Coronin 1b only . No occupancy was found on GAP-43 Figure 6e . Together , these experiments show that after TSA treatment , p53 is hyper-acetylated and the expression of specific p53-dependent pro-outgrowth targets such as GAP-43 and Coronin 1b are induced by increased promoter occupancy by acetylated p53 and not by histone hyperacetylation on their promoters , where histones are already acetylated in physiological growth conditions Figure 6d . To address the effects of hyperacetylation on driving the expression of several other well-known pro-neurite and axonal outgrowth genes that contain putative transcriptional binding sites for p53 , we performed qRT-PCR experiments on selected targets , including SCG-10 , a-tubulin 1a , Chl1 , L1cam , CAP-23 and Lgals1 Supplementary Figure 6A and B . In fact , the expression of most of these putative p53 target genes , with the exception of CAP-23 , was also driven in a CBP p300 P CAF hyperacetylated environment Supplementary Figure 6A and B , suggesting that multiple p53-dependent pro-neuronal out-growth pathways could be activated by hyperacetylation . Then , to evaluate whether acetylated p53-dependent cell signalling had a direct function in neuronal outgrowth during hyperacetylation , we electroporated CGN with a p53 mutant plasmid DNA , which carries a lysine to arginine transition at K320 , K372-3-82 p53 K320-72-3-82R , that we called here p53 K-R . These mutations do not allow acetylation of p53 by neither CBP p300 K372-3-82 nor by P CAF K320 . The p53 K-R transfected neurons did not display increased cell toxicity by cell counting nor they showed increased apoptotic features by Hoechst nuclear staining or cleaved caspase 3 expression compared with control transfected cells Supplementary Figure 7A and B . Importantly , neurite measurements showed that neuronal outgrowth was significantly impaired in neurons transfected with p53 K-R both in the presence of TSA and in physiological culture conditions Figure 7a . Electroporation of p53 K-R induced a significant decrease in the total average neurite length and an impaired number of neurites 100 cells Figure 7a . To further investigate whether the C-terminal acetylation of p53 would be required for hyperacetylation-dependent partial recovery of outgrowth in neurons cultured on inhibitory substrates , similar electroporation experiments were then performed on CGN plated on myelin . Results showed that neurons expressing p53 K-R show a very strong reduction in outgrowth even in the presence of TSA . Total average neurite outgrowth as well as the average number of neurites 100 cells were markedly impaired in neurons transfected with p53 K-R as compared with GFP transfected only Figure 7b . Furthermore , the percentage of collapsed growth cones was increased in the p53 K-R expressing neurons Figure 7b . To finally conclusively prove that CBP p300 , P CAF and acetylated p53 are truly important to drive neurite outgrowth in primary neurons , overexpression experiments were per-formed on both PDL and myelin . Overexpression was carried out in cultured CGN via electroporation and neurite outgrowth was measured at 24 h . A significant difference in outgrowth was observed when CBP p300 , P CAF or the acetylation mimic p53 K-Q K320-72-3-82 Q-lysine to glutamine were overexpressed on either PDL or myelin Figure 8 . This shows that both on permissive substrates such as PDL and on myelin , their overexpression promotes a significant enhance-ment in outgrowth to levels comparable to the effects of TSA . In summary , we have shown here that CBP p300 as well as P CAF and their related acetylation-dependent p53 signalling 53 KD 17 KD 43 KD * GAP-43 GAP-43 +1 +1 40 neurite ? m are key events in allowing physiological pro-outgrowth signals in primary neurons , and in driving outgrowth on inhibitory substrates , thereby transducing the hyperacetylation-depen-dent pro-outgrowth cascade on both permissive and non-permissive substrates Figure 9 , a diagram illustrating the molecular pathway elucidated here . Our work shows for the first time that pharmacological hyperacetylation mediated by HDAC I and II inhibition promotes neuronal outgrowth on both permissive and inhibitory substrates through induction of gene expression via histone H3 K9-14 acetylation on the promoters of CBP p300 and P CAF , which in turn promote neuronal outgrowth and mediate H3 K9-14 as well as p53 acetylation . These modifications lead to chromatin remodelling and enhanced p53-dependent promoter accessibility that drive the expression of specific pro-neuronal outgrowth genes . Recent experiments in primary neurons showed that specific nitrosylation of HDAC2 increases acetylation of histones surrounding neurotrophin-dependent gene promo-ters and stimulate transcription . Inhibition of HDAC2 expres-sion also facilitated dendritic growth and branching in embryonic cortical neurons.24 This supports our findings that inhibition of HDACs promotes neuronal outgrowth . However , currently no studies have implicated CBP , p300 and the closely related P CAF in neuronal outgrowth on permissive or inhibitory substrates . Here , we have shown that these HATs are required for physiological neuronal outgrowth and for the pro-outgrowth TSA-hyperacetylation-dependent signal transduction . Specifically , TSA promotes not only histone H3 K9-14 acetylation , but also stimulates CBP , p300 and P CAF gene expression by hyperacetylating their promoters , thereby facilitating transcription . This suggests the presence of a positive feedback loop initiated by the relative increase in acetyltransferase activity through inhibi-tion of HDACs . This leads to histone hyperacetylation and activation of the CBP , p300 and P CAF promoters , enhance-ment of gene expression further fueling this hyperacetylation loop . Given the shift in balance , the unchecked CBP , p300 and P CAF acetylate p53 , which is essential to transduce the hyperacetylation-dependent pro-neuronal outgrowth program Figure 9 . In fact , the expression of specific p53-dependent genes , including GAP-43 and Coronin 1b , is triggered by hyperacetylation through increased occupancy of their pro-moters by acetylated p53 . This may be facilitated by the presence of histone acetylation on their promoters that enhances the DNA accessibility of p53 and of its trans-criptional co-factors . Our data also suggest that hyperacetylation stimulates this pro-growth program independent of the plated substrate , for it also promotes growth cone remodelling and inhibits growth cone collapse in neurons when plated on inhibitory substrates myelin and CSPGs . Importantly , overexpression of CBP p300 , P CAF and of an acetylation mutant of p53 that mimics CBP p300 and P CAF acetylation on its C-terminus promotes neurite outgrowth on permissive substrates and is able to overcome myelin inhibition . Acetylation of p53 mediated by CBP , p300 and P CAF on its C-terminus re-directs p53 towards specific promoters and cellular effects.25 Here , we show that the CBP p300 and P CAF-dependent acetylation of p53 is required for neuronal outgrowth and largely mediates the pro-outgrowth properties of TSA-induced hyperacetylation . Currently , we can not exclude that other TFs that have been already shown to be acetylated and to be involved in neuronal survival or outgrowth , such as CREB and NFkB , 15,17,26,27 might also participate in the TSA-mediated enhancement of neuronal outgrowth . As far as the potential downstream targets are concerned , overexpression of GAP-43 and Coronin 1b might at least partially overcome myelin-dependent growth cone collapse by several potential mechanisms . GAP-43 is a phospho-membrane bound glycoprotein , whose expression is often correlated with axonal outgrowth and regeneration in the peripheral nervous system , in the dorsal root ganglia , in the facial nerve nuclei , in the optic nerve and in the descending serotoninergic fibres in the spinal cord . It has also been shown to be associated with the overcoming of myelin and proteoglycan-dependent inhibitory signalling of axon outgrowth in the optic nerve after pro-regeneration stimuli.28�31 In addition , cerebellar Purkinje cells that over-express GAP-43 are able to sprout their axons into white matter and show a pronounced tendency to lose myelin.32 Coronin 1b an actin-binding protein was previously shown by us to promote neurite outgrowth in primary neurons.33 A recent work suggested that Coronin 1b can dephosphorylate cofilin during actin filament and cytoskeleton remodelling at the leading edge of lamellipodia.34 Phosphorylation of cofilin by ROCK and LIMK is a critical step in growth cone collapse mediated by inhibitory substrates , therefore the dephosphor-ylation activity of Coronin 1b on cofilin may contribute to the inhibition of growth cone collapse . In addition to GAP-43 and Coronin 1b , the expression level of a set of putative p53-dependent pro-neurite outgrowth genes was also enhanced by TSA . This suggests the multiplicity of the p53 pathway during hyperacetylation on the activation of several pro-outgrowth factors . Future challenges include the discovery of the fine regulation of the TSA-dependent effects on neuronal out-growth . For example , it would be interesting to combine the administration of TSA with other compounds such as neurotrophins , including nerve growth factor , retinoic acid , brain-derived neurotrophic factor or cAMP analogues that might enhance TSA pro-neuronal outgrowth effects . Also , non-transcriptional-dependent effects of HDAC inhibitors could be investigated . In summary , we believe that our work provides solid evidence for a positive function of HDAC inhibition and CBP p300 and P CAF acetylation-dependent transcriptional pathways in neuronal outgrowth . Further studies are warranted to elucidate additional acetylation-dependent transcriptional targets that may promote outgrowth in vitro , and to investigate whether hyperacetylation may trigger a pro-axonal regenerative genetic program in adult neurons after axonal lesions in vivo .

Briefly , 8 107 CGN were grown in the absence or presence of TSA 1 ng ml for 24 h and subsequently fixed in a 1 % formaldehyde solution for 10 min at 37 1C . Following cell lysis 0.5 % SDS , 100 mM NaCl , 50 mM Tris HCl , ph 8.0 , 5 mM EDTA , extracts were sonicated to shear DNA to lengths of 200�600 bp . Chromatin solutions were incubated overnight with rotation using 4 mg of rabbit polyclonal anti-Acetyl histone H3 antibody Upstate , anti-p53 acetyl-lysine K373 2 Upstate or rabbit anti-p53 acetyl-lysine K320 Upstate .

For real-time quantitation of PCR products and fold change measurements after ChIP , each experimental sample was normalized to Input and Mock fractions before undergoing the standardized fold change calculation performed following the manufacture�s instructions Invitrogen . Only real-time expression profiles that showed reproducible triplicate measurements were included in the analysis . In addition , samples included in the analysis had corresponding Mock fractions that displayed CT values close to background . Immunoblotting . For immunoblotting , cultured CGN were collected at different time point 4 , 8 and 24 h and lysed as described above for tissue extraction . A portion of the lysate 30�50 mg of protein was then fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis , and the separated proteins were transferred to a PVDF membrane . After the transfer of samples , the membrane was then probed with rabbit anti-acetylated-H3 K9 , K14 , Upstate , rabbit anti-p53 acetyl-lysine K373 2 Upstate , rabbit anti-p53 acetyl-lysine K320 Upstate , rabbit anti-p53 FL Santa-Cruz rabbit anti-GAP-43 Chemicon , schwalbach , Germany and rabbit anti-Coronin 1b custom antibody from Bethyl Laboratories , Montgomery , TX , USA . Mouse anti-b-actin Sigma was used as control for gel loading and transfer . Immune complexes were detected with appropriate secondary antibodies goat anti-rabbit IgG , goat anti-mouse IgG , label with horseradish peroxidase , Thermo Scientific , Bonn , Germany and chemiluminescence reagents Pierce ECL Western blotting Substrate . Quantitation of protein expression was performed by densitometry of the representative bands of the immunoblots and normalized to the respective levels of b-actin . Adult primary neurons from the cortex or the cerebellum were also prepared as mentioned before for RCN or CGN cultures , respectively . After dissociation , cells were immediately collected by centrifugation and homogenized for immunoblotting as described . This procedure results into an enriched neuronal population at the time of blotting . Neuronal process outgrowth measurements . Immunofluorescence was detected using a Zeiss Microscope Axiovert 200 , Zeiss Inc. , Esslingen , Germany and pictures were taken at a 20 and 100 oil immersion magnification Zeiss at room temperature using a CDD camera Axiocam MRm , Zeiss . Neurite analysis and measurements were performed using the Neurolucida software MicroBrightField , Colchester , VT , USA . For each experimental condition and three replicates in triplicate experiments were analysed . Between 80 and 100 cells per replicate were counted for specific numbers , please see figure legend . Neurite outgrowth was evaluated by calculating the number of processes per 100 cells and the average process length per cell . A growth cone was defined collapsed when the diameter was not bigger than the diameter of the neuronal process . The area of the non-collapsed growth cones was measured on an average of 100 growth cones for each triplicate . Measurements were taken from three individual experiments by two different operators . Statistical analysis was performed on these three individual experiments by using a two-tailed unpaired t-test . Densitometry analysis . To correlate histone acetylation and neurite outgrowth , we used densitometric analysis of the immunofluorescent signal AlphaEaseFC software . First , we calculated the mean intensity for AcH3 K9-14 in control vehicle and TSA 1 ng ml -treated CGN cells 50 cells per experiments were counted , in triplicate . Each mean intensity was then used as a threshold to determine cells with a high or low intensity of AcH3 K9-14 immunosignal after TSA . Cells with a signal equal or superior to AcH3 K9-14 mean intensity of TSA-treated cells were considered as high intensity cells . On the contrary , cells with a densitometry value equal or inferior to AcH3 K9-14 mean intensity of control were considered as low intensity cells . Cells showing pyknotic nuclei were not included in the study . Neurites outgrowth was then quantified in these two classes of cells and compared as described above . Statistical analysis was performed on these three individual experiments by using a two-tailed unpaired t-test . Acknowledgements .

20150915	An essential function for the NEDD1 in zebrafish JA Manning1,2 , M Lewis3 , SA Koblar3 and S Kumar* , 1,2 The centrosome is the major microtubule organising centre MTOC of cells and serves as a centralised location for controlling many cellular processes . The centrosomal protein neural precursor cell expressed developmentally down-regulated gene 1 NEDD1 , 1 functions in the centrosomal and mitotic-spindle recruitment of the g-tubulin ring complex g-TuRC . This complex is required for the nucleation of microtubules , correct formation of the mitotic spindle and hence progression of the cell cycle.2,3 Because of this , depletion of NEDD1 from mammalian cells results in dispe-rsion of the MTOC , impaired centrosomal and chromatin nucleation of microtubules , mitotic chaos and cell-cycle arrest.2�4 Given the centrosomal localisation and function of NEDD1 , and its dynamic expression during mouse embryogenesis , 5 it is expected that this protein has an important role during development . However , because of the early embryonic lethality of mouse knockouts of centrosomal proteins , includ-ing g-tubulin , it has not been possible to study the function of these proteins in later stages of development in this organism.6,7 Zebrafish Danio rerio posses many benefits for developmental studies including the conservation of genes involved in cell growth and proliferation , 8 the rapid maturation of translucent embryos9 and the ability to specifically deplete proteins of interest.10 Although there has been much work analysing the cell cycle in zebrafish , 11 there has been limited centrosomal protein analysis of the centrosome in this species . Therefore , this system was chosen as a model to study the role of NEDD1 during development . In addition , NEDD1 homologues have been described in Drosophila , Xenopus and Arabidopsis.12�14 Despite the consistent centrosomal localisation of NEDD1 in these species , its effect on g-tubulin recruitment appears to be species dependant . Hence , this study also aimed to compare the function of zebrafish NEDD1 zNEDD1 to other homo-logues . In this paper we report on the characterisation of zNEDD1 and provide evidence that this protein displays a similar localisation and function to mammalian NEDD1 . In addition , we demonstrate that zNEDD1 is essential in zebrafish and its depletion leads to defects in mitosis , apoptosis and develop-ment , focusing on the brain of NEDD1 morphant embryos . Results Cloning of zNEDD1 . A zebrafish homologue of NEDD1 was identified by a BLAST search using the human NEDD1 protein sequence . This revealed a previously uncharacterised zebrafish protein of 676 amino acids accession number NP_998671 , that is 44 % identical and 60 % similar to human NEDD1 Supplementary Figure S1a . The 79 residues at the C-terminus of these proteins are 68 % identical and 99 % similar , suggesting functional conservation and further indicating that this protein is the zebrafish homologue of NEDD1 . As in human NEDD1 , which has seven WD40 motifs in the N-terminal half of the protein , zNEDD1 also contains seven WD40 motifs lying within a similar region of the protein Supplementary Figure S1b . These motifs are normally involved in protein�protein interactions.15 A phylogenetic analysis of this protein with known NEDD1 homologues from other species shows that Danio rerio NEDD1 shares a common ancestor with multiple 1 cell 8 cell high germ ring bud 18 somite neural tube 18 somite 24 hpf species , and is closest to Xenopus laevis in evolutionary distance Supplementary Figure S1c . zNEDD1 expression is high in the nervous system and downregulated in development . In situ hybridisation analysis showed that in early embryogenesis zNEDD1 mRNA was distributed uniformly throughout all developing tissues Figure 1a . This expression was increased during the 75 % epiboly and bud stages of the embryo , before cell decreasing again as the embryo progressed through development . By 72 h post fertilisation hpf there was a marked reduction in zNEDD1 expression . Upon analysis of higher magnification dorsal views of embryos at the 18 somite and 24 hpf stages , it was apparent that zNEDD1 expression was highest in neural tissues Figure 1b . This was most evident in the neural tube at the 18 somite stage , and also in the retina and the lens of the eye at 24 hfp . This widespread expression within the developing nervous system correlates with the highest concentration of proliferating cells within the embryos at these develop-mental stages.16 In order to analyse zNEDD1 protein levels , an antibody against the C-terminal 252 amino acids of zNEDD1 was generated Supplementary Figure S2 . This antibody was not suitable for whole-mount staining , and hence the developmental expression of zNEDD1 protein was assessed by immunoblotting . There was a high level of maternal zNEDD1 evident until the midblastula transition Figure 1c , first three lanes .17,18 Consistent with the in situ data , the zygotic level of zNEDD1 remained high early in development and was then downregulated from about the 75 % epiboly stage Figure 1c and Supplementary Figure S3 . From the 18 somite stage it was barely detectable by immunoblotting , which is consistent with restricted in situ expression . As expected , g-tubulin levels remained constant during the time course , given that it has shown to be expressed at similar levels during all the stages of development.19 As a loading control , b-actin maternal expression was low , but was upregulated from the time of zygotic expression high stage and remained fairly constant during development . 598-676 615-676 -control 1-676 1-597 1-614 zNEDD1 localises to the centrosome and interacts with c-tubulin . When transfected into mammalian cells , zNEDD1 localised primarily to the centrosomes Figure 2a , lower cell transfected only , where there was complete colocalisation with g-tubulin . A small amount was also present in the cytoplasm , which is presumably due to overexpression of the protein . To examine the interaction of zNEDD1 with g-tubulin , zNEDD1 was immunoprecipitated from transfected cells and blotted for g-tubulin . A clear interaction between zNEDD1 and g-tubulin was evident Figure 2b . An alignment of the mammalian and zebrafish proteins reveals that the C-terminal region residues 572�660 of human NEDD1 initially found to interact with g-tubulin , 3 shows a high degree of homology with residues 598�676 of zNEDD1 Supplementary Figure S1a . In addition , a smaller region of zNEDD1 comprising 615�676 aa is 70 % identical and 98 % similar to human NEDD1 . Upon immunoprecipitation of zNEDD1 , g-tubulin was found to interact with full-length zNEDD1 1�676 aa , and constructs containing amino acids 598�676 or 615�676 Figure 2c . No g-tubulin was immunoprecipitated by other constructs lacking the C-terminus of zNEDD1 residues 1�597 and 1�614 . Thus , residues 615�676 of zNEDD1 are sufficient for its interaction with g-tubulin . zNEDD1 depletion in embryos leads to deformed embryos and brain disorganisation . To determine the function of zNEDD1 during development , the effect of reducing zNEDD1 protein in early embryogenesis was examined . Two morpholinos MOs were designed to block the translation of zNEDD1 Supplementary Figure S4a . Embryos injected with a high dose 1 mM of zNEDD1 MOs did not survive to 24 hpf , so lower doses of MO were injected . When 0.25 mM of MO1 or MO2 alone was injected into embryos , there was B50 % reduction in zNEDD1 protein levels Supplementary Figure S4b and c . When the two MOs were coinjected 0.125 mM each , there was B80 % depletion of zNEDD1 protein . The levels of both g-tubulin and b-actin were unchanged . When compared with control-injected embryos , those injected with an intermediate dose of zNEDD1 MO1 ? 2 0.25 mM total mostly survived to 24 hpf , but appeared unhealthy with an apparent accumulation of cell death Figure 3 . In the brain , there was obvious disorganisation of normal patterning and size such that the overall structure of the heads was smaller . Hence , this concentration of MO was chosen for further analysis . At 24 hpf , the uninjected and control-injected embryos developed normally and many clearly defined structures of the brain such as the ventricles tectal and fourth ventricle labelled and the cerebellum could be observed Figure 3a and b . The forebrain , the midbrain and the hindbrain could also be identified and their boundaries easily distinguished . In addition , the eyes were easily delineated . All zNEDD1-depleted embryos displayed abnorm-alities , but there was some variability in the extent of these defects , presumably depending on the efficiency of knock-down Figure 3c�e . It was possible to arbitrarily categorise the zNEDD1 morphants into mild , moderate and severely abnormal phenotypes , with the majority of zNEDD1-depleted fish displaying moderate levels of abnormalities . When compared with uninjected and control injected , all zNEDD1-depleted embryos displayed abnormal shortened tails with a curved body axis however , defects in the nervous system were analysed further in this study Figure 3c�e . In cases of mild abnormalities , the eyes remained largely intact , and the midbrain and the hindbrain were present and well defined Figure 3c . However , the forebrain was not properly devel-oped . This phenotype was more obvious in cases of moderate abnormalities , with the forebrain appearing severely disorga-nised and containing aggregates of dark masses , presumably representing dead cells Figure 3d . The ventricular system was also abnormal in size and shape , although the midbrain and the hindbrain structures were still defined , and eyes were present . In zNEDD1-depleted embryos classed as being severely abnormal , the eyes were completely obliterated Figure 3e . There were more dark masses , and the midbrain , the hindbrain and the forebrain structures could not be delineated . These results indicate that the knockdown of NEDD1 leads to abnormalities including in patterning and organisation of the zebrafish brain . Phenotypes of zNEDD1-depleted embryos can be rescued by zNEDD1 mRNA . In order to verify that the observed phenotypes were because of specific zNEDD1 knockdown and not off-targets effects , the combined MOs were injected into embryos together with capped full-length zNEDD1 mRNA . It is important to note that co-injection with zNEDD1 mRNA largely rescued the phenotypes , such that these embryos appeared similar to uninjected embryos Figure 3f . When compared with uninjected embryos , embryos injected with zNEDD1 MO1 ? 2 displayed obvious phenotypic abnormalities with only B30 % appearing normal Figure 3g . However , upon co-injection of zNEDD1 MO1 ? 2 with zNEDD1 mRNA , B80 % of embryos appeared morphologically normal . The rescue of morphology was shown to be because of the significant restoration of zNEDD1 protein levels by the co-injection Figure 3h . These results confirm that the reduction in zNEDD1 caused by MO injection is specifically responsible for the observed phenotypic abnormalities . zNEDD1-depleted embryos display a high level of apoptosis . The dark cell masses apparent in the phenotypic analysis of zNEDD1-depleted embryos suggested that these morphants displayed a high level of cell death . To investigate this further , embryos were assessed for apoptosis by TUNEL . Although uninjected and control-injected embryos exhibited very few apoptotic cells 18�4 and 18�7 TUNEL positive cells per embryo respectively , Figure 4a , b and f , zNEDD1-depleted embryos consistently displayed a higher level of apoptosis present throughout the whole embryo 64�12 TUNEL positive cells per embryo , but more concentrated in the brain and the neural tube Figure 4c0 , c00 and f . In particular , there were a high number of apoptotic cells in the forebrain , correlating with the gross morphological abnormalities and cell death seen in this region of the brain in Figure 3 . Co-injection with zNEDD1 mRNA rescued this phenotype 18�7 TUNEL positive cells per embryo , Figure 4d and f , thus indicating that the apoptosis is caused by the specific reduction of zNEDD1 . It is known that some MOs nonspecifically induce p53 activity , which may result in increased cell death.20 In order to discount this as the cause for the apoptosis seen when injecting with zNEDD1 MOs , co-injections were carried out with a previously characterised p53 MO.20,21 After co-injection of zNEDD1 MOs with the p53 MO , apoptosis was still occurring , although the number of TUNEL-positive cells appeared to be slightly lower in the co-injected embryos 56�5 TUNEL-positive cells per embryo , Figure 4e and f and Supplementary Figure S5 . As this phenotype was rescued by co-injection with zNEDD1 mRNA , this suggests that some of the apoptosis in embryos depleted of zNEDD1 by MO injection relies on p53 activity . zNEDD1-depleted embryos display mitotic arrest . Given that the depletion of NEDD1 in cultured mammalian cells has been shown to cause mitotic arrest , 2,3 we examined whether there were any changes in the mitotic index of zNEDD1-depleted zebrafish embryos by staining for phosphorylated histone H3 pH3 , which is present during G2 and mitosis.22 zNEDD1-depleted embryos displayed an increase in the number of mitotic cells when compared with uninjected or control-injected embryos 75�12 pH3-positive cells per embryo for uninjected , 71�14 for control and 150�42 for zNEDD1-depleted , Figure 5a�c and e . As there did not appear to be an increase in total cell numbers or size of the embryos , this suggests that many cells may have been arrested in mitosis . The mitotic cells were present throughout the embryo , but appeared concentrated in the brain and neural tube . Co-injection with zNEDD1 mRNA partially rescued this phenotype , although unlike other phenotypes this was not completely restored , 114�16 pH3 positive cells per embryo , Figure 5d and e . This may be explained by the incomplete restoration of zNEDD1 protein levels following zNEDD1 mRNA injection , which may have been insufficient to avert the arrest of some cells in mitosis . e mb e hb e e e Overexpression of residues 598�676 of zNEDD1 mimics the apoptosis and mitotic arrest of zNEDD1 depletion . We have recently observed that the C-terminal region of mammalian NEDD1 acts as a dominant-negative by binding to endogenous g-tubulin and sequestering it away from the centrosome JAM and SK , unpublished data . As a similar region of zNEDD1 is sufficient for binding to g-tubulin Figure 2c , we tested whether overexpression of residues 598�676 of zNEDD1 could cause effects similar to those seen by zNEDD1 depletion . It is interesting to note that 76 % of embryos injected with GFP-tagged zNEDD1 598�676 mRNA were dead or severely abnormal by 24 hpf , compared with only 20 % of embryos injected with GFP mRNA suggesting that overexpression of GFP�zNEDD1 598�676 is toxic to the embryos . However , in surviving embryos , those with detectable GFP�zNEDD1 expression , but not GFP control , were phenotypically deformed , similar to the embryos injected with zNEDD1 MO in Figure 3 Supplementary Figure S6a . In addition , these embryos displayed a higher level of TUNEL and pH3 staining indicative of increased apoptosis and mitotic arrest , although this was not quantitated given the severity of abnormalities and low number of surviving embryos Supplementary Figure S6b and c . This suggests that residues 598�676 of zNEDD1 act as a dominant negative to disrupt normal zNEDD1 function and provides further evidence that zNEDD1 is important for zebrafish development . zNEDD1-depleted embryos undergo neurogenesis , but present poorly patterned neuronal structures . Given the mitotic arrest and increased apoptosis in zNEDD1-depleted embryos , it was no surprise that these embryos displayed other morphological abnormalities . Also , consistent with the expression of zNEDD1 mRNA in neural tissues Figure 1b , the disorganised appearance of brains in the zNEDD1 morphants Figure 3 was anticipated and further suggested that these embryos may exhibit neuronal defects . To characterise this further , embryos at 24 hpf were stained with an antibody to HuC , a protein that maintains high expression in post-mitotic cells in most regions of the nervous system.23 All embryos were developmentally age matched , as can be seen by the normal development of structures such as the eyes in most cases Figure 6 . In uninjected , control injected and zNEDD1 MO1 ? 2 ? RNA co-injected embryos , HuC was expressed in multiple regions of the brain and in a continuous population of post-mitotic neurons throughout the rostrocaudal axis of the neural tube Figure 6a , b and d , arrows .24,25 These neurons were still present in zNEDD1-depleted embryos , even though the embryos had growth defects and abnormalities at this stage Figure 6c . Upon closer analysis of the staining in the trunk of these embryos , the HuC-positive neurons consistently appeared similar in number and patterning to uninjected , control and rescued embryos Figure 6e�h . However , in regions of the brain , the hindbrain and the cranial ganglia , there were variable effects of zNEDD1 depletion on neuronal number and patterning , with the majority of embryos displaying a moderate phenotype . In a dorsal view of embryos at 24 hpf , HuC is normally distributed throughout regions of the forebrain , the hindbrain and in the cranial ganglia , as seen in uninjected , control and rescued embryos Figure 6i , j and l . After zNEDD1 depletion , embryos that displayed moderate abnormalities still contained many HuC-positive neurons , although there was distorted patterning of brain structures and cranial ganglia Figure 6k0 . In addition , the brain structures were reduced in size , which is consistent with the increase in cell death and mitotic arrest described previously in the brain Figure 4 . In embryos that displayed severe morphological defects , HuC-positive neurons were still present , but the severity of the brain , the hindbrain and the cranial ganglia disruption to size , neuronal number and patterning was more intense Figure 6k00 . Hence , zNEDD1 depletion from zebrafish embryos does not appear to affect the differentiation of post-mitotic neurons , but does cause severe defects in neuronal organisation in the brain . To further characterise the effects of zNEDD1 depletion on neural development , embryos were also analysed for Rohon� Beard RB sensory neurons.26 In uninjected and control-injected embryos , characteristic acetylated a-tubulin staining revealed RB cells and their axonal projections along the tracts of the dorsal longitudinal fasciculus Figure 6m and n .27 In zNEDD1-depleted embryos , there was variability in the extent of abnormalities seen . Embryos with mild and moderate phenotypes displayed a relatively normal morphology of the neural tube , but had greatly reduced acetylated a-tubulin staining , with a decrease in RB cells and a marked reduction in the fasciculation of their axons Figure 6o0 . Severely abnormal zNEDD1 morphants displayed scarce RB cells , residing in the proximal region only . Axons were disorganised and displayed markedly reduced fasciculation , probably due 80 cells 50 positive 40 30 TUNEL 20 No. 10 0 uninjected control 1+2 1+2+RNA 1+2+p53 Morpholino RNA injected to the reduction in neurons present in these embryos Figure 6o00 . It was also easily observed in the acetylated a-tubulin stained embryos that the neural tube was severely abnormal , suggesting spina bifida incomplete closure of the neural tube was occurring . As seen for other phenotypes , co-injection with zNEDD1 mRNA rescued the defects Figure 6p . Thus , as well as disrupting post-mitotic HuC neurons , the depletion of zNEDD1 also caused abnormalities in the number and patterning of RB sensory neurons , their axonal outgrowth and fasciculation , and neural tube formation . Depletion of zNEDD1 causes a loss of c-tubulin from the centrosome . In mammalian cells , the most important function of NEDD1 identified thus far is its role in recruiting g-tubulin to the centrosome , 2,3 although this does not seem to be true in Drosophila and Xenopus.13,28 It was hypothesised that the inability of g-tubulin to localise to the centrosome in zNEDD1-depleted embryos may contribute to the phenotypic abnormalities observed in this study . Therefore , we assessed whether zNEDD1 is important in the recruitment of g�tubulin to the centrosome in zebrafish . At 24 hpf , in all cells of control-injected embryos , zNEDD1 and g-tubulin perfectly co-localised in centrosomes . This was most obvious in regions of high proliferation such as in the hindbrain . The centrosomes were intensely stained with zNEDD1 and g-tubulin at the apical surface in these cells Figure 7a , section through the fourth ventricle shown . In zNEDD1-depleted embryos , there was a dramatic reduction in the levels of expression of centrosomal zNEDD1 and g-tubulin in the same region and the ventricles were less well formed Figure 7b . Similar observations were made in the forebrain Figure 7c and d . Thus , similar to mammalian NEDD1 , zNEDD1 appears to be required for the recruitment of g-tubulin to centrosomes . Therefore , it seems likely that the centrosomal reduction of g-tubulin in zNEDD1-depleted embryos contributes to the observed morphological abnormalities . Discussion This study describes the identification and characterisation of a zebrafish homologue of NEDD1 , which displays highly conserved regions of sequence similarity to mammalian NEDD1 . The analysis of mRNA and protein revealed that zNEDD1 is highly expressed early in embryonic stages , particularly in neural regions , and is downregulated as embryogenesis proceeds . This observation is consistent with initial observations that NEDD1 is downregulated in the brain during mouse embryonic development.5 The high expression of zNEDD1 correlates with the time of the most rapid proliferation occurring in the embryo.16 This aligns well with the expression of mammalian NEDD1,5 and suggests that zNEDD1 may be important in early development , particularly in the nervous system at times of rapid proliferation . It is important to note that zNEDD1 appears to function in a manner similar to homologues identified in mammals , 2,3 Drosophila12,28 and Xenopus13 by localising to the centro-some and interacting with g-tubulin . However , unlike the dynamic expression of zNEDD1 , the level of g-tubulin remains constant during embryogenesis , suggesting that there may be additional g-tubulin-independent functions of zNEDD1 . It is plausible that this protein is important in other cellular processes besides its established role in microtubule organisation . Depletion of zNEDD1 resulted in embryos displaying variable phenotypes , with all exhibiting developmental and cellular abnormalities , including smaller heads , disorganised brains , evidence of spina bifida and an increase in apoptotic and mitotic cells . Defects in post-mitotic and sensory neurons were also observed , suggesting that zNEDD1 may regulate the proliferation , organisation and migration of neurons , which are processes that are known to involve the centrosome.29,30 The highest level of abnormalities was seen in the forebrain , but the reasons for this are at present unknown . It is important to note that the observed phenotypes were the result of specific zNEDD1 depletion , as co-injection of the MOs with zNEDD1 mRNA , which restored zNEDD1 protein levels , was able to rescue the phenotypes . In addition , overexpression of a GFP-tagged C-terminal region of zNEDD1 caused similar effects as zNEDD1 depletion although it was more toxic to the embryos . The equivalent region of mammalian NEDD1 acts as a dominant negative by binding to g-tubulin and sequeste-ring it away from the centrosome JAM and SK , unpublished data . Therefore , overexpression of this region of zNEDD1 in zebrafish is likely to function by interfering with the function of endogenous zNEDD1 protein . These loss-of-function studies 120 80 40 clearly indicate that zNEDD1 is critical for the development and the proper formation of the brain . Correlating with the morphological abnormalities , it was found that zNEDD1-depleted embryos displayed a high level of apoptosis . It is important to note that this occurred primarily in the brain and the neural tube , which are regions of high zNEDD1 expression . It is interesting to note that although this apoptosis still occurred after co-depletion of p53 , which is often upregulated after MO injection , there was a slight reduction in the amount of apoptotic cells in these embryos . As many proteins induce apoptosis by stabilising or upregu-lating p53,31 it is feasible that zNEDD1 depletion may exert some of its effects through the p53 pathway . In addition to cell death , consistent with the depletion of NEDD1 in mammals resulting in an increased mitotic index , 2,3 zebrafish embryos with reduced zNEDD1 had a higher incidence of pH3 staining , indicative of mitotic arrest . Given that the increase in mitotic cells and the observed apoptosis were occurring in similar regions of the embryo , it is likely that the apoptosis was a downstream consequence of the mitotic arrest . By inhibiting cell proliferation , it has been demon-strated that the amount of proliferation occurring in the midbrain and the hindbrain neural tube surrounding the ventricles correlates with future ventricle size.32 Hence , it is plausible that the zNEDD1-depleted cells in this study may be arresting in mitosis and then undergoing apoptosis , therefore not allowing cell proliferation and thus resulting in smaller brain ventricular structures . It is interesting to note that these phenotypes resemble the zebrafish cassiopeia mutant , which displays an increased mitotic index and increased numbers of apoptotic cells.33 The cassiopeia mutant harbours a loss-of-function of the SCL-interrupting locus SIL gene , 34 which is normally expressed specifically in mitosis.35 Embryos depleted of SIL have extremely disorganised mitotic spindles and often lack one mb mb hb cranial ganglia Control MO RB cell MO1+2 RB cell or both centrosomes.33 Hence , it has been hypothesised that SIL may be required for proper centrosome duplication or for microtubule organisation , as its disruption leads to centro-some dissociation from the mitotic spindle . Therefore , given that the phenotypes observed in embryos depleted of zNEDD1 resemble those of SIL depletion , they are likely to be because , at least in part , of its centrosomal function and in organising a correct mitotic spindle . There have been limited studies assessing the role of the centrosome in zebrafish development . However , it is apparent that depletion of the other zebrafish centrosomal proteins analysed thus far can also cause defects in the nervous system . Indeed , it has been demonstrated that depletion of the centrosomal protein CEP290 nephrocystin-6 from zebrafish embryos results in developmental defects of the CNS such as smaller eyes and defects of the brain , 36 thereby highlighting the importance of centrosomal proteins in CNS development . In addition , depletion of CEP290 causes retinal degeneration and kidney abnormalities , because of its function in cilia.36,37 Depletion of other centrosomal proteins , Cep70 and Cep131 , also results in embryos with a curved tail , shortened body axis and ectopic otoliths , because of shortened cilia.38 Although not examined here , given the link between centrosomal proteins and ciliary function , and the localisation of NEDD1 to the base of cilia in mouse embryos , 5 it is feasible that zNEDD1 depletion also causes ciliary defects in zebrafish . As discussed previously , mammalian NEDD1 is essential for the recruitment of g-tubulin to the centrosome , where it nucleates microtubules and allows correct mitotic progres-sion . Homologues in Drosophila and Xenopus are not required for this centrosomal g-tubulin recruitment.12,13,28 It is interesting to note that this study has revealed that the depletion of zNEDD1 from zebrafish also causes a reduction in g-tubulin at the centrosome . Hence , zNEDD1 functions to recruit g-tubulin to the centrosome in zebrafish , and this is presumably important for correct mitotic progression and embryonic development . It is interesting that zebrafish NEDD1 functions more similarly to mammalian NEDD1 than to the Xenopus homologue , XNEDD1 . However , it is possible that the apparent difference in recruitment of g-tubulin is due more to the experimental systems , than because of true functional differences . In conclusion , our study clearly indicates that zNEDD1 interacts with g-tubulin and localises to the centrosome as in other species . We have shown that zNEDD1 is critical for the recruitment of g-tubulin to the centrosome , as in mammalian cells , and is essential for the proper development of zebrafish .

20203688	CF Cheok1 , N Kua1 , P Kaldis2 and DP Lane* , 1 Mutations in p53 occur in 50 % of all human tumors , and in many of the remaining tumors , p53 pathways are inactivated either due to the amplification of murine double minute 2 MDM2 , its negative regulator , or loss of expression of alternate open reading frame ARF .1�3 Targeting p53 mutant tumors with chemotherapeutics selective for dividing cells e.g. , mitotic inhibitors , vinblastine , paclitaxel and S-phase inhibitors has met with varying successes , partly due to normal tissue toxicities . A characteristic of cells carrying loss-of-function mutations in the p53 gene is the loss of the G1 restriction checkpoint . It is possible that temporary reversible activation of G1 checkpoint in normal cells using specific agents can protect them from the effects of some mitotic inhibitors.4,5 Cancer cells lacking normal checkpoint regula-tion continue to divide in the presence of mitotic drugs , resulting in mitotic catastrophe and cell death . Recent studies demonstrated that nutlin , a small molecule antagonist of MDM2 functions , induced a p53-dependent checkpoint arrest and protected some cells from toxicity of the mitotic and S-phase inhibitors.6,7 Nutlin-3 disrupts the MDM2�p53 inter-action , resulting in the activation and accumulation of p53 in cells expressing wild-type p53.8 The crucial roles of aurora kinases in cell cycle regulation coupled with evidence of overexpression of aurora A and B kinases in a wide variety of tumors has led to the development of pharmacological inhibitors of aurora kinases.9,10 A new generation of aurora inhibitors , including VX-680 , have been evaluated preclinically and are in phase I and II trials for the treatment of solid tumors and leukemia.9 VX-680 inhibits aurora A and B kinases with low nanomolar potency11 and the cellular effects are consistent with the inhibition of both aurora A and B kinases , that is , monospindle phenotype , disruption of spindle assembly checkpoint SAC , aberrant chromosomal segregation , endoreduplication and cytokinesis failure.12,13 Endoreduplication , the re-replication of DNA in the absence of mitotic division , ultimately results in polyploidy and cell death . It is thought that a p53-dependent postmitotic checkpoint prevents polyploidy.13 It is however unclear whether wild-type p53 suppresses polyploidy in cells exposed to aurora kinase inhibitors and , importantly , whether normal cells are also susceptible to these drug effects . The aims of this study were to determine whether 1 normal cells and cells expressing wild-type p53 are susceptible to VX-680-induced endoreduplication and apoptosis , and whether 2 the combination of a potent and selective antagonist of MDM2 , nutlin-3 and VX-680 could protect wild-type p53-expressing cells from endoreduplication and apoptosis while killing p53 mutant cells selectively . In addition , we found that loss of p53 led to increased polyploidy and that abrogating p73 functions compromises the apoptotic response and increases polyploidy in cells exposed to VX-680 . Both p53 and p73 have distinct and cooperative roles in mediating cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in response to aurora kinase inhibition . Collectively , our study has important implications for the use of aurora kinase inhibitors and MDM2 antagonists in the clinic . Results Aurora kinase inhibition induces extensive endoreduplication in both p53 wild-type and p53 - deficient cell lines . p53 has been implicated in a postmitotic G1 checkpoint in response to various mitotic inhibitors . We examined whether this checkpoint is induced after aurora kinase inhibition by VX-680 and whether tetraploidy is suppressed by wild-type p53 functions . Using a panel of commonly used tumor-derived cell lines expressing either wild-type p53 , mutant p53 or a deletion at the p53 gene locus Table 1 , we tested the correlation of p53 gene status to VX-680-induced endoreduplication . These cell lines were treated with VX-680 , and harvested for cell cycle analysis at 24 , 48 and 72 h . To our surprise , all tumor cell lines undergo endoreduplication . Despite the presence of wild-type p53 in A375 , A549 , U2OS and HCT116 , endoreduplication occurs but to a variable extent , giving rise to cells with 8N , and , in some cases , 16N and 32N DNA content Figure 1 . p53 was activated in cells treated with VX-680 , and p53 target genes , p21 , PUMA and MDM2 were all upregulated Supplementary Figure S1A . Activation of p53 seemed to restrict further endoreduplication through imposing cell cycle arrest , as evident from the lack of S-phase cells at 48 and 72 h after drug treatment Figure 1 . Taken together , our data suggest that p53 response is activated in response to aurora kinase inhibition but is insufficient to completely protect against endoreduplication . VX-680 induces tetraploid G2 arrest . We did a careful time course analysis of the DNA content of A549 p53 wild type after VX-680 treatment and found that cells arrested briefly in G2 M at 16 h with predominantly 4N DNA content before a second round of DNA replication was initiated at 16 h Figure 2a . After 48 h , more than 35 % of cells were arrested in tetraploid G2 M 8N Figure 2a . Analysis of the mitotic indexes suggests that cells were arrested in G2 and not in mitosis the mitotic index peaked at 16 h after treatment with VX-680 but subsequently decreased to 2 % at 48 h Supplementary Figure S1B . Together , the results confirmed that the 8N cells were arrested predominantly in Table 1 Tumor-derived and primary cell lines used in this study Cell line p53 status G2 and VX-680 inhibited mitosis in part through a G2 checkpoint . To elucidate the mechanism underlying the observed G2 arrest , we examined both cyclin A2-Cdk2 and cyclin B1-cdc2 , protein complexes known to have crucial roles in the regulation of the G2�M transition.14�16 A careful time course analysis of the cyclin-associated kinase activities revealed a rapid reduction of cyclins A2-and B1-associated kinase activities Figure 2b . Cyclin-dependent kinase 2 Cdk2 and cell division cycle 2 cdc2 kinase activities were also markedly reduced to undetectable levels , but this was neither a result of substantial changes in the levels of cdc2 Cdk2 protein nor of inhibitory tyrosine phosphorylation.17 As the kinase activity of Cdk2 or cdc2 requires binding to the appropriate cyclins , we reasoned that the ablation of cdc2 Cdk2 kinase activities could be because of a change in the intracellular levels of cyclins A2 and B1 . Indeed , a time-dependent decrease in the protein levels of cyclins A2 and B1 , correlating with the kinetics of suppression of Cdk activities Figure 2c , was observed . p53 imposes a caffeine-resistant G2 checkpoint in part through a p21-dependent repression of cyclins A2 and B1 mRNAs . We noticed that both cyclins were depleted in A549 cells but remained unchanged in A549 cells transfected with p53 siRNA Figures 2c and Supplementary Figure S2D . Similarly , depletion of cyclin A2 protein and , to a lesser extent , cyclin B1 protein were observed in VX-680-treated wild-type HCT116 but not in the derivatives HCT116p53 or HCT116p21 Figure 2e data not shown . Loss of cyclins A2 and B1 occurs at the transcriptional level as their mRNAs were greatly reduced in the wild-type cells but not in p53 or p21 cells Figure 3 . Given that the promoters of cyclins A2 and B1 genes contain p53 regulatory elements , 18 a plausible explanation is that accumulated p53 protein directly represses the transcription of cyclins A2 and B1 genes . Alternatively , the p21 induced by p53 can bind directly to Cdk cyclin complexes , resulting in the sequestration of E2F1 by hypophosphorylated retinoblastoma protein pRb . The repression of cyclins A2 and B1 is specific , as cdc2 protein a reported target of p53-mediated repression19 , shows only a marginal decrease Figure 2c . Although it is tempting to speculate that p53 mediates the repression through a p21-dependent pathway , it is likely that p21-independent activity of p53 also contributes to the observed repression , as HCT116p53 cells show consistently higher levels of cyclins A2 and B1 transcripts when compared with Nutlin confers a long-term proliferative advantage that requires wild-type p53 . Nutlin induced an arrest in HCT116p53 ? ? but not in HCT116p53 Figure 6b . The p53 dependency of nutlin is also demonstrated in A549 with attenuated p53 Supplementary Figure S2 . The proliferative capacity of nutlin-pretreated cells was compared with cells treated only with VX-680 in a colony formation assay . VX-680 treatment alone drastically reduced the number of A549 colonies Figure 6c upper panel . It is noteworthy that nutlin alone moderately decreases the number of surviving colonies . However , when the cells were pretreated with nutlin-3 , the fraction of surviving colonies was enhanced up to 20-fold Figures 6c and d . Similarly , HCT116p53 ? ? cells show markedly better survival up to 15-fold when pre-treated with nutlin-3 than in the presence of VX-680 alone . In contrast , nutlin-3 pretreatment did not affect the colony survival rate in p53-deficient HCT116 Figures 6c and d . We further studied the responses of p53 wild-type and p53-deficient cells in co-culture system , in which both cell types were cultured together for the duration of the experiment . HCT116p53 ? ? and the HCT116p53 cells were distinguished using green fluorescent protein GFP and red fluorescent protein RFP fluorescent markers . Equal numbers of HCT116p53 ? ? green and HCT116p53 red cells were mixed and plated in 10 cm plates , before exposure to a similar drug dosage regimen as described in Figure 6c . At 5 days after drugs removal , the total number of HCT116p53 ? ? green cells in the mixed population pretreated with nutlin-3 was far more than the number of HCT116p53 red cells Figure 6e when compared with DMSO-treated control , which showed an equal proportion of both cell types . The mixed population treated only with nutlin-3 showed a decreased ratio of HCT116p53 ? ? green cells to HCT116p53 red cells , perhaps due to the inhibition of cell proliferation over the period of drug treatment . These experiments reinforce the two key observations made in this study 1 nutlin pretreatment renders increased survival of cells expressing wild-type p53 , whereas single treatment with VX-680 abrogates proliferation of wild-type p53 cells , and 2 pretreatment with nutlin confers selective growth advantage on cells expressing wild-type p53 , resulting in the preferential killing of p53-deficient cells by VX-680 . p53 family member , p73 , contributes to apoptosis and decreases polyploidy in response to VX-680 . Recent reports suggest a role for p73 in the SAC and suppression of tetraploidy.22 Given that isolated p73 loss may result in impaired proliferation and premature senescence due to compensatory upregulation of p53,23 we decided to analyze the effects of loss of p73 functions in a p53-deficient background and asked whether p73 loss further attenuates the response to VX-680 in p53-deficient cells . We have generated two clones stably expressing p73DD , a dominant-negative suppressor of p73 , in HCT116p53 background Supplementary Figure S6 . First , we established that the transcriptional activation of endogenous genes p21 and PUMA in VX-680-treated p53-deficient cells was dependent on p73 Figure 8a . p21 levels were diminished by at least threefold and PUMA levels were decreased by twofold in p73DD-expressing cells . Second , we detected more polypoid cells containing 16N DNA in p73DD-expressing cells when compared with control cells treated with VX-680 Figure 8d . Third , despite an increase in the percentage of polyploidy , there is an overall decrease in apoptosis in p73DD-expressing cells . A significant decrease in the annexin-V-positive fraction was observed in both p73DD C1.4 and p73DD C1.7 clones when compared with the control population Figure 8e . Colony survival assay also indicated that loss of p73 transcriptional activity in p53-deficient cells increased colony numbers after treatment with VX-680 Figure 8c . Taken together , our results support a role for p73 in activating apoptosis and suppressing polyploidy in response to VX-680 in p53-deficient cells , and loss of p73 leads to increased survival of cells with aberrant DNA content . Although p73 and p53 share many overlapping targets of transcriptional regulation , p73 does not seem unlike p53 to be critical for regulating the expression of cyclins A and B mRNA transcript and protein levels of cyclins A2 and B1 remain largely unchanged in p53 p73DD cells treated with VX-680 Supplementary Figure S7 . Collectively , these data indicated that p53 and p73 may exert an effect through distinct mechanisms to suppress endoreduplication and apoptosis . Discussion The aim of cancer chemotherapy is to selectively kill tumor cells without affecting normal cells . However , this is difficult to achieve as many chemotherapeutics are toxic to all dividing cells . This imposes a limitation on the therapeutic window within which a drug can be effectively administered , before the toxicity of this damage to the normal tissues becomes intolerable to patient . Therefore , finding a way to circumvent this problem may significantly improve the therapeutic indexes of existing drugs and discover some new uses for drugs that may have been failed previous preclinical tests because of toxicity issues . By exploiting the difference s between the abilities of normal and cancer cells to undergo cell cycle arrest , one could design a set of strategies to selectively induce growth arrest in normal cells while leaving cancer cells cycling in the presence of mitotic or S-phase inhibitors . p53 mutations occur in 50 % of all human cancers , and in many remaining tumors , p53 pathways are inactivated through different mechanisms . Therefore , selective pharmacologic activation of p53 and the induction of a reversible cell cycle arrest in normal tissues could protect them from chemotherapeutic drugs that target the cell cycle , while not reducing the toxicity of the drugs for tumor cells in which the p53 pathway has been inactivated by mutation . The aims of this study are to analyze whether 1 normal cells expressing wild-type p53 can be protected from endoreduplication and apoptosis induced by aurora kinase inhibition , and 2 pretreatment with an �arrest-inducing factor� increases the selectivity of the second chemotherapeutic drug for cancer cells . Although reports have suggested that nutlin induces senescence , a state of irreversible arrest , recent findings24,25 and our results suggest that nutlin-3 treatment induces reversible growth arrest , but not senescence , in normal epithelial cells and cancer cells expressing wild-type p53 . The nongenotoxic activation of p53 by nutlin-3 in vivo is well tolerated in nude mice without significant adverse side effects , 8 and studies using a myc inhibitor have shown that the blocking of cell division in normal tissues for up to a week is reversible without pathology.26 Pharmacologic activation of p53 selectively protects p53 wild-type cells from endoredupli-cation and confers a long-term proliferative advantage Figures 5 and 6 . The increase in survival of p53-positive cells was partly attributed to the protection against apoptosis . As expected , the survival response of p53 cells to VX-680 was not affected by nutlin . It is interesting to note that a small fraction of p53 cells survive after VX-680 . One may speculate that these polyploid cells have acquired resistance to apoptosis . Indeed , some tetraploidy cells are more resistant to DNA-damaging agents , 27 providing selective survival advantage for p53 mutant cells.28 Alternatively , a small number of cells may have escaped the effects of VX-680 and remained diploid throughout the drug treatment and recovery period . In the latter case , it is possible that repeated drug exposure could further eliminate the �survivors� . In a co-culture assay , we observed an increase in the proportion of p53 ? ? GFP-labeled to p53 RFP-labeled cells only when they were pre-incubated with nutlin Figure 6e . The change in the ratio of the two cell types is unlikely to be due to the difference in the rates of their cell growth , as the untreated control showed almost equal numbers of both cell types . Rather , we conclude that nutlin VX-680 combination is selectively toxic to the p53-deficient cells , whereas cells expressing wild-type p53 retain their proliferative capacity . It is noteworthy that nutlin-only treat-ment led to a decrease in the ratio of green to red cells instead . This is likely due to an inhibition of the proliferation of p53 ? ? cells but not p53 cells during the period of drug treatment and caution against the use of low dose of nutlin as a monotherapy agent , especially when the p53 gene status in the tumors is unclear . Our results suggest that nutlin VX-680 combination may discriminate between p53-positive cells and p53-deficient cells , resulting in a selective killing of p53-compromised cells . Encouragingly , Sur et al.29 recently demonstrated that nutlin pretreatment in a mouse model protected against a major dose-limiting toxicity of a PLK1 inhibition , neutropenia , suggesting that the nutlin VX-680 combination may also have therapeutic benefits . Is the observed G2 arrest a result of activation of a DNA-damage-related checkpoint ? Although aurora kinase inhibi-tion led to increased genomic instability , as suggested by increased micronuclei formation Supplementary Figure S4 , an appearance of aberrant nuclear morphology and possibly an accumulation of chromosomal DNA damage , it is unclear whether the canonical ATM-dependent DNA damage response pathways are activated . We did not find any conclusive evidence that indicated a role for ATM in the checkpoint . In line with this , inhibitory phosphorylation at Tyr15-cdc2 , a common mechanism for G2 checkpoint arrest after DNA damage , 17 did not accumulate in response to aurora kinase inhibition Figure 2c . How then is p53 activated , if not through an ATM-dependent pathway ? There may be several possibilities , either as a direct consequence of inhibition of aurora kinases , 30 and or , indirectly 1 as a result of the disruption of centrosomal functions and activation of p38 kinase , 31 or 2 through the cellular sensing of tetraploidy formation . The latter mechanism is still debatable as mammalian cells do not seem to have a mechanism for detecting ploidy.32 The tumor suppressor Fbwx7 regulates p53 activity and suppress polyploidy in response to mitotic toxins , 33 and loss of Fbwx7 leads to an upregulation of aurora A protein levels.34 In this context , it would be interesting to further define the molecular relationships between Fbwx7 aurora A p53 and ask whether aurora kinase inhibition VX-680-induced activation of p53 requires Fbwx7 . The role of p73 in mediating the response to aurora kinase inhibition by VX-680 is unclear , although it has been implicated in tetraploidy.22,23,35,36 We demonstrated that overexpression of p73DD , a dominant-negative inhibitor of p73 , results in tetraploidy , even in unperturbed cells . Tetra-ploid p53 cells survive probably because of the absence of p53 , as expression of p73DD in a wild-type p53 background led to apoptosis Figure 8f . However , when HCTT16p53 cells were treated with VX-680 , they underwent a p73-dependent apoptosis p73DD overexpression resulted in a moderate increase in polyploidy and increase in surviving colonies Figures 8c�e . Although the role of p73 in regulating ploidy may be due to its ability to interact with spindle checkpoint proteins , 22 we can not rule out a role for its transactivation-dependent functions at this point . Inhibition of p73 in HCTT16p53 downregulates the endogenous expression of PUMA in response to VX-680 Figure 8a and this correlates with the decrease in apoptosis Figure 8e . Although the transcriptional targets of p73 and p53 overlap to some extent , the repression of cyclins A2 and B1 genes in response to VX-680 seem to be independent of p73 , when p53 is absent Supplementary Figure S7 . This suggests that p73 and p53 may have distinct roles in the regulation of tetraploidy and polyploidy p53 imposes a cell cycle arrest dependent on the activation of p21 and repression of cyclins A2 and B1 , whereas p73 might have a more direct role in regulating tetraploidy and apoptosis , through its interaction with the mitotic checkpoint proteins and transcriptional regulation of PUMA . This may also explain why p53 cells are chromosomally stable unless perturbed , whereas dereg-ulation of p73 in p53 background results in tetraploidy even when unperturbed . In this study we have shown that a combination of nutlin VX-680 results in the selective killing of p53-compromised cells and the reversible inhibition of proliferation in cells expressing wild-type p53 . We propose that the combination of a p53-specific activator and an aurora kinase inhibitor may have therapeutic benefits and could potentially alleviate the side effects of aurora kinase inhibition . The clinical approval of nutlin or nutlin-like drugs will allow such exciting concepts to be tested in the clinic . Meanwhile , the results presented in this study and those of Sur et al.29 suggest that extensive pre-clinical testing in murine cancer models is justified .

20339379	www.nature.com cdd Autophagy is an intracellular , lysosome-mediated catabolic mechanism that is responsible for the bulk degradation and recycling of damaged or dysfunctional cytoplasmic compo-nents and intracellular organelles.1 It is an evolutionarily ancient cellular response to intra-and extracellular noxious stimuli , which may precede or coexist with apoptosis , and it may be induced by apoptotic stimuli.2 Autophagy serves to maintain cellular metabolism through recycling of cellular components when the availability of external nutrient sources is limited . In contrast , autophagy develops as a primary response to stress stimuli and then triggers either apoptosis or necrotic cell death.3 The functional relationship between apoptosis and autophagy is complex in the sense that the type of the initiating stimulus might determine which process will dominate . For example , during nutrient deprivation , the default pathway would be autophagy , which creates a meta-bolic state with high or increased ATP and is anti-apoptotic.4 Successful removal of damaged organelles , followed by repair and adaptation , would allow for survival , whereas failure to restore homeostasis would result in delayed apoptosis . By contrast , the default pathway that is triggered by other signals such as DNA damage or death-receptor activation would be immediate apoptosis , which occurs in a rapid , self-amplifying process , precluding simultaneous autophagic responses . As in normal cells , autophagy is activated in tumor cells by stress , including starvation , hypoxia and factor deprivation , 5 which enables long-term survival , particularly when apoptosis is defective.6,7 However , tumor cells were shown to have less potential to induce autophagy or to suppress consumption in response to stress , which can lead to metabolic catastrophe in which energetic demand exceeds production.8 This metabolic fragility of tumor cells has suggested therapeutic starvation as an approach to cancer therapy to exploit an inherent difference between normal and tumor cells.9 Several studies indicate that although autophagy supports tumor cell survival , many tumors may paradoxically have autophagy suppressed.10 Therefore , establishing how the functional status of auto-phagy influences tumorigenesis and treatment response has clinical implications . Primitive neuroectodermal tumors PNETs of the central nervous system , such as neuroblastoma and medullo-blastoma , still present a therapeutic challenge and require novel treatment approaches . Differential expression of secreted protein acidic rich in cysteine SPARC has been observed in various human cancers , and it is unclear why it has variable effects on tumor growth in different tissues . SPARC appears to function as a tumor suppressor in ovarian cancer , 11 pancreatic cancer12 and acute myeloid leukemia.13 Moreover , in tumor xenograft models , a greater growth of pancreatic cancer cells was observed in SPARC mice in comparison with wild type SPARC ? ? .12 Previous studies have shown that SPARC retards the growth of tumors through its ability to enhance apoptosis . This has been shown in studies in which exogenous exposure to SPARC resulted in enhanced apoptosis in ovarian cancer cells , 11 whereas its absence endogenously diminished this event.12 The aim of this study was to determine the functional significance of SPARC expression in PNET cells . In addition , we examined the possible mechanisms by which SPARC expression might elicit therapeutic responses in PNET cells . To address these aims , we used an adenovirus construct expressing full-length SPARC cDNA to induce SPARC expression in human medulloblastoma and neuroblastoma cell lines and studied its effect on cell death . We show that SPARC expression-induced autophagy followed by mitochondria-dependent apoptotic cell death . Results Ad-DsRed-SP infection-induced SPARC mRNA trans - cription in PNET cells . We constructed an E1 E3-defec-tive recombinant adenovirus encoding the SPARC gene under the control of the immediate early promoter from cytomegalovirus Ad-DsRed-SP . The replication-deficient vector , which encodes the RFP gene under the CMV controls Ad-DsRed , served as the empty vector adenovirus control . To confirm expression of the SPARC protein from the engineered adenovirus , we infected PNET cells medulloblastoma and neuroblastoma cells with virus-containing culture supernatants . Western blotting and RT-PCR analysis of SPARC protein and mRNA , respectively , in medulloblastoma and neuroblastoma cells revealed that adenoviral-mediated delivery of the SPARC cDNA to PNET cells markedly enhanced the expression of SPARC protein and mRNA in a dose-dependent manner as compared with mock and Ad-DsRed-infected controls . Figure 1a shows that at 100 MOI , SPARC protein and mRNA levels increased up to approximately threefold Po0.01 versus Ad-DsRed control and approximately three-to fourfold Po0.01 versus Ad-DsRed control , respectively . SPARC overexpression increased sub-G1 peaks and TUNEL-positive cells in tumor cells . Quantitative evalu - ation of apoptosis was performed by FACS analysis of PNET cells infected with various doses of Ad-DsRed-SP and compared with mock and Ad-DsRed controls . DNA frequency distribution histograms in which the sub-G1 region corresponded to apoptotic cells indicated that Ad-DsRed-SP infection increased the number of apoptotic cells by 49.15� 2.25 % , 56.7�4 % and 53.4�2.24 % with 100 MOI in Daoy , D283 and SH-SY5Y cells , respectively , as compared with 5.0�2 % in Ad-DsRed-infected controls Figure 2a , Supplementary Figure 1 . In addition , SPARC significantly increased TUNEL-positive apoptotic cells in medulloblas-toma and neuroblastoma cells in a concentration-dependent manner Figure 2b , Supplementary Figure 2 In addition , we also show that SPARC expression disrupts mitochondrial Figure 1 Overexpression of SPARC in PNET cells . The human full-length SPARC cDNA was cloned into the Adeno-X ViraTrak DsRed Expression System , termed as Ad-DsRed-SP , and Ad-DsRed is the viral vector without the SPARC gene . DAOY , D283 and SH-SY5Y cells PNET cells were infected with mock PBS control , 100 MOI of Ad-DsRed and the indicated MOI 10 , 25 , 50 and 100 MOI of Ad-DsRed-SP for 48 h. a SPARC levels were determined by western blot analysis using SPARC-specific antibody . GAPDH served as loading control . b cDNA was produced from total RNA extracted from the mock and infected cells . RT-PCR was performed for SPARC . Results are representative of three independent experiments . GAPDH served as a control for RNA quality columns , mean of three experiments bars , S.D. . *Po0.05 , difference between Ad-DsRed and Ad-DsRed-SP 50 MOI treatment @ Po0.01 , difference between Ad-DsRed and Ad-DsRed-SP 100 MOI membrane potential in PNET tumor cells Supplementary Figure 3 , an early event in apoptosis.14 In this study , SPARC expression-induced cleavage of caspases-8 , -3 and poly-ADP-ribose polymerase PARP Figure 2c and released cytochrome c into cytosol Figure 2d , in medulloblastoma and neuroblastoma cells in a dose-dependent manner . Further , SPARC overexpression in PNET cells increased Bid cleavage t-Bid Figure 2d and , caspase-3 and -8 activity in a dose-dependent manner when compared with mock or Ad-DsRed controls Figure 2e . These results indicate that SPARC expression-induced apoptosis in PNET cells . SPARC overexpression induces autophagy vacuoles AVOs in neuroblastoma and medulloblastoma cells . We next sought to determine the sequential biological events connecting SPARC expression and apoptosis . Inspection of SPARC overexpressed cells under light microscopy revealed the presence of microscopic vacuoles , which formed as early as 12 h of after infection with Ad-DsRed-SP . The formation of vacuoles was apparent when compared with the mock and Ad-DsRed control . SPARC expression clearly induced the accumulation of AVOs with their characteristic double membranes , as visible by transmission electron microscopy Supplementary Figure 4 . Autophagy is characterized by AVO formation , and measured by vital staining of acridine orange . Acridine orange moves freely to cross biological membranes and accumulates in acidic compartment , in which it is observed as fluorescence bright red.15 Vital staining of PNET cells with acridine orange showed the accumulation of AVO in the cytoplasm of cells infected with Ad-DsRed-SP compared with controls Supplementary Figure 5 . Evaluation of autophagy was further performed through analysis of microtubule-associated protein I light chain 3 LC3 expression , which is a reliable marker of autophagosomes.16 Immunoblot analyses of proteins from Ad-DsRed-SP-infected cells revealed a dose-dependent increase in the expression of LC3-II 15 kDa , a surface protein marker of autophagosomes , which is ultimately degra-ded by acidic hydrolases after the formation of autolysosomes in PNET cells Figure 3a .17 To further confirm that SPARC overexpression induces autophagy PNET cells were treated with bafilomycin A1 , a vacuolar type H ? -ATPase inhibitor , with or without Ad-DsRed-SP treatment and the accumulation of LC3-II protein was determined . Western blot showed that bafilomycin A1 increased the protein levels of LC3-II in a dose-dependent manner Figure 3b . The process of autophagosome formation is regulated by several autophagy genes Atgs , Atg-5 or Atg-6 Beclin-1.18 Therefore , the interconnection between SPARC-induced autophagy and apoptosis was further analyzed using Atg-5-specific siRNA and 3-methyl adenine 3-MA , a pharmacologic inhibitor of autophagy , a nucleotide derivative that blocks class III PI3K activity.19 Transfection with Atg-5 siRNA inhibited autophagy and significantlydecreasedcaspase-8 , -3 Po0.05 and PARP cleavage Po0.01 Figure 3c and the activity levels of caspase-8 , -3 Supplementary Figures 6 and 7 . Further , Atg-5 siRNA tranfection decreased TUNEL-positive cells Supplementary Figure 8 in Ad-DsRed-SP-infected cells Figure 3c . Similarly , treatment with 3-MA also decreased cleavage of caspase-3 Po0.05 and PARP Po0.05 and inhibited the activity levels of caspase-8 , -3 , Supplementary Figure 6 and 7 as well as TUNEL-positive cells Supplemen-tary Figures 8 and 9 in Ad-DsRed-SP-infected cells . Collec-tively , these results suggested that autophagy precedes apoptosis in SPARC-overexpressed PNET cells . Cathepsin B mediates SPARC-induced apoptosis in PNET cells . There is growing recognition that alternative proteolytic enzymes , such as the lysosomal cathepsin proteases , can initiate or propagate pro-apoptotic signals.20,21 We therefore determined the expression of cathepsins in Ad-DsRed-SP-infected PNET cells . Figure 4a shows that SPARC expression induced a dose-dependent increase in cathepsin B but not in cathepsins D or L as determined by western blotting . In addition , SPARC expression induced a three-to four-fold increase in cathepsin B activity levels in all the three cell lines compared with mock and Ad-DsRed controls Figure 4b . To further validate the role of autophagy in cathepsin B induction , we treated Ad-DsRed-SP-infected cells with the autophagy inhibitor Atg-5 siRNA or 3-MA . Atg-5 siRNA treatments and 3-MA clearly reversed SPARC-induced cathepsin B protein Figures 3c and 4c expression and activity Supplementary Figure 10 . The role of cathepsin B in SPARC-induced apoptosis was determined by treating Ad-DsRed-SP-infected cells with the cathepsin B-specific inhibitor CA-074 Me. Figure 4d shows that cathepsin B inhibition did not alter LC3-II expression , indicating that cathepsin B is not involved in SPARC-induced autophagy . However , cathepsin B inhibition significantly reduced the SPARC-induced apoptosis as shown by a decrease in the levels of cleaved caspase-3 Po0.05 and cleaved PARP Po0.05 compared with Ad-DsRed-SP-infected cells treated with DMSO and reversed SPARC-induced apoptotic index Supplementary Figure 11 . These findings confirm the pivotal role of cathepsin B in cell death induced by SPARC in PNET cells . BID as putative cathepsin B target in SPARC-induced apoptosis . In some cell types , cathepsin B-initiated apop-tosis occurs by a process associated with mitochondrial release of cytochrome c.22 We therefore determined whether SPARC-induced apoptosis involves this pathway in PNET cells infected with Ad-DsRed-SP and assessed whether cathepsin B was upstream of mitochondrial involvement . The levels of cytosolic cytochrome c were evaluated by immunoblotting . As shown in Figure 5a , cells infected with Ad-DsRed-SP showed a dose-dependent release of cytochrome c into the cytosol as compared with mock and Ad-DsRed-infected cells . Further , Ad-DsRed-SP infection decreased mitochondrial membrane potential in a dose-dependent manner in PNET cells Supplementary Figure 3 . In addition , the role of cathepsin B in mediating cytochrome c release was determined by treating Ad-DsRed-SP-infected cells with cathepsin B-specific inhibitor CA-074 Me . Cathepsin B inhibition decreased the SPARC-induced release of cytochorome c indicating that the release is due to cathepsin B activity as shown in Figures 5b and c . Collectively , these results place cathepsin B upstream of the mitochondria in the SPARC-induced apoptotic cascade in PNET cells . Cathepsin B was shown to activate Bid.23 Activated Bid causes the release of cytochrome c from mito-chondria and subsequent activation of downstream effector caspases , which carry out the final cleavage steps responsible for the cellular disassembly characteristic of apoptosis.24 In this study , the role of Bid in SPARC-mediated apoptosis was studied by knocking down Bid expression using siRNA . The expression of Bid was markedly suppres-sed in PNET cells transfected with Bid siRNA but not those with control siRNA Figure 5d . SPARC-induced release of cytochrome c and cleavage of caspase-3 and PARP were decreased in Bid siRNA-transfected cells com-pared with SPARC expressed cells transfected with control siRNA Figure 5d . These findings indicate that cathepsin B induces apoptosis through Bid cleavage in SPARC over-expressed PNET cells . Exogenous SPARC expression causes tumor growth inhibition in nude mice . To directly evaluate the effect of SPARC on tumor formation in vivo , we stereotactically implanted Daoy cells , genetically engineered to express the firefly luciferase gene , intracranially in nude mice . The tumors that arose were challenged with intratumoral injec-tions of Ad-DsRed-SP . Tumor growth was monitored in mice by using in vivo imaging system Xenogen , IVIS , Hopkinton , MA , USA . Representative data are shown in Figure 6a . There was significant decrease in the tumor volume in mice treated with Ad-DsRed-SP compared with mice treated with mock PBS and Ad-DsRed . Furthermore , IVIS image analysis also highly correlated with the volume of tumor as assessed by methods described earlier.25 Histologic analysis of H E stained tumor sections showed approximately 55�60 % reduction of tumor volume Pp0.001 in the brains of mice treated with Ad-DsRed-SP as compared with Ad-DsRed controls Figure 6b . To determine whether SPARC caused cathepsin B-mediated apoptosis in vivo , tumor sections were immunoassayed for SPARC , cathepsin B and cleaved Bid t-Bid . Apoptotic content was determined by TUNEL analysis . Figure 6c shows that , consistent with our in vitro observations , tumor sections from Ad-DsRed-SP-treated mice showed increased staining for SPARC , cathepsin B and t-Bid . Furthermore , the apoptotic index of tumor cells quantified by the number of positive cells for TUNEL staining , increased with Ad-DsRed-SP treatment Figure 6d . Discussion In this study , we report that SPARC is a strong inducer of autophagy as well as apoptosis . These two processes can be induced in response to cellular stresses in a number of ways such that the induction of autophagy apoptosis can occur sequentially , simultaneously or in a mutually exclusive manner.26�28 Our study shows that autophagy develops as a primary response to SPARC expression and then triggers apoptosis in medulloblastoma and neuroblastoma cell lines . SPARC expression induced several markers of autophagy in human medulloblastoma Daoy and D283 and neuroblas-toma SH-SY5Y cells . Cell lysates were analyzed by western blotting to detect both cyto-plasmic LC3-I and its proteolytic derivative LC3-II that preferentially associates with autopha-gosomal membranes.29 SPARC triggers an increase of LC3-II with respect to LC3-I in all the three cell lines Figure 3a . In addition , we used mRFP-LC3 to determine whether SPARC-induced autophagy in PNET cells . Previous studies show that detection of the mRFP-LC3 signal in lysosomes was dependent on autophagy and that autophagy will induce LAMP1 lysosomal marker , localization with mRFP-LC3 expression.30 We therefore determined mRFP-LC3 expres-sion in SPARC-overexpressed PNET cells . SPARC over-expression in PNET cells induced autophagy as shown by mRFP-LC3 localization in perinuclear region when compared with mock or Ad-DsRed cells . Further , mRFP-LC3 colocalized with LAMP1 in SPARC overexpressed cells Supplementary Figure 12 . We determined the role of various caspases because we observed an increase in sub-G1 population and an increase in TUNEL-positive cells , in SPARC over-expressed cells . We observed an increase in caspase-8 cleavage and therefore determined the role of this caspase in SPARC-mediated apoptosis . We used caspase-8-specific inhibitor and determined Bid cleavage and cytocrome c release and caspase-3 and PARP cleavage levels . Our data indicate that caspase-8 inhibitor decreased t-Bid and cyto-chrome c levels suggesting that caspase-8 mediates Bid cleavage in SPARC overexpressed cells Supplementary Figure 6 Tumorigenicity in vivo . Luciferase-labeled Daoy cells were implanted intracranially in nude mice and treated with intratumoral injections of mock , Ad-DsRed and Ad-DsRed-SP as described in Materials and methods . A total of six animals were studied in each group . a Noninvasive bioluminescence imaging of luciferase-expressing intracranial Daoy xenografts after six weeks . b Six weeks later treatment , animals were perfused and the brains harvested and processed . Tissue was stained with H E per standard protocol inset 40 . Tumor volume is represented graphically by measuring region of interest in IVIS . c Immuno-histochemical analysis of SPARC , cathepsin B and cleaved Bid t-Bid expressions in brain sections as described in Materials and methods . Cathepsin B Red and t-Bid Green are double labeling for the same section . d Staining for TUNEL was performed on the tumor tissue sections , and representative images of the indicated treatment groups are shown . Arrows indicate representative TUNEL-positive apoptotic cells . The positive-staining apoptotic cells were counted from five sections per tumor tissue from three animals per treatment are represented ROI , region of interest , columns , mean of three experiments bars , S.D . Further experiments were performed to determine how cathepsin B might be affecting this apoptotic cascade in Ad-DSRed-SP-infected cells . The cathepsin proteases could induce apoptosis by a variety of different mechanisms.41 One possibility is that cathepsins could nonspecifically degrade important cellular proteins , thereby causing the cell to initiate apoptosis.42 Alternately , cathepsins can directly cleave caspase zymogens and caspases e.g. , caspase-3 .43 Another mode of cathepsin action places cathepsins far upstream in the apoptotic cascade , cleaving the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member Bid to initiate mitochondrial release of cytochrome c . We found clear evidence for Bid cleavage activation in SPARC overexpressed cells . We therefore tested whether the pro-apoptotic signaling by lysosomal cathepsin B proceeds through the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member Bid in SPARC overexpressed cells . Transfection with Bid siRNA before Ad-DsRed-SP infection inhibited SPARC-induced apoptosis suggesting that Bid is the putative target for cathepsin B-mediated apoptosis in SPARC-induced cells . Similarly , cathepsin B and its substrate Bid were shown to be molecular links between apoptosis and autophagy in breast cancer MCF-7 cells exposed to the cytostatic drug , camptothecin inhibitor of DNA topoisomerase I .35 In conclusion , we show for the first time that autophagy and apoptosis are sequentially triggered by SPARC through the cathepsin B-mediated , mitochondria-dependent pathway Scheme 1 . This conclusion is based on three lines of argumentation 1 inhibition of autophagy using 3-MA Atg-5 siRNA decreased SPARC-mediated apoptosis 2 inhibition of autophagy using 3-MA Atg-5 siRNA blocked SPARC-induced cathepsin B and 3 inhibition of cathepsin B did not alter autophagy but inhibited cytochrome c-mediated apoptosis in SPARC overexpressed cells . Scheme 1 Flow diagram . Schematic representation of the sequence of events leading to apoptosis because of overexpression of SPARC in PNET cells . In this figure , we show for the first time that autophagy and apoptosis are sequentially triggered by SPARC through the cathepsin B-mediated , mitochondria-dependent apoptotic pathway Cell cultures . We used the Daoy ATCC # HTB 186 , D283 Med ATCC # HTB 185 , and SH-SY5Y ATCC # CRL 2266 cell lines . Daoy cells were cultured in Advanced-MEM , D283 cells were cultured in Advanced-MEM Zn option medium without phenol red , and SH-SY5Y cells were cultured in advanced DMEM . All of the above media were supplemented with 5 % fetal bovine serum , 2 mM L-glutamine , 2 mM sodium pyruvate , 100 units ml penicillin and 100 mg ml streptomycin . Cells were maintained in a humidified atmosphere containing 5 % CO2 at 37 1C . Antibodies and reagents . Antibodies against SPARC , caspase-3 , t-Bid , cytochrome c , MAP-LC3 , cathepsin D , cathepsin L and GAPDH were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Santa Cruz , CA , USA . Antibodies against caspase-8 , LC-3 Cell Signaling Technology , Beverly , MA , USA , PARP EMD Biosciences , San Diego , CA , USA and cathepsin B Athens Research and Technology , Athens , GA , USA were also used in this study . Bid siRNA and Atg-5 siRNA were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology . pmRFP-LC3 Addgene plasmid 21075 was obtained from Addgene Inc. Cambridge , MA , USA . The autophagy inhibitor 3-MA , cathepsin B inhibitor CA-074 Me and the caspase 8 inhibitor IETD-Fmk were obtained from Calbiochem San Diego , CA , USA . Adenovirus construction . We constructed two adenoviral vectors , one carrying full-length human SPARC cDNA Ad-Dsred-SP and an empty vector Ad-DsRed using Adeno-X ViraTrak Expression System 2 Clontech Laboratories , Mountain View , CA , USA . SPARC cDNA was cloned in to pDNR-CMV donor vector as per manufacturer�s protocol . To ensure that the correct restriction fragment was cloned , the following compatible restriction sites were added Xho I at the 50 end and Xba I at the 30 end of the primer sequences . The donor vector is the used for recombination with pLP-Adeno-X-CMV-E3-DsRed-Express Vector acceptor vector using Cre Recombinase as per manufacturer�s protocol . The donor vector�s two loxP sites flank the 50 end of the MCS and the 50 end of the chloram-phenicol resistance gene Cmr , and mediate the transfer of these intervening sequences into the acceptor vector . After the Cre-loxP reaction , the recombinant pLP-Adeno-X plasmid can then be used to generate recombinant adenovirus for strong , constitutive expression of the gene . The recombined vector was then digested with PacI enzyme to expose the inverted terminal repeats located at either end of the genome plasmid and to produce virus particles . The adenovirus-containing SPARC cDNA was termed Ad-DsRed-SP and the virus without SPARC cDNA was termed Ad-DsRed . Adenovirus generation , amplification and titer were performed according to previously described procedures.44 Briefly , viral particles were purified using a cesium chloride density gradient . Viral titers were assessed using the plaque-forming unit PFU and by counting infectious virus particles . Adenoviral infection . Infection with recombinant viruses was accomplished by exposing cells to adenovirus in serum-free cell culture medium for 1 h followed by addition of serum-containing medium . Cells were then incubated for varying time periods as detailed in the following experiments . We used Ad-DsRed recombinant adenovirus as a vector control . Western blotting . Western blot analysis was performed as described earlier.45 Briefly , PNET cells were cultured in 100 mm plates and infected with mock , 100 MOI of Ad-DsRed , or various MOI of Ad-DsRed-SP and incubated for 48 h at 37 1C . Cell lysates were prepared in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer and protein concentrations were measured using bicinchoninic acid protein assay regents Pierce , Rockford , IL , USA . Equal amounts of protein was resolved on SDS-PAGE gel and transferred on to PVDF membrane . Next , the blot was blocked and probed overnight with different primary antibodies at 4 1C followed by HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies for 1 h and signals were detected by using ECL reagent . RT-PCR . PNET cells were cultured in 100 mm plates and infected with mock , 100 MOI of Ad-DsRed , or various MOI of Ad-DsRed-SP and incubated for 36 h at 37 1C . Total RNA was extracted from cells as described by Chomczynski and Sacchi.46 The solution was then treated with DNase I Ambion , Austin , TX , USA for 30 min at 37 1C . PCR was performed using an RT-PCR kit Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA , USA as follows 35 cycles of denaturation at 94 1C for 1 min , annealing at 67 1C for 30 s and extension at 72 1C for 90 s . The expected PCR products were resolved on 2 % agarose gels and visualized using ethidium bromide staining . To normalize for the amount of input RNA , RT-PCR was performed with primers for the constitutively expressed GAPDH . SPARC primers , sense 50-GGAAGAAACTGTGGCAGAGG-30 and antisense 50-ATTGCTGCACACCTTCTCAA-3 , and GAPDH primers sense 5-TGAAGGTCGGAGTCAACGGATTTGGT-3 and antisense 5-CATGTGGGCCAT GAGGTCCACCAC-3 . Flow cytometry . For assessment of DNA content , PNET cells were plated overnight in 100 mm tissue culture plates and infected for 48 h as described above . We used FACS analysis that uses propidium iodide staining of nuclear DNA to characterize hypo-diploid cells.47 Briefly , cells were harvested by trypsinization and stained with propidium iodide 2 mg ml in 4 mM sodium citrate containing 3 % w v Triton X-100 and RNase A 0.1 mg ml Sigma , St. Louis , MO , USA . Suspensions of 2 106 cells were analyzed by FACS Caliber System Becton Dickinson Bioscience , San Jose , CA , USA with laser excitation at 488 nm using an emission 639 nm band pass filter to collect the red propidium iodide fluorescence . The percentages of cells in the various phases of the cell cycle , namely , sub-G0 G1 , G0 G1 , S , and G2 M , were assessed using Cell Quest software Becton Dickinson Bioscience . TUNEL assay . To evaluate the apoptotic response of Ad-DsRed-SP , we performed terminal deoxynucleotide transferase TdT -mediated biotin-dUTP nick end labeling TUNEL using the commercially available in situ cell death detection kit Roche , Indianapolis , IN , USA . Briefly , 5000 cells were seeded onto eight-well chamber slides and infected with mock , 100 MOI of Ad-DsRed , or various MOIs of Ad-DsRed-SP . After 48 h of infection , the cells were washed and fixed with 4 % buffered para-formaldehyde and permeabilized with freshly prepared 0.1 % Triton-X100 , 0.1 % sodium citrate solution . These cells were then incubated with TUNEL reaction mixture for 1 h at 37 1C in a humidified chamber . The slides were washed three times with PBS and the incorporated biotin-dUTP was detected under a fluorescence microscope . For the paraffin-embedded tissue sections , slides were dewaxed , rehydrated and permeabilized according to the standard protocols and processed as above . Transfection with plasmids . All transfection experiments were performed using fuGene HD transfection reagent according to the manufacturer�s protocol Roche . Briefly , plasmid siRNA was mixed with fuGene HD reagent 1 3 ratio in 500 ml of serum-free medium and left for 30 min to allow for complex formation . The complex was then added to the 100 mm plate , which had 2.5 ml of serum-free medium 2 mg plasmid per ml of medium . After 6 h of transfection , complete medium was added , and cultured for another 24 h . Measurement of cathepsin B activity . Cathepsin B activity was measured by cathepsin B activity assay kit BioVision , Mountain View , CA , USA . Briefly , cells were washed with the PBS , and lysed in chilled cathepsin B cell lysis buffer . After incubation on ice for 10 min , 10 mM cathepsin B substrate Ac-RR-AFC , 200 mM final concentration was added and incubated at 37 1C for 2 h as indicated in manufacturer�s protocol . The release of free amino-4-trifluoromethyl coumarin was monitored in a fluorometer Fluoroskan ascent , Thermo LabSystems , Waltham , MA , USA with a 409 nm excitation filter and 515 nm emission filter.48 Measurement of caspase-3 and caspase-8 activity . The caspase-3 and -8 activity assays were performed using specific colorimetric activity assay kits Chemicon International , Billerica , MA , USA as per the manufacturer�s instructions . Briefly , samples were resuspended in chilled cell lysis buffer and incubated on ice for 10 min . After centrifugation , the cytosolic extract was collected , and the assay mixture was prepared in a 96-well plate . To further confirm the specificity of casapse-3 or -8 activity , the samples were preincubated with the caspase-3 or -8 inhibitors sample for 30 min at room temperature before adding the caspase-3 substrate solution . Assay mixtures were incubated for 2 h at 37 1C , and caspase activities were measured by reading the absorbance of their products at 405 nm in a microtiter plate reader . Transmission electron microscopy . Cells were fixed in 2.5 % glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M cacodylic buffer , pH 7.4 for 2 h at 4 1C , washed in 0.1 M cacodylic buffer pH 7.4 overnight , and post-fixed with 1 % osmium tetroxide with 0.8 % K4FeCN6 in cacodylic buffer for 1 h at room temperature . The samples were dehydrated in an ethanol gradient 30 , 50 , 70 , 80 , 90 , 96 and 100 % and propylene oxide and then embedded in Epon 812 . The blocks were cut with Reichert OM3 ultramicrotome and stained with 9 % uranyl acetate and lead citrate 0.2 % solution . Sections were photographed using a JEOL JEM 1 OOC transmission electron microscope JEOL USA , Inc , Peabody , MA , USA . Detection of AVOs by acridine orange . Autophagy vacuolization was visualized by acridene orange as described by Paglin et al.15 Briefly , PNET cells were seeded in 100 mm and were infected with Ad-DsRed-SP as described above . At the appropriate time points , cells were incubated with 1 mg ml acridine orange Molecular Probes , Eugene , OR , USA in serum-free medium for 15 min . The acridine orange was removed and fluorescent micrographs were obtained using an inverted fluorescence microscope . The cytoplasm and nucleus of the stained cells fluoresced bright green , whereas the acidic AVOs fluoresced bright red . Cell fractionation and isolation of mitochondria . All procedures were performed at 4 1C . Controls and Ad-DsRed-SP-treated PNET cells were harvested , washed in PBS and then suspended in isotonic sucrose buffer PES composed of 10 mM phosphate buffer , pH 7.2 , 1 mM EDTA , 1 mM EGTA , 1 mM MgCl2 , 250 mM sucrose , 1 mg ml pepstatin , 1 mg ml leupeptin and 40 mg ml PMSF . Cell homogenates examined by cytospin and Diff-Quick staining showed that 90 % of the cells had been disrupted . The homogenates were centrifuged twice at 800 g for 10 min to remove nuclei and any residual intact cells . The postnuclear supernatant was centrifuged at 10 000 g for 20 min . The pellet crude mitochondrial fraction was washed with PBS two times to remove the sucrose . The 10 000 g supernatant was centrifuged at 100 000 g for 30 min and the resulting supernatant was used as the cytosolic fraction . Subcellular fractionation was confirmed by assaying citrate synthase activity as a marker for the mitochondrial matrix . Lactate dehydrogenase was used as a marker for the cytosolic fraction and was assayed using a kit from Roche Biochemicals Roche . For protein measurements , mitochondria were subjected to three freeze�thaw cycles using liquid N2 and a 37 1C water bath . Protein was measured with the Bio-Rad protein assay kit Bio-Rad Laboratories , Hercules , CA , USA using bovine serum albumin as the standard . Transmembrane potential of the mitochondria . The MitoLight apoptosis detection kit Chemicon International Inc. , Temecula , CA , USA was used as per manufacturer�s instructions . Briefly , PNET cells treated were grown in eight-well chamber slides and infected with AdDsred-SP as described above . After 48 h , the chamber slides were covered with diluted MitoLight reagent solution and incubated for 20 min in a 5 % CO2 incubator at 37 1C . The solution was then replaced with the pre-warmed incubation buffer , and the cells were immediately observed under a fluorescence microscope using an IB cube filter excitation at 460�490 nm emission at 515 nm IX70-FLA . The fluorescent reagent can be accumulated into the mitochondria of healthy cells and aggregates to generate red fluorescence excitation at 585 nm emission at 590 nm . However , in the apoptotic cells , the reagent remains monomer in the cytoplasm , and is fluorescent green excitation at 510 nm emission at 527 nm . Intracranial tumor model . The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Illinois College of Medicine-Peoria approved all experimental procedures involving the use of animals . A small , hand-controlled twist drill was used to make the hole , and a specially devised screwdriver was used to thread and secure the screw into the hole . After a recovery period of 5 days , nude mice were anesthetized and Daoy cells 1 105 cells 5 ml PBS , stably transfected for luc expression , were stereotactically implanted as described elsewhere with minor modifications.49 Two weeks after tumor cell implantation , the animals were randomized into three groups six animals per group . Each mouse received three intratumoral injections on days 15 , 16 and 17 . Group 1 received PBS 6 ml n ? 6 . Group 2 received 5 107 PFU of Ad-DsRed virus in 6 ml of PBS . Group 3 received 5 107 PFU of Ad-DsRed-SP in 5 ml of PBS . Animals , which lost X20 % of body weight or had trouble ambulating , feeding or grooming , were killed . Animals were monitored for up to 90 days , which is when we arbitrarily terminated the experiment . Tumor growth was monitored using in vivo imaging system IVIS every alternate day till the study termination . Mice brains were fixed in 10 % buffered formalin and embedded in paraffin . Tissue sections 5 mm thick were obtained from the paraffin blocks and stained with H E using standard histological techniques . Tissue sections were also subjected to immunostaining with antibodies for SPARC , cathepsin B and t-Bid . After adding FITC or Texas Red conjugated secondary antibody , sections were counterstained with DAPI , and negative control slides were obtained by nonspecific IgG as the primary antibody . After mounting in an anti-fade mounting solution Invitrogen , the samples were analyzed with a fluorescence microscope . Statistical analyses . All data are expressed as mean�S.D.

Further , caspase-8 inhibitor decreased caspase-3 cleavage and activity levels Supplementary Figure 7 and reversed SPARC-mediated PARP cleavage suggesting that caspase-8 mediates SPARC-induced apoptosis . In addition , caspase-8 inhibitor did not alter SPARC-induced LC3-II levels suggesting that SPARC-induced autophagy is independent of caspase-8 activation Supplementary Figure 14 . Our results also reveal that SPARC-induced autophagy precedes apoptotic cell death . We show that specific inhibition of autophagy by treatment with 3-methyladenine or Atg siRNA reduced SPARC-mediated apoptosis . There is evidence that over-stimulation of autophagy can lead to cell death , possibly through activating apoptosis.31 Previous findings that suggest autophagy as a reflection of the therapeutic efficacy of anti-neoplastic agents are the persistent activation of autophagy can lead to programmed cell death32 and that the autophagy regulator beclin 1 BECN1 is a haploinsufficient tumor-sup-pressor gene that induces autophagy when overexpressed.33 It is likely that excessive autophagy destroys a large amount of protein and organelles which , beyond a certain threshold , causes a bioenergetic catastrophe culminating in cell death.34 H2O2 and 2-methoxyestradiol 2-ME induce apoptosis in cells and have recently been shown to induce autophagy leading to cell death in HEK293 and U87 cells.35 This group also found that inhibition of autophagy significantly reduces H2O2 or 2-ME-mediated cell death . Our study provides the first in vitro evidence that cathepsin B is a molecular link between autophagy and apoptosis in SPARC-expressing cells . SPARC expression-induced cathe-psin B expression in PNET cells . Cathepsin B , a lysosomal cysteine protease , has recently been implicated in apopto-sis.36 Lysosomal permeabilization with release of cathepsin B into the cytosol has been associated with mitochondrial dysfunction and caspase-dependent cell death in hepato-cytes.37 SPARC-induced cathepsin B expression is asso-ciated with cytochrome c release and caspase-dependent death in PNET cells . Blocking cathepsin B with a cathepsin B-specific inhibitor prevented SPARC-induced apoptosis , but it did not affect autophagy , thereby suggesting that auto-phagy induces cathepsin B-mediated apoptosis in SPARC-expressing PNET cells . Previous work showed that SPARC potentiated apoptosis by increasing caspase-8 signaling.38 Our work shows that SPARC-induced autophagy-mediated cathepsin B induction , which in turn induced caspase-8-mediated apoptosis because inhibition of autophagy rever-sed SPARC-induced caspase-8-mediated apoptosis . We also show that the brain sections of mice that received Ad-DsRed-SP treatment show remarkable increases in the levels of cathepsin B expression and TUNEL-positive cells as compared with the brain sections of control and Ad-DsRed-treated mice . These results suggest cathepsin B mediates apoptosis in vivo . Studies from other laboratories have also implicated cathepsin B in apoptosis . Pharmacologic inhibition of cathepsin B has been reported to block apoptosis induced by p53 and cytotoxic agents.39 Redistribution of cathepsin B from vesicles to the cytosol has also been shown in neurons undergoing death after global ischemia.40 Cathepsin B was shown to contribute to TNF-a-mediated apoptosis by promoting mitochondrial release of cytochrome c in hepatocytes.36 
20467443	H Matsunaga1,2 and H Ueda* , 1 Prothymosin-a ProTa , a nuclear protein , is widely distributed throughout the body and has various intracellular functions in determining life and death.1,2 ProTa bearing a conventional nuclear localization signal NLS is largely localized in the nucleus , and has important functions in the regulation of cell differentiation and proliferation.1�3 When a cell is subjected to apoptotic stimuli , on the other hand , ProTa is released from the nucleus to the cytosol in which it inhibits apoptosome formation.4 Thus , ProTa is supposed to have a proliferative function in the nucleus under normal conditions , and a self-defensive function in the cytosol under apoptotic conditions . We have recently identified ProTa as a unique anti-neuronal necrosis factor in the conditioned medium CM of cortical neurons , 5 and discovered its potent neuroprotective functions in cerebral and retinal ischemia.6,7 This protein is extracellu-larly released on starving or ischemic stress , and inhibits necrosis by inducing the membrane translocation of glucose transporters , which are endocytosed under ischemic condi-tions , resulting in an acceleration of necrosis owing to energy crisis.5 On the basis of pharmacological analyses , ProTa-induced translocation of glucose transporters is mediated by stimulation of a putative Gi -coupled receptor , phospholipase o C , and protein kinase C PKC bII . This fact indicates that ProTa has another self-defensive function as an extracellular signal under conditions inducing necrosis . However , little is known of the mechanisms underlying extracellular ProTa release . Of importance are the facts that the majority of ProTa content in the nucleus is extracellularly released on stress , before membrane disruption , 5 and that ProTa lacks a signal peptide sequence , which is required for sorting to the endoplasmic reticulum ER -Golgi system before exocytosis . Therefore , ProTa release seems to proceed in a non-classical or non-vesicular manner under ischemic stress conditions . Here , we report the ischemia-induced nuclear release of ProTa , followed by its interaction with S100A13 , a cargo molecule for extracellular release . We also discuss the mechanism underlying the lack of extra-cellular ProTa release under apoptotic conditions . Results Serum-deprivation stress-induced non-classical release of ProTa . ProTa is exclusively localized in the nuclei of various cells , including neurons.1�3 Starvation stress caused by serum deprivation induced a disappearance of ProTa from neurons and astrocytes , as early as 3 h after the start of primary culture Figure 1a . Recently , we discovered the release of this protein into the CM of cultured cortical neurons under serum-free starving conditions causing necrosis.5 As shown in Figure 1b , when serum-derivation stress was given to neurons or astrocytes , the amounts of ProTa in both cell types markedly decreased at 3 h . On the other hand , the ProTa levels in the CM of both cell types in the presence of serum were negligible . However , the serum-deprivation stress caused a significant extracellular release of ProTa from both cell types . Brefeldin A , a blocker of protein transport from the ER to the Golgi apparatus , did not affect ProTa release Figure 1c , suggesting that the manner of release differs from conventional vesicular release . Extracellular release of ProTa was also observed in a rat astroglial C6 glioma cell line after serum deprivation . In C6 glioma cells expressing ProTa-EGFP , the serum-deprivation stress-induced decrease of fluorescence in nuclei started as early as 20 min after serum deprivation , and complete disappearance was observed at 80 min , although a small population of cells below 5 % still retained fluorescence Figure 1d . However , no significant fluorescence signal was observed in the cytosol at these time points , suggesting that stress-induced nuclear export of ProTa is a rate-limiting step in the non-classical extracellular release of ProTa . As seen with primary neurons and astrocytes , brefeldin A did not affect the serum-deprivation stress-induced release of native ProTa release from C6 glioma cells Figure 1e . ATP-dependent nuclear localization of ProTa . We have earlier reported that serum-free starvation stress causes a rapid decrease in cellular ATP levels , leading to necrosis and extracellular ProTa release from the nucleus.5 As shown in Figure 2a , the addition of 2-deoxy-D-glucose 2-DG to cultured C6 glioma cells in serum-containing medium caused a rapid decrease in ATP levels . When the subcellular localization of ProTa was examined Figure 2b , the addition of 2-DG to cells without serum-starvation stress decreased the number of cells showing nuclear localization of ProTa , and increased the number showing cytosol localization . However , no significant extracellular ProTa release was observed . On the other hand , serum-deprivation treatment decreased the number of cells showing nuclear localization and increased the number showing extracellular release . Thus , these results suggest that the loss of cellular ATP induces the transport of ProTa from the nucleus to cytosol , but is not sufficient to cause extracellular release of ProTa from the cytosol . We studied the machinery underlying nucleus-to-cytosol export . When Alexa Fluor488-labeled ProTa and Alexa Fluor568-bovine serum albumin BSA were co-injected into the cytosols of C6 glioma cells , Alexa Fluor488-ProTa was rapidly localized to the nucleus , within 10 min , whereas Alexa Fluor568-BSA remained in the cytosol Figure 2c , upper left 4 panels . Treatment of cells with 2-DG abolished the nuclear localization of Alexa Fluor488-ProTa and redistributed it throughout the cell Figure 2c , upper middle 4 panels . This re-distribution was completely reversed by co-injection of ATP Figure 2c , upper right 4 panels . On the other hand , serum deprivation caused a re-distribution of ProTa from nucleus to cytosol , but did not result in extracellular release in the presence of amlexanox , which inhibits the release of proteins lacking a signal peptide sequence8�11 Figure 2c , lower panels . Similarly , co-injection of ATP reversed the nucleus-to-cytosol export . Thus , it is evident that nuclear localization of ProTa is closely related to the cellular ATP level . Importin a has an important function in the nuclear localization of proteins possessing an NLS . For the sustained localization of such proteins , importin a should be released into the cytosol for repeated use . The GTP-bound form of Ran , a small GTP-binding protein , is known to execute this importin recycling process.12 Therefore , the loss of cellular ATP is expected to impair the nuclear localization of ProTa owing to difficulty maintaining the GTP-bound state of Ran . Indeed , the nuclear localization of ProTa-EGFP was clearly impaired by injection of anti-importin a IgG into C6 glioma cells Figure 2d . However , the nuclear levels of ProTa were not affected by leptomycin B , an inhibitor of the nuclear export receptor CRM1 data not shown . When wheat germ agglutinin , an inhibitor of the nuclear pore complex , was injected into the nuclei of C6 glioma cells , ProTa was redistributed throughout the cells Figure 2e . All of these findings suggest that ProTa is localized in the nucleus through an ATP-dependent importin-NLS mechanism , 13 and that nucleus-to-cytosol export owing to loss of ATP occurs through passive diffusion . Stress-induced extracellular co-release of ProTa with S100A13 . When the CM from serum-deprived C6 glioma cells was immunoprecipitated with anti-ProTa IgG , two significant protein bands were stained by CBB Figure 3a . The upper band was identified as ProTa by immunoblot using an acidic protein transfer procedure.14 The lower band , at approximately 10 kDa , was identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight MALDI-TOF five peptides , 57.1 % coverage followed by MS MS sequence-tag analysis using the NCBI protein database , as S100A13 , a member of the Ca2 ? -binding S100 family.15�17 Immunoblotting also confirmed that this protein is identical to S100A13 . As shown in Figure 3b , naturally occurring ProTa is localized within nuclei , whereas S100A13 is evenly distributed throughout cells . When cultured cells were deprived of serum , both ProTa and S100A13 were completely lost from cells at the time point of 3 h . The cellular loss of S100A13 and ProTa was also blocked by amlexanox , a potent inhibitor of S100A13.8�11,18 Quantitative immunoblot analysis confirmed that amlexanox abolished the serum-deprivation stress-induced extracellular release of ProTa Figure 3c . Protein�protein interaction between ProTa and S100A13 . The interaction between ProTa and S100A13 was characterized by use of various deletion mutants of both proteins . In this study , GST-tagged ProTa and Strep-tagII-S100A13 were used Figure 4a . The addition of Strep-tagII-S100A13 to GST-ProTa immobilized on the sensor tip of a quartz crystal microbalance QCM decreased the quartz oscillation , as quantified by the oscillation unit OU DF in Hz , which represents the degree of interaction between the two proteins , as reported earlier.19 The interaction between proteins was enhanced in the presence of Ca2 ? , but not in the presence of Mg2 ? or Cu2 ? , and this enhancement was Ca2 ? dependent in the range 0.1�200 mM Table 1 Figure 4b . As the Ca2 ? -dependent interaction was further enhanced by the addition of Cu2 ? Table 1 , which has substantial binding affinity for S100A13 , we used the addition of both Ca2 ? and Cu2 ? 100 mM and 100 nM , respectively to determine the best ionic conditions for the interaction between GST-ProTa and Strep-tagII-S100A13 . From the kinetic analysis , 19 the saturated OUmax for the interaction of Strep-tagII-S100A13 with immobilized GST-ProTa 430 fmol was 201.44�3.53 OU , which corresponds to 435.63�7.63 fmol . Therefore , it is evident that ProTa and S100A13 interact at a ratio of 1 1 . The C-terminal domains of several types of S100 family proteins are reported to interact with various target proteins.16 Among these proteins , S100A13 has a unique C-terminal 11-amino-acid sequence RKEKVLAIRKK , which contains as many as six basic amino acids . In the QCM analysis , Strep-tagII-S100A13 lacking this C-terminus amino-acids 88�98 showed no significant interaction with ProTa Figure 4c . On the other hand , in the experiments using immobilized Strep-tagII-S100A13 , the C-terminal deletion mutants ProTa D79�112 and ProTa D102�112 showed decreased potency for interaction association rate constant ka , whereas the N-terminal deletion mutants ProTa D1�68 and ProTa D1�86 did not Figure 4d . As the C-terminal peptide ProTa amino-acids 102�112 TKKQKKTDEDD , but not its reverse peptide DDEDTKKQKKT , inhibited the interaction between GST-ProTa and Strep-tagII-S100A13 Figure 4e , the C-terminal sequence appears to have a crucial function in this interaction . On the contrary , the N-terminal region is presumed to have an unidentified regulatory function in this interaction . Interaction between ProTa and S100A13 is required for the extracellular release of ProTa . To confirm that the stress-induced extracellular release of ProTa depends on the ProTa�S100A13 interaction , we established C6 glioma cells stably expressing Strep-tagII-S100A13 D88�98 , which lacks affinity for ProTa . In the immunocytochemical study , serum-deprivation stress caused an extracellular release of both ProTa and Strep-tagII-S100A13 full-length mutant from C6 glioma cells Figure 5a , left panels , and 5b . However , with the Strep-tagII-S100A13 D88�98 mutant , serum-deprivation stress caused the release of the mutant protein , but not ProTa Figure 5a , right panels , and 5b . This finding suggests that the C-terminal basic residue-rich domain of S100A13 is required for the interaction with ProTa in living cells , and that S100A13 has a function as a cargo molecule involved in the extracellular export of ProTa . To identify the intracellular locales of interaction between ProTa and S100A13 , we performed Strep-tagII pull-down assay using nuclear and cytosolic fractions from C6 glioma cells stably expressing Strep-tagII-S100A13 Figure 5c . In the absence of stress , there was no interaction between Strep-tagII-S100A13 and ProTa in either nuclear or cytosol fraction . Under the serum-deprivation stress , however , a significant interaction was observed in the cytosol fraction , but not in the nuclear one . The level of co-precipitated ProTa in the cytosol was decreased in a time-dependent manner in the range between 1 and 3 h , possibly because of the loss of cytosolic ProTa by extracellular release of both proteins . To evaluate the ProTa�S100A13 interaction in living cells , we performed fluorescence resonance energy transfer FRET analysis . However , the representative FRET analysis using a pair of CFP and YFP was not successful , because the YFP-fused ProTa showed an abnormal distribution . Instead , we attempted to assess the interaction between ProTa-EGFP and DsRed2-S100A13 in the presence of amlexanox , which has no direct effect on their interaction Table 1 . In addition , we performed using phenol red-free DMEM , which does not decrease the survival activity of C6 glioma cells under serum-deprivation condition Supplementary Figure S1 . In the cell population , FRET analysis in the presence of amlexanox , the serum-deprivation stress-induced interaction between ProTa and S100A13 Figure 5d , and ProTa and S100A13 were redistributed throughout the cell Figure 5g . To calculate the FRET efficiency , we performed acceptor photo-bleaching . When the acceptor DsRed2-S100A13 was earlier bleached , serum-deprivation stress did not cause elevation of FRET ratio however , ProTa and S100A13 were also redistributed throughout the cell Figure 5d and g . Next , we performed the single cell FRET analysis in the absence of amlexanox . As shown in Supplementary Figure S2a , the FRET ratio in the cytosol was rapidly increased at 80 min after serum deprivation , whereas then gradually decreased , possibly because of the extracellular release of ProTa�S100A13 complex . In accord with this observation , the fluorescence intensity derived from donor ProTa-EGFP decreased at 80 min , whereas the one derived from acceptor DsRed2-S100A13 transiently increased Supplementary Figure S2b . These results strongly suggest that the interaction between ProTa-EGFP and DsRed2-S100A13 occurs in the cytosol . As shown in Figure 5e , the serum-deprivation stress-induced interaction between ProTa and S100A13 was abolished by the C-terminal 102�112 peptide of ProTa , but not by the reverse peptide . The treatment with C-terminal peptide inhibited the serum - deprivation-induced extracellular release of ProTa , but not S100A13 , whereas the reverse peptide did not inhibit the extracellular release of either protein Figure 5h , upper 6 panels . Ca2 ? influx is involved in the extracellular release of ProTa based on the interaction with S100A13 . In the FRET analysis Figure 5f , the serum-deprivation stress-induced interaction between ProTa and S100A13 was abolished when the cells were treated with EGTA or BAPTA-AM , extracellular and intracellular Ca2 ? -chelating agents , respectively . The serum-deprivation-induced loss of these proteins was also abolished by EGTA or BAPTA-AM Figure 5h , lower 4 panels . Caspase-catalyzed cleavage of ProTa inhibits the stress - induced extracellular release . When C6 glioma cell culture was carried out in various concentrations of serum , significant depletion of ProTa was observed in the absence of serum , but not in the presence of 2 or 10 % serum Figure 6a , upper 6 panels , and 6b . When staurosporine , tunicamycin , and etoposide , which are known to induce apoptosis , were added to 2 % serum medium , ProTa was redistributed throughout the cell Figure 6a , middle 6 panels . However , these apoptogenic compounds did not cause any significant extracellular release of ProTa , but led to the production of large amounts of a smaller ProTa fragment Figure 6b . These re-distribution and fragmentation of ProTa were in a caspase-3 inhibitor zDEVD-fmk-reversible manner Figure 6a , lower 6 panels and 6b . On the other hand , these compounds did not affect intracellular ATP levels Supplementary Figure S3 . When rat ProTa was treated with active caspase-3 , a 13 kDa protein band was time dependently generated in a zDEVD-fmk-reversible manner Figure 6c . This finding is consistent with reports that human ProTa has three over-lapping caspase-3 cleavage sites , 94DDED97 , 95DEDD98 , and 97DDVD101,20,21 immediately upstream of the NLS moiety in its C-terminus , and that this fragment lacks an NLS moiety KKQK , which is present in rat ProTa at amino-acid positions 103�106 . To identify the cleavage sites of rat ProTa by active caspase-3 , we performed MALDI-TOF analysis . As shown in Figure 6e , MALDI-TOF analysis revealed that the molecular mass of purified ProTa in naive C6 glioma cells was 12259.99 , which corresponds to N-terminal serine acetylated full-length size Ac2-112 , whereas ProTa-like molecule in apoptogenic staurosporine-treated cells was 10480.39 or 10596.43 , which corresponds to C-terminal truncated ProTa Ac2-97 or Ac2-98 , respectively . Tunicamycin or etoposide treatments also showed similar results data not shown . Next , we tried to characterize the cleavage region of recombinant rat ProTa rrProTa by caspase-3 by use of peptide mass fingerprinting analysis . In this experiment , rrProTa was incubated with or without active rat caspase-3 , followed by a separation with SDS-PAGE , in-gel digestion of protein bands with trypsin and MALDI-TOF analysis Figure 6f . In the absence of incubation of active rat capase-3 blue peaks , two peaks with molecular mass of 1131.15 and 1479.66 were identified as a.a.22�31 and a.a.91�103 peptides , respectively . However , in its presence black peaks , there were new peaks with 792.47 and 907.41 , corresponding to a.a.91�97 and a.a.91�98 peptides , respec-tively , but the peak with 1479.66 disappeared . Furthermore , the digestion of synthetic rat ProTa C-terminal 93�112 polypeptide by caspase-3 produced two peaks with molecular mass of 1678.88 and 1794.01 , which correspond to a.a.99� 112 and a.a.98�112 peptides , respectively Figure 6g . All these results indicate that rat ProTa has the two over-lapping cleavage sites by caspase-3 Figure 6d . Accordingly , ProTa likely loses its NLS moiety under apoptotic conditions . This view is supported by the finding that immunoreactive ProTa is no longer localized in the nucleus after treatment of cells with apoptogenic compounds Figure 6a . On the basis of the finding that the ProTa fragment was not released from cells , this C-terminal region appears to be essential for the extracellular release of ProTa . The nuclear protein ProTa currently attracts the interest of investigators in terms of life and death decisions in various cell types . In the nucleus , this protein epigenetically stimulates cell proliferation by binding to histones , 22 p300 histone acetyl-transferase , 23 and CREB-binding protein.24 ProTa also enhances estrogen receptor transcriptional activity by binding to its repressor , 25 and binds to Keap1 to release Nrf2 , which in turn upregulates various kinds of anti-oxidant enzymes important for survival.26 Under the apoptotic conditions , it inhibits apoptosome formation.4 Most recently , we discovered this protein as an anti-necrosis factor in the CM of cultured cortical neurons under serum-free starving conditions causing necrosis.5 Extracellular ProTa completely inhibits neuronal necrosis , but causes apoptosis in a different manner in cultured neurons.27�29 However , after stroke , endogenous neurotrophins , such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor BDNF or erythropoietin , have been found to inhibit the apoptosis induced by exogenously administered ProTa.6 In the retinal ischemia model , the ischemic stress depletes ProTa from the retinal cells , and the intravitreous pretreat-ments with anti-ProTa IgG or antisense oligodeoxynucleotide against ProTa deteriorated the ischemic damage.7 Therefore , it is evident that ProTa is extracellularly released from nuclei on ischemic stress , and that it exerts endogenous neuro-protective functions . Polypeptide secretion has largely been defined as a process of exocytosis through the fusion of vesicles contain-ing bioactive substances to the plasma membrane . In the representative vesicular secretion pathway , polypeptides that possess a signal peptide sequence in their N-terminal region are sorted to the ER-Golgi system to be processed by exocytosis.30,31 However , several polypeptides possess extracellular functions despite lacking a signal sequence . The extracellular release of such polypeptides has to proceed through ER-Golgi-independent or non-vesicular so-called non-classical routes . It should be noted that these poly-peptides showing non-classical extracellular release in general have significant functions in the life and death decisions of cells , as seen in the cases with angiogenic growth factors , inflammatory cytokines , extracellular matrix growth factors , viral proteins , and parasite surface pro-teins.32,33 Unlike vesicular release , this type of release is caused by non-physiological stressful stimuli , which may cause rapid cell death . A series of pioneering studies by Maciag and his coworkers led to the hypothesis that S100A13 has key functions in the so-called non-classical extracellular release.8 S100A13 has two EF-hand Ca2 ? -binding motifs and belongs to a member of the S100 family.15�17 It has been reported that S100A13 is involved in the non-classical extracellular release of target molecules containing fibroblast growth factor-1 FGF-1 and interleukin-1a.9�11,19,34,35 In this study , we successfully showed that ProTa is another example of stress-induced non-vesicular extracellular release , using S100A13 , a cargo molecule . Furthermore , we revealed that the C-terminal regions of ProTa and S100A13 are essential for their interaction , which precedes extracellular release of both proteins , and that caspase-3 cleaves off C-terminal regions of ProTa . Thus , the non-vesicular extracellular release of ProTa has a unique feature that it is does not occur under the condition of apoptosis . The unique point in this study is observed in the fact that ProTa is strictly localized in the nucleus in neurons , astrocytes , and C6 glioma cells . The mechanism underlying ischemic stress-induced extracellular release of ProTa com-prises a two-tier export system from the nucleus to the cytosol , and from the cytosol to outside the cell . As mentioned above , the nuclear export of ProTa is attributed to ischemia-induced ATP loss , which impairs the importin-NLS mecha-nism . As this nuclear export was not affected by leptomycin B , the serum-deprivation stress-induced drastic decrease in nuclear levels of ProTa is likely to be due to passive diffusion . Interestingly , once ProTa is exported from the nucleus , it is disappeared without remaining in the cytosol . In other words , nuclear export is the rate-limiting step for non-vesicular and extracellular release of ProTa . The stress-induced extracellular release of ProTa was impaired by the addition of cytosolic or extracellular Ca2 ? -chelating agents . The interaction between ProTa and S100A13 was Ca2 ? concentration dependent in the range 0.1�200 mM , which corresponds to the cellular levels between resting and stimulated conditions . The Ca2 ? dependency seems to be attributed to the facts that both S100A13 and ProTa are Ca2 ? -binding proteins.15�17,36 On the basis of the observation that serum-deprivation stress causes the activation of voltage-dependent N-type Ca2 ? channel , which is involved in the non-classical release of FGF-1 and S100A13,34,35 ischemic stress-induced Ca2 ? influx may underlie the non-vesicular ProTa release as the second step after ATP loss-dependent nuclear release . Neurons die by necrosis in the low density of culture under the serum-starved condition , but their survival activity increases as the cell density goes . We identified ProTa as the important molecule , which is released in the CM of serum-starved culture of neurons , and suppresses the necrosis through a recovery of glucose transport and ATP supply.5,37 After longer culture with ProTa , however , we found that neurons die by apoptosis through activation of caspase-3.5 As caspase-3 is known to cleave poly- [ ADP-ribose ] polymerase , which consumes abundant ATP molecule for the restoration from stress-induced damage of DNA , 38 this machinery seems to have some functions in suppression of rapid necrosis by stress.29 As the concomitant addition of anti-apoptotic neurotrphins with ProTa completely inhibits the cell death , the physiological meaning of ProTa action would be specu-lated as a conversion of uncontrollable cell death necrosis to controllable apoptosis . Indeed , this speculation was con-firmed by in vivo study , in which exogenous ProTa inhibited both necrosis and apoptosis of retinal cells after ischemia , but the further treatment with anti-BDNF antibody disclosed the apoptosis induction by ProTa.7 It should be noted that ProTa in the cytosol inhibits apoptosis through an inhibition of apoptosome formation in non-neuronal HeLa cells.4 Furthermore , there is a report that ProTa is released from the nuclei when the NLS is cleaved off by caspase-3.20,21 This study clearly showed that the C-terminal region of ProTa including NLS is cleaved in culture by the apoptosis-induced compound , and in cell-free digestion of recombinant ProTa by active caspase-3 Figure 6d�g . As ProTa devoid of C-terminal region a.a.98 or 99�112 is conceived to lose the activity of interaction with S100A13 Figure 4d , it will remain in the cytosol without extracellular release . All these findings enable us to speculate that ProTa extracellularly released on the necrosis condition inhibits neuronal necrosis in an autocrine or paracrine manner , whereas cytosolic ProTa redistributed from the nuclei on the apoptotic condition may have an anti-apoptotic self-defensive function . It is well known that several endogenous molecules are released in response to injury , infection , or other inflamma-tory stimuli , and initiate inflammatory responses . These molecules are so-called damage-associated molecular patterns DAMPs and or alarmins.39,40 Although DAMPs have intranuclear and or intracellular functions under normal conditions , they have extracellular effects under pathological conditions . High-mobility group box1 HMGB1 , a representative DAMP molecule , has similar characteristics to ProTa . HMGB1 , a nuclear protein , is released by necrotic stress , but not by apoptosis , as seen for ProTa . However , it causes cell damaging or inflammatory actions . Although this release is reported to occur through passive diffusion through necrosis-induced membrane disruption , detailed character-ization of the mechanism is required . It is interesting to propose that ProTa is a novel type of DAMP bearing cell-defensive functions in brain . In conclusion , we showed that the nuclear protein ProTa is extracellularly released from neurons , astrocytes , and C6 glioma cells on ischemic stress in a non-vesicular manner . The initial step of this release is nuclear release of ProTa owing to the stress-induced ATP loss . Non-vesicular extra-cellular release of ProTa is dependent on a Ca2 ? -sensitive interaction with S100A13 . We also showed that ProTa loses the ability to undergo extracellular release under apoptotic conditions , owing to loss of its interaction with S100A13 , a cargo molecule .

20689556	www.nature.com cdd Wild-type p53 wt-p53 is a transcription factor that promotes cell cycle arrest , DNA repair , cellular senescence and apoptosis1,2 in response to stress stimuli . About 50 % of human cancers have lost functional p53 mostly because of the mutations at the DNA-binding domain of p53.3 p53 mutants mutp53 are being overexpressed and accumu-lated to very high levels in cancer cells 4 however , they are unable to recognize wt-p53 DNA-binding sites causing a loss of p53 tumor suppressor function . Furthermore , mutp53 acts as a dominant negative through hetero-oligo-merization , with wt-p53 preventing its tumor suppressor activity.5 In addition , the most commonly occurring p53 core mutants display a gain of oncogenic function GOF 4 actively promoting tumor progression . One of the major mechanisms underlying mutp53 GOF is its ability to regulate a large number of specific target genes.6 Although the idea of an oncogenic activity of mutp53 is widely acknowledged , the specific mechanisms underlying it remain to be fully elucidated . Although prostate cancer is the most commonly diagnosed type of cancer in men , so far no cure is available for patients with advanced disease . In prostate cancer , mutations in the p53 tumor suppressor gene are usually associated with poor prognosis . The reported frequency of p53 alterations in primary prostate cancer varies between 0 and 80 % .7 Never-theless , it is widely accepted that p53 mutations are common in advanced prostate cancer and correlate with metastasis and recurrence.8 One major drawback in investigating prostate cancer is the fact that commonly used prostate carcinoma cell lines are originated from metastatic lesions and contain multiple genetic alterations . On such a background , it is difficult to investigate a specific tumor suppressor or an oncogene with respect to cancerous processes . To be able to evaluate the authentic role of p53 in prostate carcinogenesis , we assessed the effect of p53 mutation in EP156T-immortalized prostate epithelial cells.9 Using this immortalized model , we could manipulate the cells in a controlled way and investigate individual lines with specific genetic alterations . The proli-ferative behavior of immortalized cells expressing either wt , inactivated or mutated p53 was analyzed , and genomic profiling was performed . We identified cell-cycle-associated M-phase genes upregulated when p53 is inactivated or mutated , suggesting that mutp53 exerts a dominant-negative inactivation of wt-p53 , which accelerates cell cycle progres-sion . Furthermore , we found a unique group of genes implicated in both development and cancer progression , whose expression was increased only in cells harboring mutp53 , suggesting a GOF activity of mutp53 . We focused on elucidating the regulation of one gene from this list , the Twist1 , which is an important regulator of epithelial�mesenchymal transition EMT . The increase in Twist1 expression was correlated with characteristic features of EMT observed in mutp53-expressing cells . Altogether , our data suggest that mutp53 supports malignancy by accelerating cellular proli-feration through a dominant-negative mechanism , and by inducing the EMT process through its GOF activity . Results Inactivation of wt-p53 in EP156T cells by GSE56 or p53R175H mutant overexpression confers cells with signi-ficant proliferation advantages . hTERT-immortalized prostate epithelial EP156T cells retained intact wt-p53 activity.9 The p53R175H mutation is commonly found in cancer cells including prostate cancer , 10 and it is known to confer an oncogenic GOF activity on a background of wt-p53.4 To investigate the effect of p53 mutation , EP156T cells at passage 25 were infected with a recombinant retrovirus encoding with either p53R175H mutant M cells , dominant-negative p53 peptide GSE56 G cells or control vector C cells Figure 1 . The GSE56 served as a control for mutp53 GOF . To obtain a complete picture , we investigated the effect of the above alterations on the development of oncogenic features at several points along the immortali-zation process . A number indicating the approximate number of passages �3 at which the specific sample was attached to sample labels was also investigated . C40 , G40 and M40 cells were treated for 6 h and for 16 h with DNA-damaging agent doxorubicin . Then , p53 protein stabilization and mRNA levels of p53 target genes were examined to test whether wt-p53 activity was compromised in GSE56-and mutp53-expressing cells . p53 protein stabiliza-tion and efficient upregulation in the expression of p21waf1 and PUMA mRNA upon doxorubicin were observed in C40 cells Figure 1a . In G40 and M40 cells , p53 protein levels were very high both in the treated and in the non-treated samples in agreement with the expected accumulation of inactive wt-p53 upon infection with GSE56 in G cells and accumulation of mutp53 upon p53R175H overexpression in M cells . In accordance with this , induction of p21waf1 and PUMA transcription was strongly attenuated in both G40 and M40 cells at the 6-h time point . Notably , in M40 cells there was an upregulation in the mRNA levels of p21waf1 and PUMA after 16 h of treatment , although the mRNA levels were still significantly lower than that in the C40 cells . Thus , mutp53 overexpression only partially interferes with wt-p53 function in response to DNA damage . To evaluate whether the partial dominant-negative effect detected in EP156T cells can be observed in an additional cellular system , we used hTERT-immortalized primary lung fibroblasts WI-3811 infected with GSE56 or p53R175H . A similar pattern was evident Figure 1b confirming partial wt-p53 inactivation by mutp53 . To evaluate the effect of p53 inactivation on cell growth , mean doubling time along 400 days in vitro was calculated for each culture . This analysis indicated that G and M cells were proliferating more rapidly than C cells Figure 1c . To reinforce this observation , we compared colony-forming efficiencies of the three cell lines . C70 , G70 and M70 cells were seeded at clonal density and the number of colonies was counted after 2 weeks of incubation . Both G70 and M70 lines exhibited a higher colony-forming efficiency , as shown by their colonies number and size distribution when compared with C70 cells , which barely induced any colonies Figure 1d . These data suggest that the increase in the proliferation rate in G and M lines results mostly from p53 inactivation rather than a specific GOF activity . Dominant-negative inactivation of wt-p53 versus GOF of p53R175H effects on gene expression . Next , we wished to assess the effect of mutp53 on gene expression . Samples of each of the three lines were subjected to genomic profiling by cDNA microarray in 10-passage intervals Figure 2a . First , we evaluated the dominant-negative effect of wt-p53 inactivation . To this end , GSE56 upregulated genes were determined . This analysis yielded a list of 303 upregulated genes Supplementary Table S1 that were also upregulated , although to a slightly lower extent in the M line . Functional annotation analysis revealed that this list was enriched with genes that belong to the �cell cycle phase� Supplementary Table S2 . Their levels in the different samples are illustrated in a �heat map� Figure 2b showing that the onset of this �cell cycle phase� gene expression in both G and M lines occurs at passage 40 , which is 30 passages earlier than that in the C line . We validated this expression pattern by measuring the mRNA levels of AURKA , BIRC5 and CDC20 , as represen-tative genes , using quantitative real-time PCR QRT-PCR Figure 2c , upper panel . Western blotting for CDC20 was used for protein confirmation Figure 2c , lower panel . Notably , the increase in cell proliferation rate and the higher colony-forming efficiency of G and M lines compared with the C line Figure 1b and c are consistent with higher levels of �cell cycle phase� gene expression . To evaluate the mutp53 GOF effect , we isolated a mutp53-specific gene expression profile Supplementary Table S3 as described in the Materials and methods section . The most significant enrichment was found for �multicellular organismal development� Figure 2b . This pattern was validated by QRT-PCR for GREM1 , SLITRK5 and Twist1 as representatives Figure 2c , middle panel . Western blotting analysis for SLITRK5 and Twist1 confirmed QRT-PCR observations Figure 2c , lower panel . Importantly , knocking down endo-genous wt-p53 by shp53 Supplementary Figure S1A did not induce the expression of GREM1 , SLITRK5 or Twist1 as was in the case of mutp53 overexpression Supplementary Figure S1B , supporting the notion that the induction of these genes in the M line was due to mutp53 GOF mechanism and not through wt-p53 inactivation . Altogether , our results show a specific expression profile for the dominant-negative effect , which is correlated with proliferation and a distinct expression profile specific for mutp53 GOF , which is connected to development . Mutp53 specifically elevates Twist1 expression . Genes that normally function in developmental processes are often deregulated in cancer . Twist1 that appeared in our list of mutp53 upregulated genes is involved in tumor metastasis through an induction of EMT.12 In prostate cancer , strong nuclear Twist1 staining correlates with high Gleason score and metastasis.13,14 Thus , we decided to investigate whether a molecular cross-talk exists between mutp53 and Twist1 expression in M cells . Interestingly , Twist1 upregulation was initially evident at passage 40 , which is 15 passages after p53R175H was introduced to the cells . To validate that Twist1 upregulation in M cells is specifically dependent on the expression of mutp53 , p53R175H-expressing cells were stably infected with shp53 M60-p53i and the levels of Twist1 were determined . Wt-p53-expressing cells C60 were also infected with shp53 C60-p53i and were used as a control . Notably , immediately after the knock down , although mutp53 levels were about fourfold lower in cells infected with shp53 as compared with cells infected with control vector , the levels of Twist1 remained high not shown . However , three passages after shp53 introduction , QRT-PCR and western blotting indicated that Twist1 was efficiently down-regulated in M cells Figure 3a . To examine whether Twist1 regulation by mutp53 is a general phenomenon , endogenous mutp53 carrying DU145 cells were stably infected with shp53 and Twist1 expression was tested . Figure 3b shows a decrease in Twist1 levels following mutp53 knockdown in DU145 . Furthermore , to evaluate whether Twist1 mRNA levels were higher in clinical progression samples in prostate cancer , we performed an in silico comparative analysis by searching ONCOMINE microarray database . This analysis indicated that Twist1 mRNA levels were increased in metastatic prostate cancer samples as compared with normal and localized cancer samples Figure 3c . To test whether mutp53 may also induce Twist1 expression in additional cellular systems , we infected the immortalized WI-38 lung fibroblasts with either p53R175H or p53R273H mutants or with shp53 as a control for the loss of wt-p53 function . Both p53R175H and p53R273H mutants overexpres-sion resulted in the upregulation of Twist1 mRNA in WI-38 cells Figure 3d , further supporting our original observation that mutp53 elevates Twist1 mRNA expression levels . Finally , we measured the expression levels of Twist1 in a subset of human lung cancer samples whose p53 status was predefined . Judged by QRT-PCR , it appears that a higher proportion of samples with mutp53 expressed high levels of Twist1 gene 4 8 compared to samples with wt-p53 2 13 Figure 3e . Thus , mutp53 elevates Twist1 expression levels in prostate epithelial cells , prostate cancer cell line , fibroblasts and lung tumors by a specific GOF mechanism . The prostate epithelial p53R175H-expressing cells display characteristic features of EMT . As high Twist1 expression in tumors was shown to induce EMT , 12 it was important to evaluate whether mutp53-expressing cells , which also express high levels of Twist1 , display characteristic features of EMT . To this end , we tested the mRNA levels of EMT markers in our immortalized cultures . As Figure 4a shows , M cells that highly express Twist1 indeed showed an increased level of EMT markers fibronectin1 , MMP3 and MMP9 . On the other hand , the levels of epithelial markers E-cadherin , desmoplakin , DSC3 and DNp63 were signi-ficantly reduced in M cells as compared with C and G cells Figure 4a . Furthermore , immunofluorescent staining showed weaker intensity for E-cadherin and much stronger intensity for fibronectin1 in M cells as compared with C and G cells Figure 4b . We further tested whether M cells also show more potent invasive capabilities . Indeed , M80 cells performed approximately two times better than C80 and G80 cells in an in vitro invasion assay Figure 4c . Acquisition of invasive properties in tumors usually correlates with the loss of normal tissue architecture . As Twist1 is a known regulator of morphogenesis , we utilized a three-dimensional matrigel assay of glandular morphogenesis15 to compare C , G and M cells . In our previous study , EP156T as well as prostate primary epithelial cells seeded in Matrigel-coated wells , created three-dimensional spheroid structures resembling glandular buds and indicative of intact morphogenesis.9 When C80 , G80 and M80 cells were seeded on the Matrigel , all three cultures were able to create spheroids that look very similar and closely resemble spheroids created by normal prostate epithelial cells data not shown . This indicates normal pattern of morphogenesis in all three cultures . Overexpression of oncogenes often disrupts this normal morphogenesis process.16 To test whether there will be any difference in glandular morphogenesis of EP156T cultures in the presence of oncogenic stimulation , we introduced the H-RasV12 oncogene into C80 , G80 and M80 cells , and then tested their ability to create spheroids . Figure 4d shows that while C80-RasV12 and G80-RasV12 formed well-ordered spheroids in three-dimensional cultures , M80-RasV12 cells created unordered structures with extensions and multiple acini indicative of disruption of normal morphogenesis . Over-expression of H-RasV12 was validated by western blotting Figure 4d . Twist1 expression pattern was not altered by H-RasV12 . Collectively , these data suggest that M cells display characteristic features of EMT , enhanced invasive properties in vitro and a defect in normal pattern of morphogenesis . Twist1 activation by mutp53 is mediated through attenuation of epigenetic repression . Our next experi - ment aimed to elucidate the mechanism responsible for Twist1 upregulation in M cells . To test whether mutp53 induces transcriptional activation of Twist1 promoter , we first performed a reporter gene assay . A 1.3-kb DNA fragment upstream of the transcription start site of human Twist1 gene fused to luciferase reporter gene was used . Reporter assays were performed in C60 and M60 cells infected with shp53 or with short hairpin control coni . As Figure 5a shows , Twist1 promoter reporter was activated to similar levels in all of the examined cell lines . p21waf1 promoter used as a control showed the highest levels of activity in wt-p53-expressing C60-coni cells as expected Figure 5a . This implies that mutp53-mediated upregulation of Twist1 could be achieved through genomic modifications , which are not detected using artificial promoter . Changes in epigenetic repression are involved in both the normal development and cancer.17 As Twist1 was not expressed in cultured prostate epithelial cells , we hypothe-sized that it could be silenced by an epigenetic mechanism and that mutp53 introduction disrupts this repression leading to Twist1 expression . To test this possibility , we treated the cells with DNA methylation inhibitor 5-azacytidine in combina-tion with histone deacetylase inhibitor , trichostatin A. Figure 5b shows that this treatment induced a significant upregulation in Twist1 mRNA levels in C cells . Importantly , no effect was observed following the treatment in the M line , suggesting that epigenetic modifications have an important role in Twist1 upregulation by mutp53 . To test whether the Twist1 promoter is less methylated in M cells , we performed methylated DNA immunoprecipitation . However , no signifi-cant difference in Twist1 promoter methylation was noticed comparing M and C cells data not shown . Thus , increased Twist1 levels following 5-azacytidine and trichostatin A treatment might be through activation of other targets affecting Twist1 expression . To further unravel the mecha-nism of Twist1 activation in M cells , we re-evaluated our microarray expression data , searching for genes whose expression would show either direct or inverse correlation with Twist1 expression . We assumed that such genes might be functioning as mediators of epigenetic regulation of Twist1 expression . Interestingly , the BMI-1 gene , a component of the polycomb repression complex involved in trimethylation of histone H3 at lysine 27 H3K27me3 , was one of the genes whose expression showed an inverse correlation to Twist1 expression . We validated mutp53-dependent expression pattern of BMI-1 by QRT-PCR and indeed found that BMI-1 was downregulated in M cells Figure 5c . As BMI-1 is involved in the maintenance of H3K27me3 epigenetic repression mark , especially relevant for developmental genes , 18 we examined the possibility of differential H3K27me3 levels in the Twist1 promoter of Twist1-expres-sing versus Twist1-non-expressing cells . Therefore , we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation ChIP using an antibody to H3K27me3 followed by QRT-PCR for Twist1 promoter region , 40-bp upstream to transcription start site in the different cell lines . Indeed , lower levels of H3K27me3 on Twist1 promoter in M cells were observed Figure 5d . Importantly , there was a significant increase in H3K27me3 following knock down of p53R175H by shRNA in M cells Figure 5d . This is consistent with BMI-1 upregulation in the same sample Figure 5c . Therefore , it was of interest to examine whether BMI-1 overexpression in M cells would directly methylate Twist1 promoter and reduce Twist1 levels . To explore this possibility , M80 cells were stably infected with BMI-1 Figure 5e . QRT-PCR indicated that BMI-1 over-expression resulted in a reduction of Twist1 expression Figure 5e . Furthermore , ChIP indicated that BMI-1 over-expression remarkably elevated the level of H3K27me3 on Twist1 promoter Figure 5f . Thus , BMI-1 downmodulation in M cells is identified as a key factor for Twist1 induction by mutp53 . Taken together , our results suggest that mutp53-dependent upregulation of Twist1 is mediated through a reduction of H3K27me3 repression mark on Twist1 promoter owing to BMI-1 downregulation by p53R175H . GOF of mutp53 was previously shown to be attributable to p63 inhibition by mutp53.19,20 Furthermore , p63 has an essential role in the biology of epithelial tissues.21 Therefore , we decided to test whether p63 inhibition by mutp53 can account for mutp53 GOF in Twist1 upregulation and EMT in EP156T cells . To this end , C60 cells were infected with shp63 . p63 downregulation following shp63 infection was validated by QRT-PCR and western blotting Supplementary Figure S2A . However , this treatment did not result in either BMI-1 downregulation or Twist1 induction Supplementary Figure S2B . Thus , p63 inhibition most likely is not responsible for mutp53 GOF in the induction of Twist1 expression and EMT in EP156T cells . Discussion In this study , we aimed to differentiate between the dominant-negative inactivation of the wt-p53 by the mutp53 and mutp53 GOF activity . The data presented indicate that while dominant-negative inactivation of wt-p53 results in the upregulation of genes involved in cell cycle progression and cell growth , the GOF effect is reflected in the upregulation of development-associated genes and EMT phenotype . This phenotype is likely achieved by the upregulation of EMT-inducing transcription factor Twist1 by the p53R175H . Although the GOF effect of mutp53 on proliferation and inva-sion was shown previously , 22 this is the first report showing the connection between p53 mutation and EMT process , including a remarkable increase in Twist1 expression . Our results suggest that both inactivation of p53 by GSE56 and p53R175H mutant overexpression deregulate p53 pathway to induce the expression of genes involved in cell cycle progression . However , there was higher expression of cell cycle genes in cells with GSE56 than in cells with p53R175H . This might indicate that GSE56 imposes a stronger dominant-negative effect on wt-p53 than p53R175H does . This notion is supported by the results obtained following DNA damage Figure 1a showing higher expression of p53 target genes in M cells than in G cells . The observation that shp53-bearing WI-38 cells express higher levels of Twist1 than wt-p53-bearing counterparts Figure 3d suggests that wt-p53 might inhibit Twist1 . Notably , mutp53-expressing WI-38 cells showed even higher levels of Twist1 expression , indicating that mutp53 activates Twist1 expression in an independent manner and not through wt-p53 inactivation . Several reports show mutp53 GOF , where mutp53 is able to upregulate gene expression through binding the promoters of specific genes.23 Reporter gene assay including 1.3-kb Twist1 promoter indicated similar level of reporter activation in Twist1-expressing M cells and in Twist1-non-expressing cells , and we concluded that mutp53 regulates Twist1 expression by a different mechanism . Yet , it can not be excluded that other than 1.3-kb upstream sequences might be important for the regulation of Twist1 expression by mutp53 in addition to epigenetic regulation . The BMI-1 component of the polycomb repression complex was identified as a mutp53-repressed gene . Furthermore , reduced levels of H3K27me3 were found at the Twist1 promoter region in mutp53 cells . Overexpression of BMI-1 in mutp53 cells induced elevation of H3K27me3 in Twist1 promoter and a reduction of Twist1 expression was observed . Low BMI-1 expression levels in M cells appear controversial because BMI-1 is broadly accepted as an oncogene . Nevertheless , a recent report identified BMI-1 expression as a favorable prognostic factor in breast cancer patients.24 An additional study reported that BMI-1 overexpression correlated with a good outcome in breast cancer and p53 mutation correlated with low BMI-1 levels.25 These studies support our conclusion that mutp53 downregulates BMI-1 expression levels . Prostate cancer at advanced stage , which is closely associated with p53 mutation , is virtually incurable . Our data suggest that mutp53 protein induces Twist1 expression in epithelial cells in which otherwise Twist1 , a known inducer of EMT , is not detectable . Twist1 was previously suggested as a good candidate for targeted therapy of prostate cancer patients.14 Our findings further support this approach and suggest that targeting mutp53 may deplete Twist1 levels and reduce the invasiveness of cancer cells . Cell cultures . EP156T cells and WI-38 cells were maintained as described.9,11 The DU145 cells and the ecotropic retrovirus-producing Phoenix cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection ATCC , Manassas , VA , USA and cultured according to ATCC�s instruction . The infection procedures using ecotropic Phoenix-packaging cells were described in Milyavsky et al.11 Retroviral constructs . The pRetroSuper-p53 shRNA-Blast , the pRetroSuper-shmNOXA-Blast control for shRNA and the pBabe-H-RasV12-Hygro constructs were kindly provided by Dr. Doron Ginsberg Bar-Ilan University , Ramat-Gan , Israel . The PLXSN-GSE56-Neo and PLXSN-p53R175H-Neo vectors were generated in our laboratory by Dr Michael Milyavsky et al.11 The retroviral BMI-1 overexpression construct pBabe-puro-BMI-1 was generously provided by Dr Goberdhan Dimri . The BMI-1 insert was subcloned from this vector into pBabe-Hygro . The p63 shRNA construct for total p63 knockdown pSuper-Puro-totp63 was obtained from Dr Moshe Oren and then subcloned into the retroviral pRetroSuper-Hygro vector . Western blotting analysis . For western blotting , total cell extracts were fractionated by gel electrophoresis and proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes . The following primary antibodies were used rabbit polyclonal anti-p53 produced in our laboratory , anti-CDC-20 sc-8358 Santa Cruz , Santa Cruz , CA , USA , anti-Twist Twist2C1a , sc-81417 Santa Cruz , anti-p63 4A4 , sc-8431 Santa Cruz , anti-SLITRK5 AB67309 Abcam , Cambridge , MA , USA and anti-GAPDH MAB374 Biotest the protein�antibody complexes were detected by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies followed by the ECL western blotting detection reagents Amersham , Buckinghamshire , UK . cDNA microarrays . cDNA microarrays were performed using the GeneChip Human Genome U133A 2.0 Array Affymetrix , Santa Clara , CA , USA . The DNA for the microarrays was prepared according to the manufacturer�s instructions . Microarray data analysis . To evaluate the dominant-negative effect of wt-p53 inactivation , we compared the gene expression patterns of the G line with the control C line . We searched for genes that were at least 1.6-fold upregulated in the G line at each time point i.e . C30�G30 , C40�G40 , etc. . To find genes that were stably upregulated in G cells , only the genes that were altered at least in three sequential time points were selected . This analysis yielded a list of 303 upregulated genes Supplementary Table S1 . These genes were upregulated to a slightly lower extent in the M line as well . The functional annotations of the 303 gene list were examined using �gene ontology�.26 Consequently , the gene ontology of the �cell cycle phase� showed the most significant enrichment of 75 genes P-value ? 2.2 10 60 as calculated by the DAVID database27 see Supplementary Table S2 . To evaluate the GOF effect , the gene expression patterns of the M line were compared with those of the control C line and only the genes that were at least 1.6-fold upregulated at three sequential time points were chosen for further analysis . From those genes we subtracted all genes that were also upregulated in the G line . The upregulation of the remaining 37 genes Supplementary Table S3 in the M line is not owing to dominant-negative effect , but rather owing to mutp53 GOF activities . Thus , we performed a search for functional annotations within this list . The most significant enrichment of 15 genes was for �multicellular organismal development� with a P-value of 7.4 10 5 see Supplementary Table S4 . Isolation of total RNA . Total RNA for QRT-PCR was isolated using NucleoSpin RNA extract kit Macherey-Nagel , Duren , Germany according to the manufacturer�s protocol . Quantitative real-time PCR .

20798690	Diabetes mellitus arises from the inability of the pancreatic b-cells to preserve metabolic homeostasis by the regulated secretion of insulin . The two main forms of diabetes are type 1 T1D and type 2 T2D .1 T1D is primarily caused by an autoimmune attack leading to b-cell destruction and insulin deficiency . T2D is triggered by the combination of insulino-resistance and impaired b-cell function and survival , mostly secondary to metabolic factors through a process referred to as glucolipotoxicity.1 Both pathologies are characterized by decreased b-cell mass secondary to apoptosis b-cell loss is more marked in T1D and is a relative late event in T2D , probably contributing to secondary failure of oral therapies.1 The mitochondrial intrinsic pathway of apoptosis controlled by the B-cell lymphoma 2 Bcl-2 protein family2 plays a major role in pancreatic b-cell death in both T1D and T2D.3 The Bcl-2 protein family can be divided into three groups , the antiapoptotic proteins Bcl-2 , B-cell lymphoma-extra large Bcl-XL , Bcl-w , myeloid cell leukemia sequence 1 Mcl-1 and A1 , the multi-domain pro-apoptotic proteins Bcl2-associated X protein Bax , Bcl-2 homologous antagonist killer Bak and Bok and the pro-apoptotic BH3-only proteins including Bim , Bid , neuronal death protein 5 DP5 , also known as Harakiri Hrk , Puma , Bad and Noxa . Upon death stimulus , Bax translocates from the cytosol to the mitochondria and oligomerizes with Bak , resulting in mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization MOMP . This allows proteins located in the mitochondrial intermembrane space , such as cytochrome c , to be released in the cytosol , in which they associate with cytosolic proteins to activate downstream executioner caspases resulting in apoptosis.4 The Bax Bak activation is regulated by a delicate equilibrium between antiapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins and pro-apoptotic BH3-only proteins . Among the antiapoptotic proteins , overexpression of Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL have been shown to prevent b-cell apoptosis in a variety of models , 5�7 but they may hamper b-cell function.7 The molecular role of Mcl-1 in b-cells remains to be characterized . Mcl-1 is structurally unique among the Bcl-2 family it contains two PEST sequences polypeptide sequences enriched in proline P , glutamic acid E , serine S and threonine T , which favor Mcl-1 degradation , thereby reducing its half-life . Mcl-1 activity is also regulated by phosphorylation by the c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase JNK and extracellular signal-regulated kinase ERK pathways in response to a variety of cell stimuli.8 This highly regulated state suggests that Mcl-1 , rather than other Bcl-2 pro-survival proteins , is an early pivotal protein in the regulation of cell survival in response to extracellular signals . Pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin 1 beta IL-1b , tumor necrosis factor alpha TNF-a and interferon gamma IFN-g and high concentrations of saturated free fatty acids FFAs such as palmitate are candidate mediators of beta cell apoptosis in T1D and T2D , respectively.1 In this study , we investigated the effect of cytokines , FFAs and chemical endoplasmic reticulum ER stressors on Mcl-1 expression and , using both small interference RNA siRNA strategy and adenoviral-mediated Mcl-1 overexpression , explored the role of Mcl-1 in b-cell function and survival . The data obtained indicate that Mcl-1 is a key antiapoptotic protein in b-cells , which is rapidly degraded in response to pro-apoptotic stimuli , leading to increased Bax translocation to the mitochondria , cytochrome c release , cleavage of executioner caspase-3 and apoptosis in b-cells . These novel observations place Mcl-1 as key determinant of b-cell fate during severe stress . Results Pro-inflammatory cytokines and palmitate decrease Mcl-1 expression in pancreatic b-cells . To evaluate the effect of pro-inflammatory cytokines on Mcl-1 expression , INS-1E cells were treated for 24 h with IL-1b , TNF-a and IFN-g , alone or in combination , as indicated Figure 1a . Western blot analysis revealed the presence of a doublet of Mcl-1 isoforms around 40 42lkDa as described previously.9 IL-1b alone decreased Mcl-1 expression by 30 % . IFN-g and TNF-a had no effect individually , but induced a 40 % decrease in Mcl-1 expression when combined . IFN-g also potentialized the effect of IL-1b , leading to a 60 % reduction of Mcl-1 expression for quantification see Supplementary data Supplementary Figure S1a . We have previously shown that cytokines induce ER stress in b-cells.10 To test whether ER stress contributes to Mcl-1 decrease , INS-1E cells were exposed to the ER stressors thapsigargin , cyclo-piazonic acid CPA and tunicamycin for 15 h , resulting in a similar 40�60 % decrease in Mcl-1 expression Figure 1b and Supplementary Figure S1b . Salubrinal , a selective inhibitor of the cellular phosphatase complex that dephosphorylates the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 subunit alpha eIF2a 11 also significantly decreased Mcl-1 expression , although by 25 % only Figure 1b and Supplementary Figure S1b . INS-1E cells were also incubated for 15 h in the presence of the FFA oleate and the saturated FFA palmitate , the latter a known b-cell death effector.12,13 Palmitate , but not oleate , decreased Mcl-1 expression by 50 % Figure 1c and Supplementary Figure S1b . Similar to what we observed in INS-1E cells , Mcl-1 expression was decreased in primary rat islets treated for 48 h with TNF-a ? IFN-g or IL-1b ? IFN-g , or for 24 h with thapsigargin , CPA or palmitate Figure 1d . Time-course experiments of thapsigargin or IL-1b ? IFN-g treatment indicated that Mcl-1 protein expression is rapidly decreased after 2 and 4 h of thapsigargin or IL-1b ? IFN-g treatment , respectively as compared with the two other major antiapoptotic proteins , Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL , whose expressions were decreased only after 15 and 24 h of treatment with thapsigargin or IL-1b ? IFN-g , respectively Figure 1e�f . On the other hand , Mcl-1 mRNA expression was upregulated by cytokines , thapsigargin and palmitate , indicating that the Mcl-1 protein decrease is a post-transcriptional event Figure 2a . Mcl-1 is constitutively targeted for degradation by the proteasome.8 INS-1E cells treated with the proteosomal inhibitor MG-132 displayed increased basal Mcl-1 expression and the inhibitor prevented IL-1b ? IFN-g - , TNF-a ? IFN-g - , thapsigargin-and palmitate-induced Mcl-1 degradation Figure 2b and Supplementary Figure S1c , indicating that proteosomal degradation is involved in Mcl-1 down-regulation . Cytokine-induced nitric oxide NO production is instrumental in cytokine-mediated ER stress and b-cell apoptosis , whereas palmitate and thapsigargin do not induce NO production in these cells.10,12 The NO synthase blocker NG-methyl-L-arginine L-NMMA , which fully prevents cytokine-induced NO production in b-cells data not shown Cardozo et al.10 , had no effect on thapsigargin-mediated Mcl-1 decrease , whereas it completely prevented the cytokine effects on Mcl-1 expression Figure 2c . On the other hand , forskolin , an adenylate cyclase activator , which partially protects b-cells against cytokine-and palmitate-induced apoptosis , 14,15 failed to prevent Mcl-1 degradation Figure 2c . INS-1E cells then were transfected with an siRNA targeting the PKR-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase PERK , which is activated upon ER stress and phosphorylates the elongation factor eIF2a , resulting in decreased protein synthesis.11 PERK knockdown using two different siRNAs decreased total PERK expression by 50 % and nearly completely abolished thapsigargin-induced PERK phosphor-ylation Figure 2d . This resulted in a 50 % decrease in basal and stress-induced eIF2a phosphorylation Figure 2d�e and Supplementary Figure S1d . PERK knockdown using siPERK no. 1 prevented thapsigargin - , palmitate-and IL-1 b-induced Mcl-1 downregulation Figure 2e and Supplementary Figure S1d . However , it only partially reversed the inhibitory effects of the cytokine combinations IL-1b ? IFN-g and TNF-a ? IFN-g on Mcl-1 expression Figure 2e and Supplementary Figure S1d . Similar observations were made using siPERK no. 2 Supplementary Figure S1e . JNK has been reported to inactivate Mcl-1,16 and cytokines induce a strong and rapid 1 h JNK phosphorylation in INS-1E cells , 17,18 leading to a peak of c-Jun phosphorylation between 6 and 8 h . We thus exposed INS-1E cells to IL-1b ? IFN-g for 8 h in the presence of the JNK inhibitor peptide JNKi 19 or the chemical JNK inhibitor SP600125.18 Both inhibitors partially prevented the effect of cytokines on Mcl-1 expression , suggesting that JNK is involved in the cytokine-induced Mcl-1 downregulation Figure 2f . Western blot analysis of c-Jun phosphorylation confirmed the efficiency of the inhibi-tors in blocking JNK activity Supplementary Figure S1f . ER stress has been shown to induce a late JNK activation in b-cells 10 however , the JNKi peptide did not prevent the effects of a 15 h exposure to thapsigargin or palmitate on Mcl-1 downregulation . At this time point , JNK inhibition fully prevented the Mcl-1 downregulation induced by IL-1b alone or TNF-a ? IFN-g , and partially prevented the effect of IL-1b ? IFN-g Figure 2g and Supplementary Figure S1c . These data indicate that palmitate and thapsigargin down-regulate Mcl-1 protein through ER stress-mediated inhi-bition of translation , whereas cytokines decrease Mcl-1 through the combined action of translation inhibition and JNK activation . In other cell types , Mcl-1 stability has been shown to be modulated through phosphorylation by the ERK1,2 and the glycogen synthase kinase-3b GSK-3b .8 IL-1b ? IFN-g but not TNF-a ? IFN-g stimulate ERK phosphorylation in INS-1E cells.20,21 The peak of IL-1b ? IFN-g-induced ERK activation occurs after 4�8 h of treatment , which is concomitant with Mcl-1 downregulation . However , blocking IL-1b ? IFN-g-in-duced ERK activity using PD98059 had no effect of Mcl-1 downregulation after 8 h exposure to IL-1b ? IFN-g Supple-mentary Figure S2a . Time-course experiments indicated that INS-1E cells have a high basal GSK-3a , b phosphorylation , suggesting a low GSK-3a , b activity since the phosphorylated form is inactive Supplementary Figure S2b . IL-1b ? IFN-g further stimulated GSK-3a , b phosphorylation after 8 h , and the levels of phospho P -and total GSK-3b were decreased at later time points 16 and 24 h . TNF-a ? IFN-g had no significant effect on P-GSK-3a , b and total GSK-3b Supple-mentary Figure S2c . We next analyzed Mcl-1 protein expression in the presence of two specific GSK-3b inhibitors SB216763 and bromoindirubin-30-oxime BIO 22,23 in INS-1E cells treated or not treated for 8 h with IL-1b ? IFN-g . As a control for the effects of the compounds on GSK-3 activity , we evaluated b-catenin protein expression b-catenin is targeted for proteosomal degradation upon phosphorylation by GSK-3.22 Both SB216763 and BIO increased beta-catenin expression in INS-1E cells , indicating that these compounds efficiently inhibit GSK-3 activity Supplementary Figure S2d . On the other hand , the two inhibitors had no effect on Mcl-1 expression , indicating that GSK-3-mediated Mcl-1 phos-phorylation is not involved in Mcl-1 downregulation in INS-1E cells . Mcl-1 knockdown increases b-cell apoptosis . To elucidate the role of Mcl-1 in b-cells , INS-1E cells were transfected with two siRNAs targeting the rat Mcl-1 . Both siRNAs efficiently decreased Mcl-1 expression Figure 3a . We then studied the effect of Mcl-1 knockdown on b-cell survival . Transfection with Mcl-1 siRNA no. 1 Figure 3b and Supplementary Figure S3a or no. 2 Supplementary Figure S2b significantly increased basal and induced apoptosis in all conditions and at all time points studied in INS-1E cells . Similar data were obtained in fluorescence-activated cell sorting FACS -purified primary b-cells using Mcl-1 siRNA no. 1 Figure 3c and Supplementary Figure S3c . Western blot analysis revealed that knocking down Mcl-1 increased caspase-3 cleavage in control , cytokine - , thapsi-gargin-or palmitate-treated cells Figure 4 .It is noteworthy that Mcl-1 knockdown did not affect Bcl-2 or Bcl-XL expres-sion , and did not modify the effects of cytokines , thapsigargin or palmitate on the expression of the ER stress markers binding immunoglobulin protein BiP also known as glucose regulated protein 78 Grp78 , C EBP homologous protein CHOP Figure 4 and XBP-1s data not shown . Mcl-1 overexpression prevents b-cell apoptosis . We next evaluated whether Mcl-1 overexpression increases b-cell viability following exposure to different stressful agents . For this purpose , an adenovirus overexpressing rat Mcl-1 Ad-Mcl-1 was generated . As compared with non-infected NI cells or cells infected with the control virus encoding luciferase Ad-LUC , INS-1E cells infected with the virus encoding Mcl-1 Ad-Mcl-1 at multiplicity of infections 2 , 5 and 10 displayed dose dependently increased levels of Mcl-1 Figure 5a . Western blot analysis of mitochondrial and cytosolic fractions extracted from INS-1E cells infected with Ad-LUC or Ad-Mcl-1 revealed that the exogenous Mcl-1 is mostly localized in the mitochondrial fraction . The endo-genous Mcl-1 protein was also located in the mitochondrial fraction and absent from the cytosolic fraction . As previously described in other cell types , 2 Bak colocalized with the mitochondrial marker CoxIV , whereas Bax was located in the cytosol Figure 5b . Interestingly , Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL were present in both cytosolic and mitochondrial fractions , in line with previous reports that Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL have a broader cellular distribution as compared with Mcl-1.9 We next evaluated the effect of Mcl-1 overexpression on b-cell survival . As compared with NI or Ad-LUC-infected cells , Ad-Mcl-1-infected INS-1E cells displayed a 50 % reduction in apoptosis following exposure to IL-1b ? IFN-g , TNF-a ? IFN-g , thapsigargin , tunicamycin or palmitate Figure 5c . Similar results were obtained in FACS-purified primary b-cells after treatment with IL-1b ? IFN-g , thapsigargin or palmitate Figure 5d . Time-course experiments revealed that the protection was continuous from 8 to 48 h treatment with IL-1b ? IFN-g Supplementary Figure S3a . Mcl-1 over-expression also reduced by 50 % the caspase-3 cleavage induced by IL-1b ? IFN-g Figure 6a , thapsigargin Figure 6b or palmitate Figure 6c , confirming the anti-apoptotic action of Mcl-1 . Similar to Mcl-1 knockdown , Mcl-1 overexpression had no impact on Bax , Bak , Bcl-2 , Bcl-XL , CHOP and BiP expression Figure 6 . Mcl-1 overexpression prevents Bax translocation to the mitochondria . Mcl-1 has been shown to modulate Bax Bak-mediated MOMP , release of cytochrome c and apoptosis.24 We studied Bax and cytochrome c localization by immuno-staining in INS-1E cells overexpressing Mcl-1 and exposed to IL-1b ? IFN-g . Upon apoptosis determined by nucleus morphology using DNA labeling by Hoechst HO , INS-1E cells displayed a diffuse cytosolic cytochrome c staining , whereas it was discrete and typically mitochondrial in living cells , colocalizing with the mitochondrial marker apoptosis-inducible factor AIF Figure 7a . The mitochondrial morpho-logy , monitored using AIF Figure 7a or ATP synthase Figure 7b , changed drastically between live and apoptotic cells , the latter showing disintegration of the tubular mito-chondrial network and formation of punctiform , fragmented mitochondria . In contrast with the cytochrome c staining , the Bax labeling changed from a homogeneous cytosolic staining in live cells to a discrete punctate staining that colocalized with the mitochondrial marker ATP synthase in apoptotic cells Figure 7b . Quantitative assessment revealed that Mcl-1 overexpression reduced by 70 % Bax translocation and cytochrome c release induced by IL-1b ? IFN-g Figure 7c , as compared with Ad-LUC-infected cells . Similar data were obtained after a 15 h exposure to thapsigargin Supple-mentary data , Supplementary Figure S4 or palmitate Supplementary Figure S5 , suggesting that Mcl-1 protects b-cells from different pro-apoptotic stimuli by preventing Bax translocation and subsequent cytochrome c release Figure 8 . Acute and short-term changes in Mcl-1 expression do not affect b-cell function or proliferation . Bcl-XL overexpression has been shown to inhibit glucose-induced insulin secretion.7 In contrast , neither Mcl-1 knockdown Supplementary Figure S6a nor overexpression Supple-mentary Figure S6b altered the basal or glucose-stimulated insulin secretion GSIS . Mcl-1 overexpression did not prevent the GSIS inhibition induced by a 15 h treatment with IL-1b ? IFN-g Supplementary Figure S6c . Mcl-1 transgenic mice have increased b-cell mass.25 Under the present experimental conditions , however , a 48-h period of Mcl-1 overexpression did not modify INS-1E cells proliferation , as measured by BrDU incorporation Supplementary data , Supplementary Figure S7 . Discussion The aim of this study was to elucidate the role of the Bcl-2 protein family member Mcl-1 in b-cell function and survival . Knocking down Mcl-1 sensitized b-cells to apoptosis , whereas overexpressing it protected these cells against pathophysio-logically relevant agents pro-inflammatory cytokines or palmitate , as well as chemical ER stressors , showing that Mcl-1 has an important antiapoptotic role in b-cells . Interest-ingly , Mcl-1 was rapidly degraded by cytokines , palmitate and chemical ER stressors , as compared with the other anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL , setting Mcl-1 decrease as a precursor event in b-cell apoptosis . Mcl-1 downregulation was not a transcriptional event , but was secondary to ER stress-mediated inhibition of translation for palmitate and ER stressors , and to the combined action of translation inhibition and JNK activation for cytokines . Altogether , these novel observations strongly suggest that Mcl-1 degradation may be a decisive step leading to b-cell apoptosis in T1D and T2D . Mcl-1 is a very labile protein with a 30�90 min half-life and inhibition of de novo Mcl-1 synthesis results in rapid Mcl-1 downregulation.8 In this study , we confirm our previous findings that palmitate13,26 and cytokines10 induce the PERK-eIF2a pathway in b-cells , leading to decreased protein translation.11 We presently show , using salubrinal , that phosphorylation of eIF2a is sufficient to significantly reduce Mcl-1 protein level . Knocking down PERK confirmed that eIF2a phosphorylation is instrumental in palmitate-and thapsigargin-induced Mcl-1 downregulation . This is in line with previous reports of eIF2a-dependent Mcl-1 downregula-tion in other cell types.27,28 The effect of cytokines is , however , more complex as blocking eIF2a phosphorylation only partly prevents cytokine-induced Mcl-1 downregulation . Mcl-1 stability in other cell types is influenced through phosphory-lation of various residues by multiple kinases , including JNK , ERK and GSK-3b.8 Cytokines induce JNK in b-cells18,29 and phosphorylation of Mcl-1 by JNK facilitates Mcl-1 degradation in HEK293 cells.16 We presently observed that JNK contributes to cytokine-mediated Mcl-1 downregulation . Cytokine-induced JNK phosphorylation is a rapid and transitory event peak at 1 h , probably contributing to the early Mcl-1 degradation 4�8 h . The role of JNK , however , is partial and restricted to cytokines blocking JNK did not prevent palmitate-or thapsigargin-induced Mcl-1 degrada-tion , indicating that translation arrest is the main event leading to Mcl-1 downregulation . ERK-mediated phos-phorylation has been proposed to stabilize Mcl-1 and we previously showed that IL-1b ? IFN-g induce ERK in b-cells.20,21 However , blocking ERK activity had no effect on Mcl-1 expression , suggesting that ERK activation is not a major player in cytokine-induced changes in Mcl-1 expression in b-cells . This is in accordance with previous studies showing that ERK plays a minor role in Mcl-1 regulation in other models.16,30 GSK-3 has also been shown to phosphorylate Mcl-1 , thereby facilitating its degradation 31 however , our present data suggest that INS-1E cells have low GSK-3b activity , and that the kinase is not involved in Mcl-1 regulation . Altogether , our data show that palmitate and thapsigargin decrease Mcl-1 expression by ER stress-dependent inhibition of translation , whereas cytokines induce Mcl-1 downregula-tion by a combination of decreased translation and increased JNK activity Figure 8 . Increasing evidence support the involvement of Bcl2 family members in b-cell apoptosis in response to pro-inflammatory cytokines , saturated FFA and ER stress.3,5�7,13,18,32 Here , we show that cytokines , palmitate and thapsigargin , induce Bax translocation , cytochrome c release and caspase-3 cleavage , independently of changes in Bcl-2 , Bcl-XL , Bax and Bak expression levels , but partly as a consequence of Mcl-1 downregulation Figure 8 . Our data are in agreement with previous studies showing that Mcl-1 , in spite of its preferential mitochondrial localization , 33 is able to prevent Bax activation and translocation.24 The fact that Mcl-1 is unlikely to interact directly with Bax33 suggests that additional factors are involved in the inhibitory action of Mcl-1 on Bax translocation . Truncated Bid tBid is one of the factors contributing to Bax translocation to the mitochondria , 34 and has been shown to be involved in cytokine-induced b-cell apoptosis.35 Mcl-1 has been proposed to act by sequestering tBid , thereby blocking Bax translocation and cytochrome c release.36 Further studies remain to be performed to determine whether Mcl-1 overexpression results in tBid sequestration , and whether this contributes to the blockade of Bax translocation . In vitro studies suggest that Mcl-1 may interact with other BH3-only proteins including Puma , Noxa , Bim and DP5,37 suggesting that additional proteins involved in Bax translocation might be sequestered by Mcl-1 . In line with this hypothesis , we recently showed that the pro-apoptotic BH3-only proteins DP5 Hrk and PUMA , which are rapidly overexpressed in response to ER stress and cytokines in b-cells , are involved in b-cell apoptosis.18,32 Taken together , these data suggest that , at least in the case of cytokines , proteins of the Bcl-2 family are regulated at several levels in b-cells while Mcl-1 is degraded , BH3-only proteins tBid , DP5 , PUMA , etc. are activated , thereby tipping the pro-antiapoptotic balance toward apoptosis . Alternatively , other pro-apoptotic mechanisms involving additional Bcl-2 family members Bim , NOXA , etc. and or other pathways XIAP , FLIPs , etc. may contribute to b-cell apoptosis . Many reports suggest that ER stress plays a major role in palmitate-induced b-cell apoptosis.12,13,26,38 The present data support this hypothesis and provide new insights into the mechanism linking palmitate , ER stress and the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis through eIF2a phosphorylation and Mcl-1 degradation . On the other hand , the role of ER stress in cytokine-induced b-cell apoptosis remains contro-versial.10,38�40 We presently show that the cytokine effects on Mcl-1 require ER stress-dependent and -independent mechanisms JNK activation , suggesting that cytokines may , depending on the severity and duration of exposure , induce apoptosis by ER stress-dependent and -independent mechanisms . This may account for the contradictory findings in this field.10,38�40 Altogether , our data point out Mcl-1 degradation , whether it is due to ER stress or JNK activation , as a novel and common mechanism for b-cell apoptosis triggered by potential death effectors involved in the onset of T1D and T2D Figure 8 . New strategies to prevent the development of diabetes require improving b-cell survival without impairing function , for example , GSIS . Bcl-XL overexpression improves b-cell survival , but impairs glucose oxidation and GSIS , 7 and the BH3-only protein BAD is also an important modulator of GSIS , 41 suggesting that some members of the Bcl-2 family have �day� and �night� jobs in b-cells , affecting both cell survival and function.42 This is apparently not the case for Mcl-1 as neither Mcl-1 knockdown nor overexpression altered GSIS . These observations strongly suggest that the role of Mcl-1 in b-cells is restricted to the control of apoptosis and underline Mcl-1 as a promising target for the development of new strategies aiming to prevent b-cell apoptosis in diabetes .

20829885	www.nature.com cdd Stem cell factor SCF is a cytokine produced by bone marrow stromal cells that stimulates the expansion of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells.1 SCF is specifically essential for erythroid cell development , as mice defective for SCF or its receptor c-kit die before or shortly after birth due to severe macrocytic anemia.1�4 We and others have shown that SCF promotes erythroblast expansion , retards differentiation and protects erythroid precursors from apoptosis.5�7 Among the effectors activated by SCF in differentiating erythroid cells , p38 , ERK and Bcl-2 Bcl-XL have been implicated in stimula-ting erythroblast survival and proliferation.7,8 However , the mechanisms through which SCF modulates erythroid differ-entiation remain mostly unclear . Notch proteins are a family of highly conserved transmem-brane receptors that regulate cell-fate decisions , proliferation , differentiation and survival . Notch receptors are synthesized as 300-kDa precursors that are cleaved by furin-like con-vertases in the trans-Golgi compartment . The resulting N-terminal and C-terminal fragments are assembled into mature heterodimers and exported to the cell surface , where Notch signal transduction is initiated by ligand binding and endocytosis . Subsequent cleavage by ADAM10 TACE Kuz SUP-17 and by the g-secretase complex leads to the release of the Notch intracellular signal-transducing fragment named Notch intracellular domain NICD . NICD then translocates to the nucleus , where it displaces co-repressors associated with the DNA-binding transcription factor CSL CBF-1 SuH Lag-1 and forms a transcriptionally active complex with CSL , Mastermind and co-activators leading to activation of Notch target genes.9 In the hematopoietic system , Notch family members are expressed on both human and murine hematopoietic stem cells HSCs , where they promote cell expansion , self-renewal and immortalization.10 Although canonical Notch signaling has been shown to be dispensable for HSC maintenance , 11 the Notch family still has a complex role in the hematopoietic system by way of modulating cell proliferation , survival and differentiation into multiple lineages . The clearest effects of the Notch system can be observed during lymphopoiesis , wherein Notch activation favors the CD8 and ab cell-fate decisions.12 In the myeloid system , Notch signaling has been reported to modulate differentiation in vitro and in vivo , with cell context-dependent effects that vary between different experimental models and conditions.13 Several in vitro studies have associated Notch signaling with an inhibition of erythroid , granulocytic or megakaryocytic differentiation.14�16 However , Notch has also been reported to increase erythroid maturation or proliferation , to induce monocyte death , or to promote megakaryocytic matura-tion.17�20 In vivo studies on Notch function in the hemato-poietic system have been precluded for a long time because of the embryonic lethal phenotype of mice being homozygously deficient in Notch1 or Notch2.21,22 Later , an inducible Notch1 knockout mouse model revealed an essential role for Notch1 in T-cell lineage induction while leaving all the other hematopoietic lineages unaltered.12 In apparent contradic-tion , mice deficient for the Notch mediator RBP-Jk were found to generate excessive numbers of erythroid cells in the yolk sac , suggesting that the Notch pathway regulates erythroid homeostasis through elimination of developing erythro-blasts.23 More recently , multilineage effects of Notch signaling on myeloid homeostasis were observed in fucosylation-deficient mice , which display a Notch-dependent increase in granulocytic cells but a decrease in bone marrow TER119 ? cells and circulating erythrocytes.24 As Notch family members are known to modulate the differentiation of hematopoietic progenitor cells , we investi-gated whether SCF could modulate the expression of Notch in erythroid progenitors and precursors . We found that SCF induced the expression of the Notch family member Notch2 in differentiating erythroblasts . Interfering with Notch function by g-secretase inhibitor treatment or expression of a dominant-negative Notch2 mutant in primary erythroid precursors a 109 cells ** 108 of ** resulted in decreased erythropoiesis , indicating a necessary role of Notch2 in mediating SCF effects on erythroblast proliferation and differentiation . Altogether , these results show a new mechanism that involves SCF and Notch to control erythropoiesis , which may contribute to maintain postnatal erythroid homeostasis . Results SCF modulates the proliferation and differentiation of primary human erythroblasts . To investigate the mecha-nisms responsible for SCF�s effects on erythroid proliferation and differentiation , we took advantage of a serum-free liquid culture system that allows the production of virtually pure populations of differentiating erythroblasts starting from CD34 ? hematopoietic progenitors Figure 1a .7,25,26 Erythroblasts grown in these culture conditions gradually b Untreated SCF *** become 490 % positive for c-kit expression , whereas this expression tends to decrease during the later stages of maturation Figure 1b . Conversely , Glycophorin A GpA begins to be expressed around day 3 of differentiation , reaching 98�2 % positivity at day 14 of culture Figure 1b . The addition of SCF to erythroblast cultures results in a large increase in cell proliferation Figure 1c with a concomitant delay of erythroid differentiation that manifests with the prevalence of immature basophilic erythroblasts at advanced stages of culture and expression of lower levels of GpA Figure 1d . SCF induces Notch2 expression in erythroid precursors . The mechanisms used by SCF to increase the proliferation and retard the differentiation of hemato-poietic precursors are scarcely understood . As Notch family members have an important role in maintaining the undifferen-tiated state of hematopoietic stem cells , we investigated whether SCF could modulate Notch proteins to exert its effects on the immature erythroid compartment . Therefore , we investigated the expression of Notch1 and Notch2 , the main members of the Notch family expressed in the a day 8 450 - 200 - 5 4 S26 3 Notch1-2 2 1 0 Notch2 hematopoietic system , on cultures of primary erythroblasts untreated or treated with SCF . A short days 6�8 treatment with SCF was chosen to investigate the ability of this cytokine to modify Notch expression in the absence of major alterations of erythroid differentiation . Erythroblast treatment with SCF decreased Notch1 RNA expression while increasing Notch2 RNA Figure 2a . Notch1 protein levels remained unaltered upon SCF treatment , whereas both the mature and immature forms of Notch2 increased significantly Figure 2b . To verify that the increase in Notch2 expression induced by SCF stimulation in erythroid precursors was not due to the presence of a less mature erythroblast population , we stained erythroid precursors with anti-Notch2 anti-GpA antibodies at day 8 of culture , untreated or treated for 2 days with SCF . Such staining confirmed Notch2 induction by SCF , with the increase in Notch2 expression detected by FACS staining 1 log fluorescence scale being coherent with that detected by western blot B10 times fold . Importantly , however , simultaneous GpA staining did not reveal major differences in GpA expression following the short-term treatment with SCF , indicating that the SCF-induced increase in Notch2 was due to protein induction and not c due to a differentiative shift Figure 2c . In line with a prevalent role of Notch2 , but not of Notch1 , in the modulation of erythroid differentiation , we found that Notch2 expression progressively increased , peaking at around days 5�7 of erythroid unilineage culture Figure 2d , whereas Notch1 protein expression progressively decreased during erythroid maturation as compared with the levels found in CD34 ? hematopoietic progenitors Supplementary Figure 1a . Erythroblast response to inhibition of the Notch system was subsequently investigated at days 4�8 of unilineage culture , when high Notch2 expression reflects the pro-erythroblast basophilic erythroblast stage of the vast majority of cells , which possess a high proliferation potential and the homeostasis of which is therefore particularly susceptible by modulation through external stimuli . To investigate whether Notch modulation interfered with the functional effects of SCF stimulation , we treated erythroid precursors with SCF in the presence or absence of L-685,458 , an inhibitor of g-secretase that is known to inhibit the production of functional Notch proteins . While a short-term days 4�8 treatment with L-685,458 alone did not significantly interfere with basal erythroid proliferation , g-secretase inhibition interfered with SCF-induced cell expansion Figure 2e . Longer treatments with L-685,458 resulted in cell toxicity data not shown . The Notch ligand Jagged1 is expressed during erythropoiesis and contributes to SCF-mediated erythroblast expansion . To identify the Notch ligand potentially responsible for Notch2 binding and activation , we investigated the expression of four Notch ligands , Jagged1 , Jagged2 , Delta-like1 and Delta-like3 , in differentiating erythroid cells . We found that only Jagged1 RNA was expressed at detectable levels throughout erythroid maturation Figure 3a , whereas the other ligands showed very low or absent RNA expression Supplementary 3 d0 Fold Cell JAG1 ? -Actin a b day 8 7 Figure 1b . Jagged1 expression was confirmed at the protein level and appeared to be present during the central phases of erythroid differentiation Figure 3b . Then , we determined whether SCF was able to increase Jagged1 expression . Erythroid precursors at day 6 of unilineage culture were stimulated for 2 days with SCF and analyzed for Jagged1 RNA and protein expression . Both Jagged1 RNA and protein remained unvaried upon SCF treatment , suggesting that SCF acts rather by reinforcing Notch2 expression Figure 3c and d . To rule out a potential role of other Notch ligands in mediating SCF effects , we assessed whether SCF was able to modify the expression of Jagged2 , Delta-like1 and Delta-like3 , but RNA levels of such factors remained unchanged upon SCF treatment Supplementary Figure 1c . To understand whether Jagged1 had a role in SCF-mediated modulation of erythropoiesis , we cultivated erythroid precursors for 4 days days 4�8 in the presence or absence of SCF and anti-Jagged1 neutralizing antibodies . We found that blocking Jagged1 receptor�ligand interactions reduced SCF-mediated erythroid cell expansion , suggesting the presence of an autocrine signaling mechanism involving Notch2 and Jagged1 expression on erythroid precursors Figure 3e . Even in the absence of increased protein expression , the ability of anti-Jagged1 neutralizing antibodies to inhibit SCF-induced proliferation indicates that basal levels of Jagged1 provide a sufficient stimulus to activate Notch2 and support SCF-mediated erythroid expansion . SCF modulates the expression of Notch mediators in erythroid precursor cells . In order to depict a possible mechanism of action downstream of Notch2 and responsible for SCF modulation of erythropoiesis , we assessed RNA and protein expression of two major transducers of Notch signals , Hes-1 and Hey-1 . As Notch has previously been shown to modulate GATA-2 expression in hematopoietic cells to inhibit myeloid differentiation , we also analyzed the expression of GATA-2 and its relative GATA-1 in erythroid precursors at day 8 of differentiation , untreated or previously treated for 2 days with SCF . We found that Hes-1 RNA and protein levels , but not Hey-1 levels , strongly increased upon SCF stimulation Figure 4a and b . Likewise , SCF increased RNA and protein levels of the antidifferentiative factor GATA-2 , whereas the pro-erythroid factor GATA-1 remained unvaried Figure 4a and b . Upregulation of Notch2 , Hes-1 and GATA-2 by SCF suggests that this cytokine activates signaling pathways downstream of Notch2 that are responsible for the modulation of erythropoiesis . Interfering with Notch2 function inhibits the effects of SCF on erythroblast proliferation and differentiation . In order to confirm Notch2�s involvement in SCF signaling , we searched for a method to stably interfere with Notch2 activity throughout the erythroid cell maturation . To do so , we developed Notch2 mutant molecules based on pioneer studies demonstrating that specific Notch truncations resulted in constitutively active and dominant-negative forms of the receptor.27 The constitutively active Notch2 mutant Notch2 Intra was constructed by truncating all the extracellular part of the molecule , whereas a dominant-negative Notch2 Notch2 Extra was produced by removing the intracellular part of the receptor Figure 5a . Specifically , the Notch2 Extra mutant was constructed in order to maintain all the extracellular and transmembrane region of Notch2 but excluding the region that interacts with CBF-1 , which was demonstrated to encompass a conserved region adjacent to the cdc10 ankyrin repeats.28 The activity of the two mutants was confirmed by evaluating their ability to modulate the activation of a multimerized CBF-1 binding sequence upstream of the SV40 promoter cloned upstream of the luciferase sequence Figure 5b . The constitutively active and dominant-negative Notch2 mutants were cloned in a bicistronic retroviral vector carrying the GFP reporter gene . A full-length Notch2 gene could not be used in this expression system as its large size B7400 bp exceeded the packaging threshold of the virus . Retroviral constructs containing Notch2 mutants were used to transduce cycling CD34 ? hematopoietic progenitors , which were subsequently sorted for GFP expression and induced to undergo erythroid differentiation through culture in standard erythroid medium . The expression of the truncated Notch2 proteins was detected in packaging cells and in Notch2 Extra-transduced erythroblasts , whereas sufficient numbers of erythroid precursors for immunoblot analysis could not be collected for the Notch2 Intra sample Figure 5c . In fact , we observed 7-AAD C 1.4 Fold 0.2 SSC-Height that on Annexin V 7-AAD staining , the Notch2 Intra-transduced sample revealed a higher rate of apoptotic erythroblasts as compared with the vector-transduced and cells -180 106 cells 80 of 60 Number 40 20 0 Notch2 Extra-transduced samples Figure 5d . To explain this observation , we hypothesized that an elevated Notch2 activity may be incompatible with the first stages of erythroid differentiation , resulting in the death of cells that incorporated a high number of transgene copies , while only cells with a low copy number of constitutively active Notch2 gene could escape apoptosis and mimic SCF signaling . This hypothesis was confirmed by a transgene dosage experiment revealing a decrease in the number of integrated viral copies at late differentiation stages day 12 in the Notch2 Intra-transduced population but not in the vector-transduced population Supplementary Figure 1d . Then , we evaluated the proliferative capacity of erythroblasts transduced with the mutant Notch2 genes . The proliferation of cells expressing Notch2 Extra was evaluated both in the presence and in the absence of SCF , whereas the growth of cells expressing Notch2 Intra was evaluated only in standard erythroid medium , as the mutant gene itself was expected to mimic the effects of SCF . Erythroblasts transduced with Notch2 Extra showed a severely impaired rate of proliferation both in the presence and in the absence of SCF , indicating that dominant-negative Notch2 interfered with both basal and SCF-induced erythroid expansion Figure 5e . Erythroblasts expressing the constitutively active Notch2 mutant also showed an impaired proliferation , according to the increased percentage of dying cells in the early maturation phases Figure 5d and e . When we evaluated the differentiation of erythroblast carrying the Notch2 Extra or the Notch2 Intra genes , we found that the Notch2 Intra sample contained increased numbers of immature cells as compared with the vector-transduced sample Figure 5f , left panel . Conversely , Notch2 Extra-expressing erythroblasts showed an increased presence of mature cells as compared to the control Figure 5f , left panel . Accelerated erythroid differentiation of Notch2 Extra-expressing erythroblasts was observed also when cells were cultivated in the presence of SCF , indicating that Notch2 contributes to SCF-mediated delay of erythroid differentiation Figure 5f , right panel . The presence of mature erythroblasts in culture transduced with the dominant-negative Notch2 Extra gene was confirmed by GpA staining , which revealed increased numbers of GpAhigh cells in the Notch2 Extra sample than in the control vector-transduced sample , both in basal conditions and in the presence of SCF Figure 5g . The Notch signaling system has a complex role in regulating cell proliferation , survival , differentiation and fate specifica-tion . The context-dependent effects of Notch activation are particularly apparent in the regulation of hematopoiesis , where in different systems the Notch pathway has been reported to promote or suppress apoptosis , proliferation and differentiation or even to be dispensable for hemato-poiesis.11,29,30 Redundancy between Notch receptors , complexity of intracellular networks and threshold effects may all contribute to explain the different effects of Notch on hematopoiesis.13 In this context , studies on differentiating primary hematopoietic cells or on simple vertebrates may provide an important contribution to clarify the role of Notch in the control of hematopoietic cell production . The process of erythroid maturation involves sequential waves of proliferation and differentiation that are mainly controlled by erythropoietin . SCF has a key role in the regulation of erythropoiesis as demonstrated by the impaired development of late erythroid progenitors displayed by mice deficient for SCF or its receptor c-kit.1�3 Interestingly , c-kit mutation also results in a severe impairment of stress erythropoiesis , underlying the importance of SCF both in the basal erythropoiesis and in the recovery from acute anemia.31 The molecular pathways responsible for SCF-mediated erythroid proliferative and antiapoptotic effects have been reported to involve multiple effectors including p38 , MAP kinase and Bcl-2 Bcl-XL.7,8 In contrast , pathways activated by SCF that affect erythroid differentiation have been poorly characterized , except for the finding that SCF modulates the activity of cyclin cyclin-dependent kinases to inhibit erythroid cell maturation.32 As both Notch and SCF are able to delay the differentiation of hematopoietic progenitors , we investigated a possible link between the two systems . We observed that Notch2 was strongly induced upon SCF stimulation and that targeting Notch2 signaling neutralized the effects of SCF on erythro-blast expansion and differentiation . The observation that dominant-negative Notch2 depresses erythroid proliferation is in agreement with previous reports showing that Notch inhibition results in reduced erythropoiesis . In particular , a 40 % decrease of bone marrow erythroid cells was detected in fucosylation-deficient mice , which have a defective Notch signaling.24 Interestingly , studies performed on primary human hematopoietic progenitors reported that the simulta-neous presence of SCF and Jagged1 increased erythroid colony formation , 17 anticipating the link between SCF and the Notch pathway described in the present study . Our observa-tion that Notch inhibition impairs erythropoiesis is apparently in contrast with the results obtained in other studies . Mice embryos deficient for the Notch mediator RBP-jk have been reported to display increased numbers of Ter119 ? cells at the yolk-sac level , because of decreased apoptosis of developing erythroblasts.23 In agreement with this observation , activation of Notch signaling in embryonic stem cells has been recently reported to inhibit primitive erythropoiesis.33 This apparent discrepancy may be explained by hypothesizing distinct roles of Notch signaling in different phases of erythroid develop-ment . In early erythroid progenitors as well as during embryonic erythropoiesis , Notch signaling may create a conflict with the process of lineage commitment and result in cell death . Accordingly , we found that CD34 ? hematopoietic progenitors transduced with constitutively active Notch2 undergo apoptosis when forced to undergo erythroid differ-entiation by erythropoietin-containing medium . In contrast , in more mature erythroblasts , elevated Notch expression can result in increased proliferation and differentiative slowdown . Notably , mice with a conditional inactivation of Mind bomb-1 , which is essential for endocytosis of Notch ligands and subsequent Notch signaling , exhibit expansion of the immature erythroid compartment , but reduction of circulating mature erythrocytes.34 Similarly , mice with defective preseni-lin activity , which is necessary for g-secretase cleavage and generation of intracellular Notch , have decreased numbers of mature erythrocytes.35 According to these observations , common myeloid progenitors from mice expressing a domi-nant-negative form of Mastermind-like-1 that sequesters the intracellular domains of all mammalian Notch receptors produce only one-third of erythroid colonies compared with controls.19 Altogether , these evidences suggest that the Notch system has a complex role in regulating the size of the erythroid compartment , possibly by restraining the expansion of immature erythroblasts but at the same time by enhancing the production of more mature erythroid precursors and erythrocytes . The present study adds a new player in SCF-mediated regulation of hematopoiesis , linking SCF-activated signaling pathways to Notch receptors and intracellular mediators . It may be hypothesized that the links between Notch and SCF are not limited to the hematopoietic system . In fact , a connection between SCF and Notch signaling pathways has been previously identified in neural stem cells , where SCF induces Notch expression , possibly contributing to stem cell proliferation.36 Possible correlations between Notch and SCF may also emerge from the melanocytic compartment , where mutations affecting either the Notch system or the c-kit SCF system similarly lead to loss of melanocyte precursors and absence of hair pigmentation.37 Future studies that link different systems regulating cell homeostasis are likely to provide new clues to understand hematopoietic regulation and indicate new potential applications for clinical intervention .

20865013	www.nature.com cdd Ultimately , the entire complexity of the mammalian central nervous system CNS is generated during ontogenesis from a few single cells . Neuronal generation and differentiation can be recapitulated by embryonic stem cells ESCs under appropriate culture conditions.1�6 ESC-based studies of neurodevelopment allow investigations , which are not easily possible in vivo.7 However , known differentiation protocols differ in their suitability for toxicological studies . For instance , older protocols involve a step of embryoid body formation.8 Frequently , only a small number of the initially present ESCs form neurons , and the observation of individual cells is hardly possible . Other protocols use co-cultures with stromal cell lines to differentiate ESCs towards neurons , and would therefore introduce additional complexity into models for developmental neurotoxicity DNT . A recently developed monolayer differentiation protocol allows monitoring of the differentiation procedure and of possible effects of different chemicals during the whole period of differentiation on a single cell level.9 DNT is the form of toxicity least examined and hardest to trace , as it is not necessarily related to cell loss . In all , o0.1 % of frequently used industrial chemicals have been examined , and for the few known toxicants , the mechanism of action is still elusive reviewed in Makris et al.10 Grandjean and Landrigan11 Bal-Price et al.12 . Behavioral pathology in the absence of cell loss is also known from disease models , for example , for Huntington�s disease13 or schizophrenia.14 Toxicants , such as mercury or lead , may trigger behavioral or cognitive deficits without histophathological hallmarks.11 Cellular physiology may be affected during the period of exposure.15 This may eventually lead to changes in differentiation and patterning in the CNS , which is the basis for long-term effects that are observed after the exposure to toxicants has ceased . CNS development is assumed to be orchestrated by waves of gene expression16,17 that determine different intermediate cell phenotypes . Some periods may be more sensitive to certain toxicants than others . Epidemiological proof for such �windows of sensitivity� in organ development with long-term consequences for the organism comes from thalidomide exposure in man3 and various animal models.18 Current test systems based on the differentiation of stem cells to either cardiomyocytes19 or neural cells12 neither yield mechanistic information , nor do they account for the complex-ity of CNS development , that is , the establishment of a balance between multiple neuronal cell types.3,20 The �toxicology for the 21st century� initiative21,22 suggests the identification of pathways as opposed to the current black-box test systems . In the case of ESC-based models of DNT , this requires a detailed understanding of the developmental process leading to multiple different cell types . Detailed knowledge on the waves of gene induction controlling different developmental steps would be an essential prerequisite . However , CNS development is proceeding at different paces . For instance , the anterior and posterior parts of the neural tube follow different kinetics , and some regions of the CNS continue neurogenesis , whereas in other regions , cells have already reached fully post-mitotic stages.20 Our study was undertaken to analyze the wave-like expression pattern of mESC neurodevelopment as a basis for the definition of test windows and markers . This knowledge should help to identify non-cytotoxic , but neuroteratogenic compounds that are able to shift neuronal composition or phenotypes . Finally , the markers should distinguish multiple cell types and differentiation stages , and be able to indicate subpopulations of cells . Results Monolayer differentiation of mESCs to neurons . On day of differentiation 20 DoD20 , the majority of cells was positive for the pan-neuronal markers Tuj1 and NeuN . Many cells also expressed the synapse-associated markers SV2 and PSD95 Figure 1a . As a more quantitative overall measure for the robustness of the differentiation protocol , we chose mRNA expression , which we followed over time . The kinetics for different markers was highly reproducible across experiments Figure 1b . Differentiation to mature , electrophysiologically active neurons was shown by the presence of voltage-dependent Na ? and K ? , and Ca2 ? channels in individual patch-clamped neurons Figure 2a�c , Supplementary Figure S1 . Further experiments also identified spontaneous neuronal electrical activity Figure 2d and action potentials Supplementary Figure S1 . Currents were also evoked by exposure to N-methyl-D-aspartate or kainic acid and blocked by the respective selective antagonists Figure 2e . Thus , our differentiation protocol yielded bona fide neurons . Transcription-based end points to identify disturbed neuronal differentiation . We next investigated whether subtle perturbations of the differentiation process below the cytotoxicity threshold would be detectable by mRNA-based readouts . Parallel mESC cultures were differentiated for 7 , 15 and 20 days and mRNA was prepared for quantitative RT-PCR analysis . These cells were treated during two different time windows DoD1�7 , DoD8�15 with two neuroteratogens Figure 3A . With the concentrations used here , cell death was not detectable data not shown , and cells looked viable and were morphologically indistinguishable from untreated cells Figure 3B . We used the morphogen retinoic acid RA as a known in vivo and in vitro reproductive toxicant and Figure 1 Protein and mRNA-based markers of robust neuronal differentiation of mESCs . a Cultures of mESCs were fixed and stained on day 20 of differentiation . DNA blue was stained with H-33342 . Proteins are indicated as text on the micrograph in the same color as used for the display of their staining pattern . Tuj1 neuronal form of beta-III tubulin NeuN neuron-specific nuclear antigen , encoded by fox3 40 GAD65 glutamate decarboxylase 2 SV2 synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2a PSD95 post-synaptic density protein 95 . Scale bars 20 mm . b mESC cultures n ? 5 biological experiments were differentiated towards neurons , and RNA was prepared at the indicated days of differentiation . Gene expression of the stemness factor Oct4 , the neural stem cell marker Nestin nes , the mature neuronal marker synaptophysin and the glial marker gfap was quantified by quantitative RT-PCR . The mean�S.D. of the relative expression compared with day 0 set to 1 on each diagram was calculated and displayed dotted lines . Relative gene expression data were also obtained by chip analysis and the means n ? 2 are displayed solid line . Note the different scaling of the axes for chip or RT-PCR analysis , which was chosen for reasons of better comparability of the overall curve shapes . The figures in the diagram indicate the relative expression level on DoD20 DoD7 for nestin versus DoD0 , and thus define the axis scaling cyclopamine for its ability to alter sonic hedgehog Shh signaling , resulting in the disruption of patterning gradients responsible for floor plate and ventral neurons.2,20 As expected from the literature , 23 RA induced accele-rated neuronal differentiation increased synaptophysin expression whereas cyclopamine reduced the expression of markers typical for more ventrally located neurons like Shh , Nkx2.1 and Dlx1 , but not overall neuronal differentiation Figure 3A . Thus , marker genes can indicate subtle shifts in differentiation patterns not visible morphologically . When cultures were exposed to cyclopamine from DoD1�7 and immediately analyzed thereafter , treatment did not affect the overall formation of neural precursor cells NPCs , but the reduced Shh expression suggested a reduced ventral development . In cells left to differentiate further without the compound , reduced Shh expression was still observable on DoD15 . A shift of neurotransmitter phenotype from GABAergic Gad2 as marker to glutamatergic Vglut1 as marker 2 was not observed after treatment for the first 7 days , but a significant decrease in Gad2 more ventrally prominent was observable when the cells were treated between DoD8 and 15 . In the case of RA , the acceleration of development synaptophysin was already significant at early stages and we found upregulation of markers usually expressed in caudal parts of the neural tube hoxa6 , hb9 , and associated with the development of motor neuron precursors isl1 Figure 3 . We also examined whether inhibited differentiation was detectable by RNA markers . Early exposure to 3i , a kinase inhibitor mix known for inhibiting differentiation of mESCs , 24 resulted in cultures with retarded neural differentiation indicated by a decreased expression of hes5 , nestin and Tubb3 , and an increased expression of Oct4 Supplementary Figure S2 . Treatment of cells with 3i after DoD7 after neural differentiation had been initiated did not return them to the stem cell state , but was cytotoxic . These examples demon-strated the usefulness of transcript profiling for detection of patterning disturbances . It may be necessary to measure the impact on differentia-tion at different DoD , and specific markers need to be selected for each stage . Figure 2 Electrophysiological evidence for successful neuronal development . Cells were differentiated on glass coverslips towards the neuronal lineage for 20�24 days and then placed into a temperature-controlled recording chamber for whole-cell patch-clamp studies . a Representative example for the currents observed during the 20 ms voltage steps of the whole-cell voltage clamp recording protocol displayed in b . Note that Na ? currents downwards deflection are observed at voltages X 40 mV solid line . Strong depolarizing and repolarizing K ? currents upwards deflection are observed at depolarization to 0 mV dashed line . c For voltage clamp recording voltage step from 80 to 0 mV of Ca2 ? channels , Na ? and K ? channels were blocked by addition of tetrodotoxin , tetraethylammo-niumchloride 5 mM , 4-aminopyridine 10 mM and substitution of intracellular K ? ions by 120 mM Cs ? . Moreover , the measurement of Ca-currents was favoured by a bath solution containing barium ions 10 mM instead of calcium ions . Current traces were obtained without Ca2 ? -channel blocker , or with the blockers nimodipine 1 mM or Cd2 ? 1 mM added . Current data at 15 ms after the voltage step were corrected for cell capacitance indirect measure for cell size and displayed . Data represent means�S.D. **Po0.01 . d Spontaneous action potentials were recorded in current clamp mode 0 pA . At the time indicated by an arrow , tetrodotoxin was added . The dashed line indicates 0 mV membrane potential . The scale bars indicate the dimensions of the membrane potential and the time domain . e Recordings at individual neurons excited with specific glutamate receptor agonists in the presence or absence of blockers . Current traces were recorded after application of N-methyl-D-aspartate NMDA or kainic acid . All agonists were also tested in the presence of their respective specific antagonist traces with 5-aminophosphovalerate AP-5 , 6,7-dinitroquinoxalin-2,3-dione DNQX . The scale bars represent the current and time dimensions of the experiment . Data are representative for nX10 neurons for agonists and n ? 3 for antagonists on neurons with positive agonist response Identification of clusters of genes regulated during neuronal differentiation of mESCs . Using oligonucleotide microrarrays , we analyzed changes in the transcriptome over time to identify toxicity markers . The differentiation kinetics identified in the microarray analysis matched the ones observed during many other well-controlled experiments Figure 1b . The kinetics of expression of each gene represented on the chip was used as input for an unbiased clustering analysis , which yielded eight regulation profiles Figure 4a , Supplementary Figure S3 , besides the genes not regulated at all . Cluster Ia was characterized by rapid downregulation , and cluster Ib by slow downregulation . These two clusters exemplify the principle of superimposed gene regulation waves with different amplitudes . Clusters IIa and IIb contained genes that were transiently regulated at DoD7 IIa up , IIb downregulated . Cluster IIIa and IIIb were characterized by a rapid increase in transcripts between day 0 and DoD7 , maintained then at high levels . Cluster IV contained genes , which remained low until DoD7 and then reached high levels on DoD15 . The final cluster V comprised transcripts that were hardly upregulated until DoD15 , and reached their maximum on DoD20 Figure 4a . The genes were subjected to a more detailed analysis . Of 40 genes that characterize the initial mESC stage , 3 33 were identified and all were downregulated Figure 4b . Most NPC markers were found in clusters IIa and IIIa b , containing genes upregulated early . In contrast to this , most neuronal markers were found in the clusters with increasing gene expression III�V , whereas about 20 % were found in cluster IIa transient upregulation on DoD7 Figure 4b . The clusters identified by unbiased bioinformatics methods may therefore correspond to waves of real biological processes underlying the differ-entiation of mESCs to neurons . To explore this working hypothesis , we continued with an analysis of the biological significance of genes in individual clusters . Loss of pluripotency is accompanied by progressive changes in transcripts responsible for chromatin organization and DNA cell cycle functions . Genes in cluster I were analyzed for gene onthology GO categories significantly overrepresented . Besides the cell cycle , we found chromatin structure and epigenetic processes to be affected Figure 5a , Supplementary Figure S4 . All genes known to be associated with chromosome structure , DNA Figure 4 Cluster analysis of mRNA time course profiles , and their association with distinct phases of differentiation . a Gene expression kinetics was determined for all genes represented on the chip . An unbiased clustering analysis of the kinetic profiles of all regulated genes was performed . For each cluster named Ia , Ib , IIa , IIb , IIIa , IIIb , IV , V , the means of the absolute expression level of all genes in the respective cluster , for each analysis time point , are displayed and plotted on a logarithmic scale n number of genes in the cluster b . Number of genes expressed in mESCs ESCs ? 40 evaluated , 33 found , NPCs 73 evaluated , 63 found and developing neurons N were analyzed by extensive literature search mESCs , NPCs or GO-analysis N . The relative distribution of these genes across the different clusters was calculated in % and displayed e.g . 65 % of all ESC markers was found in cluster Ia , 35 % of all N markers in cluster III replication , DNA repair and DNA methylation were downregulated . Also , most of the genes coding for histones , histone modifiers , chromatin remodeling and chromatin substructuring were found in clusters Ia b . Confocal microscopy showed that chromatin distributed relatively homogeneously over the nucleus in mESCs , but was organized entirely differently after 20 days of differentiation Figure 5b . Correlation of neural precursor formation with a strong , transient change in gene expression levels . We examined whether genes of cluster II were specifically linked to the process of NPC formation . Nestin was expected , and found , in cluster IIa . Nestin-positive cells were often arranged in ring-like structures , reminiscent of rosettes or two-dimensional neural tubes25,26 Figure 6a . Quantification by flow cytometry analysis confirmed the immunocytochemical finding that about 80 % of all cells in the culture became nestin positive Figure 6b . High synchronization of differentiation was suggested by the sharp expression profile of genes in cluster IIa Figure 6c . Besides nestin , many other genes typically associated with neuroepithelial precursors NPCs and neurogenesis were found in cluster IIa Supplementary Figure S3 . Also some genes associated with early , but definitive neuronal development were identified Dll1 , Hes3 . Cluster IIa also contained apparently unspecific genes e.g . Jak2 , Foxd4 , Bcl-2 , Kif21a , Agtr1a , Moxd1 , Aacs , Arl2bp , Scd2 . We examined which GO categories were statistically overrepresented by cluster IIa genes . The GO �nervous system development� emerged with a P-value o10 13 , and only neuronal neurodevelopmental GOs were identified with the exception of ossification eight weakly significant genes Table 1 . Thus , genes of cluster IIa represent an important end point for testing the disturbed proliferation and differentiation during the neuroectodermal neuronal development time window . Markers of regional fate decisions in the CNS . We examined the expression of regional markers in cluster IIa . Amongst the few markers expressed , those for forebrain Foxg1 and hindbrain Hoxa2 b2 were evenly distributed Figure 6d . Also , in the clusters containing continuously upregulated genes IIIa b , IV ? V , forebrain Reln , midbrain En1 2 and hindbrain Lmx1a or Hoxa1 markers were evenly distributed Supplementary Figure S5 . Accordingly , our experimental model appears to reflect several parallel lines of in vivo neural specification , and the ratios of expression of different patterning markers may provide sensitive indicators of disturbed neurodevelopment . Specificity for neuronal induction with respect to glial cells . The transcriptional profile allowed us a detailed analysis of potentially contaminating non-neuronal cells . Some small GFAP-positive cell areas were reproducibly 1�2 small islands cm2 identified by immunocytochemistry Figure 7a . As an unbiased search for overrepresented GO categories did not result in any hits related to gliogenesis Table 2 , we used a list of 25 astrocyte-related genes3 and found 11 of them to be upregulated on DoD20 compared with DoD0 , with four additional astrocytes-related genes transiently upregulated on DoD7 Figure 7b . This early upregulation of apparent astrocytic markers e.g . vimentin may be owing to the generation of radial glia-like NPCs at DoD7 . This cell type , as exemplified by the upregulation of Fabp7 in cluster IIIb27 or Ascl1 ? Mash1 , 28 shares many markers with astrocytes.5 The late upregulation of astroglial markers was corroborated by qPCR Figure 7c . Small increases in this astrocytic population may affect toxicity testing during the later differentiation phases . Microglia appeared to be absent . The contribution of oligo-dendrocytes appears to be negligible . Specificity for neuronal induction with respect to other germ layer lineages . All GO categories significantly overrepresented by the genes of clusters III�V upregulation on DoD20 versus DoD0 were determined bioinformatically , and were searched for evidence of non-neural cell type formation . Individual clusters did not indicate any non-neural cell types while representation of neuronal GOs was highly significant Table 2 . Upon pooled analysis of clusters IV and V , the GOs �blood vessel development� and �muscle organ development� emerged as significant . Thus , a subpopulation of cells present on DoD20 may display smooth muscle features . Waves of clustered genes related to neuronal induction . For characterization of the cultures , we used non-biased bioinformatics methods to identify overrepresented GOs Table 2 . In a complementary approach , based on literature and expert judgement , we hand-picked interesting groups of genes Figure 8 . The major result from this combination of strategies was our finding that the differentiation did not proceed as sequence of sequential steps , but rather involved strongly overlapping processes with one underlying large wave cluster IIIa b superseded by shorter waves cluster IV and V . For instance , generation of neurons and axogenesis growth cone formation seemed to be ongoing in the entire period from DoD7 to DoD20 , as indicated by groups of neuroreceptors and growth cone axon guidance-related genes in cluster III Figure 8a and b . A larger group of genes associated with synaptic vesicles or the transmission of nerve impulse only appeared later cluster IV V . In the latest phase , genes associated with �responses to stress� and �hormonal stimuli� , �regulation of extracellular matrix components� and genes known to be �associated with hereditary neurodegenerative diseases� were strongly upregulated Table 2 , Figure 8c . Analysis by PCR confirmed the latter finding . The upregulation for disease-associated genes from DoD0 to DoD20 n ? 2 differentiations was 92-and 16-fold for the Alzheimer�s disease associated genes App and Mapt , 273-fold for the schizophrenia-associated gene Nrnx1 , 91-fold for the prion protein Prnp and 19-fold 56-fold for the Parkinson�s disease - related genes Pink1 Snca . We wondered whether toxicants with a purported role in the developmental origins of neurodegenerative diseases see Supplementary Figure S6 , such as lead , affect this very late phase of neuronal differentiation . The transcript levels of two neuronal markers and the set of disease-associated genes were used to examine differences in differentiation . Lead exposure had a dampening effect on the expression of App , Mapt , Nrnx1 and Prnp Figure 8d . Thus , the knowledge on markers together with that of the expected timing of their expression provides an ideal toolkit for fine-mapping of subtle developmental disturbances . We have here demonstrated a concept of overlapping waves of gene regulation and suggested its use to define protocols , test windows and end points for DNT testing . Our findings should be helpful to close a gap between two highly developed , but isolated disciplines experimental develop-mental neurobiology and toxicology . The former has been highly successful in defining the functional importance , regional expression and cell type association of genes . The latter has an urgent need for robust and sensitive marker genes to identify disturbances of development . We showed that subtle changes in the speed of differentiation , or in dorso� ventral or anterior�posterior patterning owing to toxicants can be detected by using the right choice of mRNA markers . Such changes may be considered in vitro correlates of known Table 1 GO categories significantly overrepresented in cluster IIa Neurod4 , Nes nestin , Cdh2 N-cadherin , Fgf5 , Sema5b , Efnb2 Nefm neurofilament M , Chrna3 cholinergic R , Ntrk3 , Isl1 , Foxg1 Hoxb2 , Egr2 , Smo smoothened , Hes3 hairy and enhancer of split Mtab1b , Foxg1 , Epha7 Eph receptor A7 , Isl1 , Ulk2 , Bmpr1b Gli3 , Hoxb2 , Egr2 early growth response , Smo , Hes3 SP8 , Foxg1 , Bmpr1a , Bmpr1b bone morphogenic protein R. , Hoxa2 Homer1 , Prox1 prospero-related homeobox 1 , Fzd2 , Sdc1 syndecan Mapk8 , Fgf13 , Jak2 , Nrg1 , Fgfr3 , Tgfbr1 , Mapk8 ?

For instance , cyclopamine causes dramatic patterning disturbances holo-prosencephaly in a defined period of brain development RA causes shifts in the anterior�posterior axis organization , favouring the more posterior parts , as found here by transcript markers . Lead affects multiple neuronal types , which is in agreement with the broad pattern of disturbances found here see Supplementary Figure S6 for references . The data also suggest some warning on the limitations of in vitro�in vivo correlations . Although our cyclopamine data suggest a disturbance in patterning , they would not indicate a problem in the separation of the forebrain hemispheres , as observed in animal studies . Thus , observations from stem cell systems will have a major value for raising alerts on certain compounds and pinpointing potential mechanisms , while complementary data from other systems may be required to predict specific effects on humans . Transcriptional profiling studies , relying predominantly on bioinformatics analysis , suffer from the weakness and errors of databases and algorithms . For example , assignment of genes to GO categories is not always perfect . For instance , the GO for gliogenesis contains ubiquitous signaling and metabolic molecules as well as highly specific transcription factors . On the other hand , typical astrocyte markers such as Gfap and glutamine synthetase are not members of this GO . Moreover , the equal weight given to ubiquitous versus specific genes in statistical analysis results in biological skewing . An additional problem is the visualization of the large amount of data in a form that generates meaningful knowledge . With these considerations in mind , we chose to combine bioinfor-matic analysis with classical knowledge-based approaches . During this procedure , the entire hit list of several thousand genes was manually screened , sorted and annotated . A consortium of experts was consulted , and results were compiled in an open access review format.3 We strongly advocate such combined approaches for toxicological sys-tems biology , which is at present driven too strongly by computational methods.22,29 Electrophysiology studies have a rather qualitative char-acter , as the cells that were patched may not represent the entire culture . However , our results fully corroborate earlier findings that functional neurons can be generated from mESCs.8,30 Immunostaining and quantitative RT-PCR were used as classical and established methods to link chip-based transcript profiling to other experiments that have been performed with much higher replicate number . In the future , extensive studies , involving RT-PCR controlled by internal standards , will be necessary for a quantitative definition of a final set of markers . Notably , we did not use differences in absolute values of regulation in the present study as basis for any of our conclusions , and all major conclusions are built on groups of co-regulated and biologically linked genes as opposed to speculations based on the presence or absence of a single gene . Even though mRNA correlated well with protein levels , as for example , in brain inflammation studies , 31 our approach should not be interpreted as phenotype definition on single cell resolution . The genes grouped within the clusters described here are not necessarily expressed in the same cell and therefore do not automatically describe a single biological entity . However , with these caveats , we feel that indicators of disturbances of the default development can be selected with confidence on the basis of our study . In the area of developmental toxicology and especially in DNT , cause�effects relationships are still mostly unknown , and human epidemiological data are only available for a handful of industrial chemicals.11 Rodent data based on the OECD test guideline 426 are available for about 200 substances.10 With this lack of human-relevant information and the better animal database , it appears reasonable for us to perform proof-of-principle experiments for the usefulness of a new approach in rodent cells first , and to validate human cells against these in case of a positive outcome . At present , DNT studies are based on , for example , behavioral , cognitive or neuropathological end points , and the next step towards mechanistic information would be an understanding of changes on the level of cells and in gene expression . The overlapping waves defined here would provide a conceptual framework for this . Such waves i.e. temporally and spatially shifting activation of gene expression are known from many pioneering studies of mammalian Figure 7 Analysis of glia-associated genes . a DoD20 cultures were fixed and stained for GFAP green to identify astrocytes and Tuj1 red to identify neurons . The left image shows a representative overview with large neuronal areas and one typical astrocytic island . The right image shows an astrocytic island in greater detail . Scale bars ? 100 mm . b The table indicates the glia-related genes identified in this study , sorted by the cluster of expression kinetics they fell into . Astrocyte-related genes searched for , but not identified here were glutamine synthetase Glul , S100b , Slc1a2 Glt-1 , Eaat2 , Connexin 30 43 Gjb6 Gja1 , NfiA also found in oligodendrocytes . Oligodendrocyte-related genes not found here were ATP-binding cassette , sub-family A Abca2 , CNPase Cnp1 , a microtubule-associated protein Mtap4 , myelin-glycoproteins Omg and Mog , Olig2 3 Olig2 , Olig3 , myelin protein zero Mpz , Ng2 Cspg4 , NfiA . c Expression of selected astrocyte-related genes was monitored by qPCR on day 0 , 7 , 15 and 20 of two differentiations . Data for each differentiation are given individually . The lines indicate the resulting mean values in vivo CNS development20 and are , for instance , well characterized in high density and resolution in the hippo-campus.32 Waves have also been defined in vitro in mESCs17,33 or differentiating embryonic carcinoma cells.16,34 Here , we extended this concept by relating regulation clusters to underlying biological processes important for toxicity testing . This translation from developmental biology to the toxicological perspective defines the windows of sensitivity relevant for test protocols . In the field of cardiac development , the mESC-based embryonic stem cell test has been frequently applied.19 Exposure of cells during the entire test period is confounded by relatively unspecific toxicity . Therefore , separation of exposure into the proliferation and differentiation phase has been suggested.35 We want to expand this principle here by suggesting four relevant test periods . DoD1�7 testing of lineage commitment , efficiency of NPC formation and of epigenetic changes associated with the transition from pluripotent cells to more committed NPCs . DoD8�15 major phase of neuronal patterning and vesicle development . DoD15�20 a more unexpected , but highly interesting and relevant phase , when most proliferation has ceased and maturation becomes evident by expression of matrix compo-nents , important transporters and disease-associated genes . Our data on lead exposure during this phase show that it will be of high importance for future testing . DoD20 ? has not been explored here . It requires further investigation to determine whether this period can be used as stable reference for neurotoxicity versus DNT , or whether new processes such as synaptogenesis , gliogenesis or myelina-tion take a dominant role here . The major task for the future will be the validation of a larger set of such markers , first with known specific and mechan-istically defined disruptors of developmental pathways , then with known DNT compounds , to select the smallest group of final markers useful for a comprehensive description of toxicities triggered by the test compounds .

CGR8 , a widely available murine ESC mESC line suitable for feeder-free culture maintenance and with established potential to develop along the neuroectodermal and neuronal lineage36,37 was kindly provided by K-H Krause Geneva . Cells were cultured in complete Glasgow�s modified Eagles medium GMEM , supplemented with 10 % heat inactivated fetal bovine serum FBS PAA , Pasching , Austria , 2 mM glutamax , 100 mM non-essential amino acids , 50 mM b-mercaptoethanol , 2 mM sodium pyruvate and 1000 U ml leukemia inhibitory factor Chemicon . Cells were kept at 37 1C in 5 % CO2 on tissue culture plates coated with 0.1 % gelatin , and were routinely passaged every 48 h . The mESCs were differentiated towards the neural lineage according to the protocol developed by Ying and Smith.9 At critical steps , we used the following parameters cells were plated in the priming phase at 1.2 105 cells cm2 in complete GMEM on 0.1 % gelatin-coated Nunclon culture dishes Nunc , Langenselbold , Germany .

On day 7 of differentiation DoD7 for neuronal generation and maturation , cells were replated at 104 cells cm2 on poly-L-ornithin 10 mg ml and laminin 10 mg ml -coated Nunclon dishes in N2 B27 medium . Cells were fed every other day with complete medium change with N2 B27 medium . Immunostaining and FACS analysis . For immunocytochemical analysis , cells were fixed with methanol 20 1C or 4 % paraformaldehyde PFA in phosphate-buffered saline PBS and permeabilized with 0.1 % Triton X-100 in PBS . After blocking with 10 % FBS , cells were incubated with primary antibodies Tuj1 Figure 8 Functional assignment of neuronal genes upregulated in different waves .

After incubation with appropriate secondary antibodies , nuclei were counterstained with Hoechst H-33342 dye . Images were taken on the original cell culture dishes using an IX81 inverted microscope Olympus , Hamburg , Germany equipped with a -40X , NA 0.6 long-range lens and processed using CellP imaging software Olympus . For confocal microscopy , cells were grown on four-well chamber slides Nunc , fixed with 4 % PFA 2 % sucrose in PBS and permeabilized with 0.6 % Triton X-100 in PBS . After blocking with 5 % BSA 0.1 % Triton X100 in PBS , cells were incubated with Tuj1 antibody in blocking buffer for 1 hour at room temperature . After incubation with appropriate secondary antibodies , nuclei were counterstained with DAPI . Confocal images were taken using a Zeiss LSM 510Meta confocal microscope equipped with a Plan Apochromat -63X , NA 1.4 oil DIC lens . Images were analyzed and processed using ImageJ . For flow cytometry , cells were dissociated on DoD7 with accutase , fixed and permeabilized in Cytofix Buffer followed by Perm Buffer I both BD Biosciences , and stained with anti-nestin antibody conjugated to Alexa-647 , or isotype control . Cells were analyzed with an Accuri C6 flow cytometer Accuri Cytometers , Ann Arbor , MI , USA and data were processed with CFlow Plus Accuri Cytometers . Quantitative PCR and quality control of differentiation . Total RNA of five independent differentiation experiments , performed at different times , with different CGR8 cell batches , and by different operators was isolated at indicated time points for marker gene expression analysis using Trizol , the RNA was retro-transcribed with SuperScript II reverse transcriptase , and the resultant cDNAs were amplified in a Biorad Light Cycler Biorad , Munchen , � Germany with primers specific for the genes of interest and designed for a common melting temperature of 60 1C . Real-time quantification for each gene was performed using SybrGreen and expressed relative to the amount of gapdh mRNA using the 2 DD C T method.38 For each run , the consistency of conditions and constancy of gapdh amounts in the samples were controlled by assessment of its absolute cycle number ? 18�0.5 . Gene expression analysis . Cells were used for RNA preparation as undifferentiated mESCs before the priming phase day 0 , on DoD7 before replating , DoD15 and DoD20 . RNA was extracted from Trizol preparations and purified using RNeasy Mini prep columns Qiagen , Hilden , Germany . The total RNA harvested was quantified using a Nanodrop device Thermo Scientific , Waltham , MA , USA and its integrity was assessed using Agilent Bioanalyser Agilent , Santa Clara , CA , USA . Illumina TotalPrep RNA Amplification Kit Ambion , Foster City , CA , USA and 500 ng total RNA of each sample was used according to the manufacturer�s protocol to produce biotin-labelled cRNAs . For hybridization onto Sentrix Mouse Ref.8 V2 mRNA microarray beadchips Illumina , San Diego , CA , USA , 750 ng of labeled cRNA were incubated for 16 h at 58 1C . After hybridization , chips were washed , blocked and streptavadin-Cy3 stained . Fluorescence emission by Cy3 was quantitatively detected using BeadArray Reader Scan . Statistical analysis data are based on duplicate samples . Each of the samples contained pooled RNA from two differentiations to further increase robustness of results . Technical variation of the chip was minimal as tested by rerun of the same sample on two different arrays and by comparison of results from two beadchips within one array . Data analysis . Original and processed data have been deposited for public access in the EBI Arrayexpress database accession no . E-TABM-1068 , specified release date 30 September 2010 . For initial processing , data were uploaded to Beadstudio Illumina for background subtraction . Further processing baseline transformation and normalization to 75 percentile and analysis was performed with Genespring 9.0 Agilent , and all normalized expression kinetics data sets were used as input for an unsupervised non-hierarchical clustering with relation to the average of expression of all genes on the chip , using the K-means algorithm . The eight major clusters were selected for further analysis . Within these , significant gene expression profiles were selected , based on a minimum regulation of twofold on any of the time points and on two-way ANOVA , taking into account the regulation range and the variation between different arrays . Patch-clamp recording . For functional characterization , neurons from at least three independent differentiations were tested for electrophysiological activity . Electrodes with a resistance of 2�5 MO were pulled of borosilicate glass Clark , G150F Warner Instruments , Hamden , CT , USA on a Sutter Instruments Novato , CA , USA P-97 horizontal micropipette puller . All experiments were carried out using a custom built recording chamber 800 ml volume made of Teflon within a temperature-controlled microscope stage 37 1C . Whole-cell voltage and current clamp recordings were obtained from cells at DoD20�24 . Cells were grown on coated glass cover slips 10 mm from DoD7 . Whole-cell currents were recorded using an L M-EPC-7 amplifier List Medical Electronic , Darmstadt , Germany , digitised at sampling frequencies between 10�50 kHz using a DigiData 1320A AD DA converter Axon Instruments Inc. . The patch pipettes for spontaneous and evoked action potential measurements as well as for the neurotransmitter responses were filled with in mM 90 K ? -gluconate , 40 KCl , 1 MgCl2 , 10 NaCl , 10 EGTA , 4 Mg-ATP , 10 HEPES KOH pH 7.4 at 37 1C , whereas the bath solution contained in mM 155 NaCl , 1 CaCl2 , 3 KCl , 10 D- ? -glucose , 10 HEPES NaOH pH 7.4 at 37 1C . The protocol for recording of Na ? and K ? channels was as follows cells were hyperpolarized to 90 mV , and subsequently stepped to a defined voltage as indicated and returned to 70 mV , before the next cycle , with a different voltage step , was run . Each cycle took 120 ms . For the neurotransmitter response measurements , the different substances were directly added as concentrated stock solutions to the recording chamber in amounts of 1�10 ml . Antagonists were added at least 1 min before the agonists . Recordings were initiated within 100 ms after addition of agonists . For the measurement of barium currents through calcium channels , the pipette filling solution contained in mM 110 CsF , 10 NaCl , 20 TEA-Cl , 10 EGTA , 4 Na2-ATP , 10 HEPES CsOH pH 7.4 at 37 1C , whereas the bath solution contained in mM 130 NaCl , 10 BaCl2 , 10 D- ? -glucose , 5 tetraethylammonium chloride , 10 4-aminopyridine , 0.5 tetrodotoxin , 10 HEPES NaOH pH 7.4 at 37 1C . All current signals were normalized against the individual cell capacitances as a surrogate measure for cell size and are expressed in current densities current divided by cell capacitance . Liquid junction potentials were measured and corrected , using the method described by Erwin Neher 1992 , except for barium current measurements . Stimulation , acquisition and data analysis were carried out using pCLAMP 10.2 Axon Instruments Inc. , Sunnyvale , CA , USA and ORIGIN 8.0 OriginLab Corp. , Northampton , MA , USA . Fast and slow capacitive transients were canceled online by means of analog circuitry . Residual capacitive and leakage currents were removed online by the P 4 method . Series resistance compensation was set to at least 50 % . For analysis , traces were filtered offline at 5 kHz . Cells for measurements were chosen with respect to their morphological phenotype small , round , highly elevated phase-bright cell bodies with projections of at least five times the cell body diameter , growing in network-like clusters containing at least 20� 30 similar cells . The patch pipette was approached to these cells perpendicular to the plane formed by the cell membrane in the patch region . Statistics and data mining . The numbers of replicates of each experiment are indicated in figure legends . Data were presented , and statistical differences were tested by ANOVA with post-hoc tests as appropriate , using GraphPad Prism 4.0 Graphpad Software , La Jolla , CA , USA . Assignment of significantly overrepresented GO categories to different clusters and calculation of probabilities of a false-positive assignment was performed by G-profiler http biit.cs.ut.ee gprofiler 39 . For coverage of biological domains without appropriate and well-controlled GO category , relevant genes were assembled from the literature and cross-checked by 2�3 independent specialists . The number of genes within these groups identified in this study was indicated in relation to the overall number of possible hits or in relation to their distribution over different clusters . The genes defined in this study as embryonic stem cell markers or neural stem cell NPC markers were derived from recent literature.3 Neuronal N differentiation markers n ? 574 were defined as all members of GO GO 0048699 generation of neurons corrected for those genes used as NPC markers . The graphical representation of identified genes or groups within their biological context is based on the major gene function as indicated on the NCBI-gene website and the literature . Importantly , members of each identified group were scored according to their suitability as markers for a PCR-based quality control of the differentiation pattern in toxicity experiments . Several selection rounds were run to identify the final set of markers displayed as example genes in the tables and some of the figures . Toxicity experiments . Cells were exposed to chemicals during different phases of differentiation to test the suitability of the model system for neurotoxicity testing , and for testing of DNT during defined time windows . RA 1 mM , �3i� a mixture of 0.8 mM PD184352 , 2 mM SU5402 , 3 mM CHIR99021 24 or cyclopamine 1 mM were added to cultures from DoD1�DoD7 or from DoD8�DoD15 . Then , the experiment was ended , or incubation was continued in the absence of chemicals for additional 6 days . On the final day , RNA was prepared by the Trizol method for PCR analysis . For morphological observations , the monolayer regions within the culture wells were imaged . Genes were preselected before the analysis as end points for initial proof-of-concept experiments , and results from all genes chosen are presented .

Autophagy has important roles in tissue development , differentiation and remodeling.7 It is also implicated in diseases such as tumor development , but its precise role is ambiguous . A number of antineoplastic therapies , including radio-therapy and DNA-damaging chemotherapy , have been observed to induce autophagy.8,9 Whether autophagy induced by antineoplastic therapies facilitates tumor cell death or represents a self-defense mechanism for resisting therapy remains controversial . Several observations support the argument that autophagy is detrimental to cancer cell survival , including the fact that the ability of radiation or chemotherapy to induce cell death in cancer cell lines that display resistance to apoptosis depends on autophagy induction.8 On the other hand , mounting evidence suggests that autophagy represents a self-protective strategy against antineoplastic treatment by abrogating apoptosis.10 These seemingly contradictory findings indicate that there is not a unique paradigm addressing the role of autophagy in tumorigenesis . Accordingly , it is conceivable that autophagy may have different roles in the different stages , or contexts , of tumorigenesis . Evidence to date indicates that the antitumor effect of SCFAs is based on their ability to induce apoptotic cell death Type I Programmed cell death PCD in colon cancer cells.11 Interestingly , SCFAs have been reported to increase the expression of a broad range of mitochondria-related genes and a spectrum of genes related to protein turnover , but the physiological relevance is yet to be understood.12 Herein we report that SCFAs , particularly propionate , induced autophagy and induction of autophagy attenuated the therapeutic efficacy of SCFAs toward colon cancer . Results Induction of autophagy by propionate in colon cancer cells . SCFAs , particularly propionate and butyrate , are well-known for their antitumor effects toward colon cancer.13 In agreement with these reports , propionate inhibited HCT116 and SW480 cells with IC50 of 9 and 20 mM , respectively , whereas butyrate was more cytotoxic with an IC50 of 5 mM Supplementary Figure S1 . The re-distribution of GFP-LC3 to easily visualized �puncta� is a commonly used technique to monitor the autophagosome formation during autophagy . Propionate exposure promi-nently triggered the formation of characteristic punctate GFP-LC3 , suggesting the recruitment of GFP-LC3 during autophagosome formation Figure 1a . Treatment with propionate 3 mM resulted in a 10-fold increase in the percentage of cells with punctate GFP-LC3 compared with cancer cells treated with PBS by 36 h Figure 1bi . Propionate induced autophagy in a time-dependent manner Figure 1bii . Lysosomal-associated membrane protein 2 LAMP-2 , an important constituent of the lysosomal membrane , has been reported to be critical for the lysosomal degradation of autophagic vacuoles.14 Propionate caused an extensive upregulation of LAMP-2 expression Figure 1c and Supple-mentary Figure S2a . The upregulated LAMP-2 displayed punctate structures and colocalized with GFP-LC3 dots , indicating autolysosome formation . The formation of punctate GFP-LC3 after propionate treatment was not confined to HCT116 cells but was also observed in SW480 cells with stable GFP-LC3 expression Supplementary Figure S2d and e . Butyrate induced autophagy in both HCT116 and SW480 cells in a manner similar to propionate Data not shown . During autophagosome formation , nascent LC3 is processed into soluble form LC3-I , which is further modified to form autophagosomal membrane-incorporated LC3-II , and the latter protein can be separated from the nonconjugated form LC3-I and detected by immunoblotting . Immunoblot analyses revealed the presence of LC3-II after propionate treatment , and the level of LC3-II reached the highest level by 3 mM of propionate treatment Figure 1ei . The degree of LC3-I to LC3-II conversion was initially low as early as 6 h posttreatment with propionate but significantly enhanced thereafter Figure 1eii . Aside from LC3 , p62 SQSTM1 , another biochemical sign of autophagy , was reduced Figure 1d , 1ei and ii and Supplementary Figure S2b . On the other hand , the level of ATG7 , which is essential for autophagosome formation , was upregulated . Propionate also increased the conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II and of GFP-LC3-I to GFP-LC3-II and reduced the p62 level in SW480 cells Supplementary Figure S2g . Cells undergoing autophagy generally develop double-membraned , acidic vesicular organelles autophagosomes , which can be detected by specific dyes . Treatment of HCT116 cells with increasing concentrations of propionate resulted in a progressive increase in LysoTracker or MDC-stained autolysosome-like structures , which resembled punctates Figure 1a and 1fi . Furthermore , GFP-LC3 punctates were largely colocalized with LysoTracker and MDC staining , indicating the formation of autolysosomes . The formation of autophagic vacuoles peaked at a propionate treatment with a concentration of 3 mM and could not be further promoted by increasing the propionate concentration Figure 1fi . Propionate also increased the number of autophagic vacuoles in SW480 cells Supplementary Figure S2d and f . Taken together , we conclude that formation of cytoplasmic acidic vesicular organelles , which is characteristic of autophagy , occurred in propionate treated cells . Because LC3-II is subject to lysosomal degradation during autophagy , increased LC3-II levels do not always accurately reflect full-fledged autophagy induction . Instead , LC3-II accumulation could occur when downstream protein degra-dation is impaired . To assess autophagic flux more precisely , we assessed the accumulation of LC3-II in the presence of lysosomotropic agent chloroquine CQ , which blocks the last critical step in autophagy , the acid-dependent degradation of autophagosome contents . A combination treatment with propionate and CQ resulted in the accumulation of LC3-positive vesicles and caused an up to 10-fold increase in punctate LC3 fluorescence after 24 h Figure 1a and f . A further accumulation of LC3-II , GFP-LC3-II and p62 was detected Figure 1c and eiii . We also found that CQ substantially promoted the accumulation of acidic vesicular organelles Figure 1a and f . Taken together , these observa-tions further support the conclusion that propionate-mediated increase in LC3-II expression was a consequence of accelerated autophagosome formation , rather than impaired lysosomal clearance . Propionate induced autophagy activation is associated with mTOR pathway inhibition . Autophagy regulation is a complex process that depends on a spectrum of factors . It is well established that the mammalian target of rapamycin mTOR negatively regulates autophagy.15 mTOR auto-phosphorylation at Ser2481 is regarded as an indicator for its catalytic activity . Western blot analysis revealed that propionate caused a strong time-dependent reduction in the phosphorylation state of mTOR at Ser2481 , whereas the total mTOR level was not changed noticeably Figure 2 . Immunoblotting analyses revealed a clear decrease in phos-phorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding proteins 4E-BP1 , a key downstream effector of mTOR activity , 16 in a dose-and time-dependent manner after exposure to propionate Figure 2 . Further , we analyzed the phosphory-lation status of another major mTOR substrate p70S6K , whose phosphorylation status at Thr389 has been described to reflect mTOR activity , 17 whereas phosphorylation at Thr421 Ser424 is thought to activate p70S6K through the relief of pseudo substrate suppression . Reduced phosphorylation of p70S6K at Thr389 was noted by 7h following propionate treatment , and by 25h , a measured three-fold decrease in the ratio of p70S6K P-Thr389 to total p70S6K was observed Figure 2 . The level of p-p70S6K on Thr421 Ser424 , showed a pattern similar to p-p70S6K on Thr389 . We also found that the phosphorylation of mTOR at Ser-2448 , which was reported to be the target of p70S6 kinase , 18 was reduced as well . Propionate also inhibited mTOR pathway in SW480 cells Supplementary Figure S3 . Collectively , these observations confirmed that downregulation of the mTOR signaling pathway is a mechanism for propionate to induce autophagy . SCFA downregulation of mTOR pathway is associated with AMPK pathway activation . To characterize the molecular mechanisms underlying the reduced mTOR activation and concomitant autophagy induction by SCFA , we investigated the activation status of upstream signaling events involved in mTOR regulation . Of note , two separate pathways leading to the activation of mTOR have been well established the oncogenic Akt protein kinase B-PI3 K pathway , which activates mTOR in response to the intro-duction of nutrient and growth factors , and the AMP-activated protein kinase AMPK pathway , which inhibits mTOR activity in response to metabolic stresses such as nutrient starvation-induced cellular ATP depletion.19 We firstly hypothesized that propionate induced mTOR signaling activation might be resulted from PI3K-Akt pathway inhibition . Immunoblot analysis did not detect any noticeable difference in the phosphorylation of Akt at either Thr308 or Ser473 , and the expression level of class I III PI3-kinases Figure 3a . The level of non-phosphorylated Akt was not changed either . Interestingly , a slight but consistent decrease in PTEN expression was observed Figure 3a . The data suggest that the downregulation of the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway is not involved in propionate-induced downregulation of mTOR pathway . Next , we analyzed whether AMPK signaling pathway activation is responsible for mTOR pathway inhibition during propionate treatment . As a primary sensor of cellular bio-energetics , the AMPK-mediated signaling pathway has been described to sense the intracellular energy status and to regulate cellular metabolism . AMPK has been reported to be a positive regulator of autophagy.20 Phosphorylation of AMPK at the a subunit at threonine 172 Thr172 in response to an increased AMP to ATP ratio has been shown to be required for the activation of all known AMPK homologs.21 Propionate increased the phosphorylation level of AMPKa in HCT116 cells as early as 7 h following propionate treatment Figure 3b . In addition , despite the report that phosphory-lation of either Thr258 or Ser485 491 does not cause any detectable activation of AMPK , 21 we observed an elevation in the phosphorylation of AMPKa at Ser485 for a1 and Ser491 for a2 Figure 3b . Phosphorylation of one direct downstream target of AMPK , acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase ACC , was detected . Propionate also increased AMPKa phosphorylation at Thr172 in SW480 cells Supplementary Figure S4 . AMPK exists in cells as a heterotrimeric complex composed of a catalytic kinase subunit a and two regulatory subunits b and g . The presence of b g subunits contributes to the stability of the a subunit , helps prevent the auto-inhibitory domain with its active site , and enhances the allosteric activation Thr172 phosphorylation by AMP . Contrary to the increased phosphorylation at Thr172 of the a subunit , propionate dramatically diminished the phosphorylation level of the AMPK b subunit at both Ser181 and Ser182 , especially at a high concentration 10 mM Figure 3b . In addition , AMPK g-1 was reduced as well Figure 3b . Whether the decreased b1 subunit phosphorylation and g expression have a part in the regulation of AMPK during propionate treatment awaits further investigation . To further investigate the dependence of AMPK on propionate mediated mTOR signaling inhibition and auto-phagy activation , we used HCT116 cells infected with doxycycline-inducible expression of shRNAs against AMPKa . Consistent with the role of AMPK in downregulation of mTOR signaling activity , propionate-mediated inhibition of p70S6 kinase phosphorylation was markedly less pronounced in cells infected with AMPKa shRNA Figure 3c . Propionate-triggered autophagy induction was also impaired in AMPKa shRNA-infected cells , thus confirming that AMPK activation was a principal mechanism underlying these events Figure 3c . Taken together , we conclude that propionate induction of autophagy in HCT116 and SW480 cells is based on AMPK pathway activation , instead of a decrease in PI3K-Akt signaling , and subsequent downregulation of mTOR . Propionate-induced AMPK signaling activation is associated with mitochondrial defect-induced cellular ATP depletion and oxidative stress . The data described above show that propionate inhibited the mTOR pathway by causing AMPK activation . AMPK is exquisitely sensitive to changes in the concentration of ATP . We therefore determined whether AMPK activation by propionate is caused by cellular ATP reduction . Figure 4a shows that after an acute increase starting from 30 min and lasting for up to 5 h , the intracellular ATP level declined steadily in HCT116 cells following propionate treatment . Propionate induced ATP reduction and AMP ADP upregulation was further confirmed by HPLC Supplementary Figure S5a . A similar ATP fluctuation pattern following propionate treatment was also observed in SW480 cells Supplementary Figure S5b . Depletion of energy sources or defective cellular energy generation would cause ATP depletion . Therefore , we next investigated whether the reduced cellular ATP during propio-nate treatment is achieved through reduced mitochondria mass , impaired mitochondria functionality or both . Propionate led to depolarization of mitochondrial membrane as reflected by increased numbers of JC-1 stained cells , with reduced JC-1 fluorescence in the lower red fluorescence signal intensity FL-2 axis Figure 4bi . In addition to JC-1 , we also used MitoTracker Deep Red , which stains mitochondria in live cells and accumulates in proportion to the membrane potential , to monitor Dc . Flow cytometry allowed identification of two populations of cells with distinct MitoTracker Deep Red staining intensities Figure 4ci and ii . The proportion of mitochondria with the lower florescence intensity , which reflected the depolarized mitochondria , was increased by propionate in a dose-and time-dependent manner Figure 4ciii . The loss of Dc may be caused by increased mitochondrial membrane permeability transition MPT .22 To test whether an induction of MPT was involved with propionate-mediated reduction in Dc , HCT116 cells were treated with propionate and the MPT was analyzed using an established method involving fluorescence staining with MitoTracker Deep Red , calcein-AM and CoCl2 . As shown in Figure 4d , calcein was retained in untreated cells and colocalized with MitoTracker Deep Red-labeled mitochondria . However , propionate treat-ment led to loss of mitochondrial calcein fluorescence , which was due to calcein leakage from the mitochondria and was quenched by the subsequent addition of CoCl2 . In addition , reduced calcein fluorescence was associated with a con-current reduction in MitoTracker deep red signals Figure 4ei , suggesting that the loss of Dc was observed subsequent to continuous pore activation . The induction of MPT was partially blocked by cyclosporine A Figure 4e . Altogether , these data suggest that the loss of Dc was associated with induction of MPT by propionate treatment . Elevated reactive oxygen species ROS generation has been reported following MPT induction.23 In fact , the fermentation products of Propionibacterium , propionate and acetate have been identified to enhance ROS generation in human colorectal carcinoma cell lines.24 Following propionate treatment , the percentage of cells positively stained for carboxy-DCF was increased Figure 4f and g , which was attenuated on adding the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine NAC . We also noticed that the cells positively stained with carboxy-DCF were those with impaired mitochondria membrane potential as reflected by reduced MitoTracker Red staining Figure 4h . The observations suggest that the source of ROS production during propionate treatment is likely originated from defective mitochondria . In addition to increased AMP ATP ratio , ROS serve as signaling molecules to activate AMPK.25 The excessive ROS production has been suggested to have a role in the initiation of autophagy.26 Hence , the anti-oxidative effect of NAC on propionate-mediated auto-phagy was examined . Antioxidant agent NAC inhibited the propionate-induced ROS accumulation Figure 4f and g and attenuated the autophagy induction subsequently Supplementary Figure S5c , providing evidence that ROS might contribute to the onset of autophagy . Cyclosporin A , which could attenuated MPT and reduced the release of ROS data not shown , was also able to alleviate propionate triggered ROS accumulation and subsequent autophagy responses Supplementary Figure S5c . We were , however , unable to completely prevent the autophagic response by NAC or cyclosporin A , suggesting that ROS-independent autophagy was also being induced by propionate . Malfunctioning mitochondria is selectively targeted for autophagic degradation . Because of this , we suspected whether an alternative possibility for reduced cellular ATP production is due to reduced mitochondrial mass . We used MitoTracker Green FM , which localizes to mitochondria regardless of Dc , to measure mitochondrial mass . A slight increase in MitoTracker Green fluorescence was detected 12 h after propionate exposure Figure 4c . Taken together , the findings suggest that the decline in intracellular ATP during propionate treatment be attributed to the loss of Dc rather than to a decrease in mitochondrial mass . Defective mitochondria are targeted for autophagic degradation . Autophagic degradation selectively targets depolarized mitochondria for digestion and elimination , a specific process termed �mitophagy� , purpose of which is to rid the cell of damaged mitochondria and help prevent the activation of apoptotic pathways.27 As demonstrated in Figure 5a , in untreated cells we observed the existence of a punctate mitochondrial distribution . However , in HCT116 cells undergoing propionate-induced autophagy , we observed smeared mitochondrial staining with dramatically reduced staining intensity and increased colocalization between mitochondria and punctate GFP-LC3 . Propionate increased colocalization between punctuate GFP-LC3 and mitochondria was also confirmed by the staining of COXIV Figure 5b . The Untreated Untreated C3 C3+CQ CQ autolysosomes localized defective mitochondria were also supported by increased colocalization between COXIV and LAMP-2 Figure 5c . Increased colocalization between COXIV and an ubiquitin-binding protein-p62 , which interacts with LC3 and regulates autophagosome formation , was also observed Figure 5d . Blockage of autophagic degradation by CQ resulted in an accumulation of mitochondrial aggregates , which overlap with LAMP-2 and p62 aggregates . Untreated C3 C3+CQ CQ Untreated Propionate triggered mitophagy was supported by flow cytometry analysis which showed that the proportion of cells with reduced MitoTracker Deep Red staining and enhanced GFP-LC3 fluorescence was increased significantly following propionate treatment Figure 5di . Termination of autophagic degradation by CQ dramatically increased the accumulation of defective mitochondria Figure 5dii . The findings indicate that mitophagy selectively targets mitochondria with a depolarized membrane potential . Rescue of cellular energy crisis through mitochondria biogenesis and alteration of glycogen and lipid meta - bolic pathways . AMPK provides a finely tuned amplification mechanism for energy homeostasis under conditions of low nutrient availability by downregulating ATP-consuming anabolic pathways and upregulating ATP-producing catabolic pathways.28 In this way , AMPK activation could restore cellular energy homeostasis . In this study , propionate reduced the expression of fatty acid synthase Figure 6a , which stores energy by catalyzing the synthesis of long-chain fatty acids LCFAs from acetyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA . We also found that GSK-3b , which inhibits endergonic glycogen synthesis by phosphorylation and inactivation of glycogen synthase , was downregulated Figure 6a . Furthermore , inactivation of ACC by AMPK-mediated phosphorylation Figure 3b , potentially inhibits de novo lipid synthesis , whereas inactivated ACC increases the mitochondrial import and oxidation of LCFAs , resulting in the generation of ATP.29 Energy deprivation stimulates mitochondrial biogenesis in skeletal muscle in an AMPK-dependent manner.30 We examined several mitochondrial biogenesis markers that are +CQ Time Hours HCT116 pivotal in coordinating transactivation genes for OXPHOS protein expression importation , and heme biosynthesis in HCT116 cells after propionate treatment . As depicted in Figure 6b and c , propionate stimulated Tfam and mtTFB expression at the mRNA level , peaking at 8.5 and 11.5 h , respectively , followed by a return to pre-stimulatory levels . Coordinately , NRF-1 and -2 and pol-g expression at the mRNA level were also stimulated as early as 12 h after treatment but were reduced after long-term treatment . Although the relative increase in mRNA content differed among the various transcription factors , a similar overall trend was observed with rapid induction upon propionate exposure . In contrast to the upregulation of these genes , we observed a time-dependent reduction in PGC-1 transcription Figure 6b and c . To ascertain whether mitochondrial biogenesis was truly induced , we examined the protein level of the mitochondrial redox carriers� subunits . The expression of a number of complex subunits located on the mitochondrial membrane was increased 8 h posttreatment , followed by a return to pre-stimulatory levels after 20 h Figure 6d . The stimulation of mitochondrial biogenesis was also substantiated by an increase in MitoTracker Green FM fluorescence shown in Figure 4c . Altogether , the data suggest that HCT116 cells adapted to propionate-induced ATP depletion by down-regulating anabolic processes such as glycogen and lipid synthesis , whereas stimulating mitochondrial biogenesis in attempt to resume cellular energy homeostasis . Inhibition of autophagy potentiates propionate-induced apoptotic cell death . SCFAs possess antitumor activities by inducing caspase-3-mediated apoptosis.11 To determine the interconnection between propionate-induced autophagy and apoptosis , autophagy inhibitors were applied to examine the cell viability of HCT116 and SW480 cells during propionate treatment . The punctate GFP-LC3 formation observed in the cells treated with propionate was significantly reduced in cells pretreated with 3-MA at 2 mM Figure 7a and b . At 24 and 48 h , combined treatment with 3-MA significantly enhanced the cytotoxic effect of propio-nate Figure 7c . At 12 h after the initiation of treatment , propionate 3-MA treatment resulted in a marked increase in annexin V-positive cancer cells Figure 7d . This difference persisted at 48 h , when a 1.75-fold difference in the percentage of annexin V-positive tumor cells was observed . As an independent approach to reflect cancer cell apoptosis , immunoblots revealed increased cleavages of the pro-apoptotic caspase-7 and executioner caspase-3 , which are critical mediators of the mitochondrial events of apoptosis , 31 in cancer cell lysates obtained 24 h after the initiation of propionate 3-MA treatment compared with those treated with propionate alone Figure 7e . Prevention of autophagic degradation by adding chloroquine also enhanced apoptosis of HCT116 cells , especially at the later stage of treatment 48 h Figure 7d and e . In addition , to substantiate the role of AMPK in propionate-triggered autophagy , we investigated whether shRNA-mediated AMPKa silencing could resemble the effects of autophagy inhibition on propio-nate cytotoxicity . The shRNA-mediated downregulation of AMPKa augmented the propionate toxicity toward HCT116 cells , as demonstrated by a decrease in cell viability Supple-mentary Figure S6d . Altogether , these results suggest that autophagic response has a protective role in impeding the propionate-elicited death of colon cancer cells . To further verify the protective role of autophagy against propionate-induced death , autophagy was suppressed Untreated ** * + + + + + + responses , enhanced-cell death and caspase-3 7 cleavage were also observed in the HCT116 cells with decreased ATG7 expression by the RNA interference Supplementary Figure S6a , b and c . Autophagy inhibition by either a pharmaco-logical 3-MA or CQ or genetic ATG5 shRNA approach also potentiated propionate-triggered apoptosis in SW480 cells Supplementary Figure S6e , f , and g . 3-MA and CQ at higher dosage may have detrimental side effects on tumor cell viability apart from inhibiting autophagy . To confirm the antineoplastic effect of 3MA and CQ depends on their ability to inhibit autophagy-based survival , propionate 3MA or propionate CQ treatment of cancer cells was compared with those in which autophagy was genetically inhibited using shRNA against ATG5 shATG5 . Co-treatment of 3MA or CQ did not further enhance cell death following propionate exposure in cells with ATG5 knockdown , as shown in Figure 7c and g and Supplementary Figure S6e and f . Hence , the ability of 3-MA and CQ to potentiate propionate-induced cell death is based on their inhibition of autophagy . Discussion The antitumor activities of SCFAs , especially butyrate , in colon cancer have been extensively studied.32 The data presented here demonstrate the autophagy is induced by propionate . Autophagy serves as an adaptive response as cotreatment with autophagy inhibitors or expression of shRNA directed against ATG5 7 augmented propionate-induced cell death . Our data suggest that autophagy is an adaptive strategy allowing for augmented resistance to apoptotic stimuli triggered by SCFAs in colon cancer cells . Autophagy is activated in response to various stress stimuli , including starvation , hypoxia , endoplasmic reticulum stress and oxidative stress . In this study , autophagy induction was dependent on downregulation of its negative regulator mTOR , inactivation of which was linked to hyper-phosphorylation of the AMPKa . In addition to increased AMP ATP ratio , ROS serve as signaling molecules to activate AMPK.25 In this study , the ATP depletion and ROS accumulation may jointly initiate AMPK activation . SCFAs are oxidized through b-oxidation to provide an alternative energy source for colonocytes , which may account for the transient ATP upregulation 1�7 h . Subsequently , a drop of cellular ATP occurred after 7 h , which preceded the initiation of the extensive mitochondria membrane potential loss 12 h Figure 4cii . The observed early-stage 7�12 h ATP deple-tion might be explained by the enhanced ATP consumption due to increased Na ? HCO3 cotransporter NBC and the Na ? H ? exchanger NHE activities after SCFAs treat-ment.12 Through autophagic degradation of cellular orga-nelles and cytoplasmic content , autophagy enables the cells to recycle amino acids and nutrients to maintain protein synthesis and ATP generation , thereby sustaining bioenergetic homeostasis and cell survival.33 The direct evidence addressing the role of autophagy in ATP recovery is that abrogation of autophagy induction by ATG5 knockdown or blockage of autophagic degradation by CQ precipitated propionate-induced ATP depletion Supplementary Figure S7 and 5 . On the basis of these results , we reasoned that autophagy induced in response to propionate might provide the tumor cell with an alternative source of metabolic requirements to allow for adaptive protein synthesis and help overcome the cellular energy crisis caused by mitochondrial defects . Autophagy promotes cell survival , not only by recycling cellular constituents to sustain bioenergetics , but also functions as a cytoplasmic quality control mechanism by liquidating damaged organelles and protein aggregates , whose accumulation following cellular stress can be cyto-toxic.34 Autophagy also assumes an increasingly recognized role in cellular homeostasis control during hypoxia by 24 hours 48 hours HCT116 removing mitochondria that might otherwise become cyto-toxic.35 In this study , flow cytometry analysis provided strong evidence suggesting a correlation between MPT induction , loss of Dc Figure 4 , increased ROS generation Supple-mentary Figure S8 and autophagy targeting malfunctioning mitochondrial degradation in that propionate induced a loss of Dc Figures 4 and 5 . These results emphasize the role of the mitochondrial depolarization as a key event in mitochondrial autophagy and strengthen the idea that the mitochondrial permeability transition is a determinant of mitophagy . As two mechanistically distinct programmed cell deaths , autophagy and apoptosis can be induced simultaneously , sequentially , or in a mutually exclusive manner in response to cellular stresses.36,37 Mitochondria may be central organelles inte-grating the two types of cell death in which the mitochondrial permeability transition has been proposed to designate the cell�s destiny by adopting either autophagy or apoptosis.38 Autophagic degradation of defective mitochondria could retard the occurrence of apoptosis by circumventing the release of proapoptotic factors , which impedes the activation of the apoptotic cascade . Propionate and butyrate have been reported to have histone deacetylase HDAC inhibition activities.39 Treatment of the cells with Trichostatin A TSA , a well-known histone deacetylase inhibitor , failed to mimic the propionate-induced autophagic responses Supplementary FigureS9 . The link between diet and cancer is complex and difficult to unravel . The relevance of SCFAs , the major bacterial fermentation product of fibers , to cancer is manifold . SCFAs have been reported as antitumor agents that selectively induce differentiation , growth arrest and apoptosis in colon cancer cells.3,13,32 The results presented suggest that spontaneously-induced autophagy by SCFAs would increase the resistance and flexibility of colon cancer toward an adverse microenvironment and compromise the efficacy of SCFAs themselves in colon cancer prevention . Although we have yet to examine SCFAs chloroquine combination therapy in vivo , chloroquine has emerged as an anticancer autophagy modulator in a number of in vivo models . Perhaps most important is the fact that our study provides a proof of principle for enhancing the antitumor activities of SCFAs by modulation of autophagic pathways . Combination regimens including CQ or drugs targeting other steps in the autophagy pathway with ATG5 high-fiber containing food may be a feasible and promising therapeutic option for colon cancer treatment .

20977550	Introduction The protein p97 , also known as valosin-containing protein VCP in mammals , CDC-48 in Caenorhabditis elegans and Cdc48p in yeast , belongs to the AAA ATPases associated with diverse cellular activities family and is evolutionarily conserved in eukaryotes Woodman 2003 . p97 plays important roles in a wide variety of diverse cellular processes , including homotypic membrane fusion Latterich et al. 1995 Rabouille et al. 1995 , nuclear envelope reassembly Hetzer et al. 2001 Ramadan et al. 2007 , cell cycle regulation Moir et al. 1982 Mouysset et al. 2008 , endoplasmic reticulum�associated degradation Ye et al. 2001 Braun et al. 2002 Rabinovich et al. 2002 , the ubiquitin�proteasome system Dai Li 2001 , and preventing polyglutamine aggregation Higashiyama et al. 2002 Yamanaka et al. 2004 Kobayashi et al . 2007 . The underlying molecular function of p97 in these processes is believed to be as a segregase . p97 converts chemical energy generated from ATP hydro-lysis into mechanical force used for protein conforma-tional changes such as unfolding of proteins and disassembly of protein complexes Patel Latterich 1998 Rape et al. 2001 Braun et al. 2002 . p97 is composed of an amino-terminal N domain and two AAA ATPase domains termed D1 and D2 and forms a hexameric double-ring complex Rouiller et al. 2002 DeLaBarre Brunger 2003 . Several cofactors bind to the N domain and regulate the multiple functions of p97 . The Ufd1-Npl4 heterodimer binds to the N domain of p97 and accelerates the degradation of ubiquitylated proteins in the ubiquitin�proteasome system Rape et al. 2001 Ye et al. 2003 . Another cofactor , p47 , a member of the family of UBX ubiquitin regulatory X domain�containing proteins , binds the N domain of p97 and the resulting complex plays an important role in nonproteolytic regulation of homotypic membrane fusion Kondo et al. 1997 Buchberger et al. 2001 . The UBX domain is composed of approximately 80 amino acid residues . UBX domain�containing proteins are found in all eukaryotes Buchberger et al. 2001 Schuberth Buchberger 2008 . The three-dimensional structure of the UBX domain resembles that of ubiquitin Buchberger et al. 2001 Dreveny et al. 2004 Yuan et al. 2004 . The UBX domain directly interacts with p97 at a hydrophobic pocket in the N domain Dreveny et al. 2004 , and recent reports have showed that UBX family members are the largest group of general cofactors for p97 Schu-berth et al. 2004 . However , the cellular functions of UBX family proteins have not yet been elucidated , especially in multicellular organisms . Caenorhabditis elegans is the simplest multicellular model animal and is a powerful tool for the analysis of developmental processes . C. elegans has two p97 homologues , CDC-48.1 and CDC-48.2 collectively CDC-48.1 ? -48.2 , and embryogenesis depends on the function of at least one of these homologues Yamanaka et al. 2004 . CDC-48.1 ? -48.2 also play important roles in endoplasmic reticulum�associated degradation , cell cycle regulation in S-phase , extraction of Aurora B kinase from chromatin , germ-line devel-opment , and progression through meiotic metaphase I Mouysset et al. 2006 , 2008 Ramadan et al. 2007 Sasagawa et al. 2007a , b , c , 2009 . The UFD-1-NPL-4 cofactor is required for CDC-48.1 ? -48.2 function in most of these processes Mouysset et al. 2006 , 2008 Ramadan et al. 2007 Sasagawa et al. 2007c , 2009 . Our previous systematic expression analysis showed that the differential expression of UBX proteins in C. elegans is regulated spatiotemporally Yamauchi et al. 2007 . However , the cellular functions of UBX family proteins remain unclear . In this study , we found that the C. elegans UBXN UBX domain�con-taining protein in nematode proteins UBXN-1 , UBXN-2 and UBXN-3 bound to the N domain of CDC-48.1 ? -48.2 and localized in spermatocytes . We propose that C. elegans UBXN-1 , UBXN-2 and UBXN-3 positively regulate spermatogenesis via the degradation of TRA-1A the terminal effector of the sex determination pathway . Results All UBXN proteins directly interact with CDC-48.1 ? -48.2 Caenorhabditis elegans possesses six UBXN proteins , UBXN-1 to UBXN-6 Fig. 1A . To investigate whether UBXN proteins are cofactors for CDC-48.1 ? -48.2 , we analyzed the interaction between UBXN proteins and CDC-48.1 ? -48.2 using yeast two-hybrid analysis . Full-length UBXN-1 , UBXN-2 , UBXN-3 , UBXN-5 and UBXN-6 interacted with full-length CDC-48.1 ? -48.2 , whereas full-length UBXN-4 did not Table 1 and Fig. S1 in Supporting Information . Using the topological prediction pro-gram TMHMM version 2.0 http www.cbs.dtu.dk services TMHMM , we found that UBXN-4 con-tains a putative transmembrane TM segment adja-cent to the UBX domain Fig. 1A . It is therefore possible that the putative TM segment disrupted the interaction in this assay . Indeed , truncated UBXN-4 lacking the C-terminal region including the putative TM segment UBXN-4DTM interacted with both CDC-48.1 ? -48.2 Table 1 and Fig. S1 in Supporting Information . These results show that all six C. elegans UBXN proteins interact with CDC-48.1 ? -48.2 . CDC-48.1 ? -48.2 are comprised of the N domain , two AAA domains D1 and D2 and the conserved C-terminal DDDLY motif Fig. 1B . The three-dimensional structure of the UBX domain resembles that of ubiquitin , and the UBX domain interacts with the N domain of p97 Dreveny et al. 2004 . We found that the UBX domain in UBXN-3 UBXN-3UBX interacted with CDC-48.1 ? -48.2 Table 1 and Fig. S1 in Supporting Information . Furthermore , truncated CDC-48.1 ? -48.2 lacking the N domain CDC-48.1DN and CDC-48.2DN did not interact with UBXN-1 , UBXN-2 , UBXN-3 , UBXN-3UBX , UBXN-4DTM or UBXN-5 Table 1 and Fig. S1 in Supporting Information . These results imply that UBXN-1 through UBXN-5 interact with the N domain of CDC-48.1 ? -48.2 and that they may func-tion as N-terminal cofactors for CDC-48.1 ? -48.2 . In contrast , UBXN-6 still interacted with CDC-48.1DN and CDC-48.2DN Table 1 and Fig. S1 in Supporting Information , suggesting that UBXN-6 interacts with CDC-48.1 ? -48.2 via a domain other than the N domain . UBXN-6 contains a PUB peptide N-glycanase ? ubiquitin-associated or UBX-containing proteins domain in addition to the UBX domain Fig. 1A . Mammalian PUB domains from peptide N-glycanase and Ufd3 interact with the C-terminal TM UBX 432 aa DDDLY motif of p97 Zhao et al. 2007 , and thus , peptide N-glycanase and Ufd3 are C-terminal cofactors for p97 . C. elegans CDC-48.1 ? -48.2 also contain the highly conserved DDDLY motif at their C-termini Fig. 1B . A C. elegans Ufd3 homologue , UFD-3 C05C10.6 , interacted with CDC-48.1 , CDC-48.2 , CDC-48.1DN and CDC-48.2DN , but it did not interact with CDC-48.1DDDD803NNNN , CDC-48.2DDDD804NNNN , CDC-48.1Y808E or CDC-48.2Y809E mutants Table 1 and Fig. S2 in Supporting Information , indicating that UFD-3 interacts with CDC-48.1 ? -48.2 at the C-terminal con-served motif and acts as a C-terminal cofactor for CDC-48.1 ? -48.2 . Interestingly , although UBXN-6 interacted with CDC-48.1DN , CDC-48.2DN , CDC - 48.1DDDD803NNNN , CDC-48.2DDDD804NNNN , CDC - 48.1Y808E and CDC-48.2Y809E mutants , it did not interact with CDC-48.1DN , Y808E or CDC-48.2DN , Y809E Table 1 and Fig. S2 in Supporting Information . These results suggest that UBXN-6 interacts with the N domain as well as the C-terminal DDDDLY motif of CDC-48.1 ? -48.2 . Table 1 Summary of yeast two-hybrid assays To confirm the direct interaction between UBXN proteins and CDC-48.1 ? -48.2 in vitro , we carried out a pull-down assay using purified proteins . GST-fused UBXN proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified . GST-UBXN-5 could not be purified because of protein aggregation . Purified His-tagged CDC-48.1 ? -48.2 Nishikori et al. 2008 and GST-fused UBXN proteins were mixed and pulled down using affinity beads for GST proteins . Unconjugated GST proteins did not interact with CDC-48.1 ? -48.2 Fig. 2 . All UBXN proteins directly interacted with CDC-48.1 ? -48.2 Fig. 2 , indicating that C. elegans UBXN family proteins are cofactors for CDC-48.1 ? -48.2 . UBXN-1 , UBXN-2 and UBXN-3 are involved in gametogenesis and embryogenesis To elucidate the cellular functions of UBXN pro-teins , we carried out RNAi experiments . Each dou-ble-stranded RNA dsRNA was injected into the body cavity of C. elegans N2 wild-type young adult hermaphrodites . Embryos laid by the worms at 12� 36 h after injection were pooled and observed . RNAi targeting of each individual ubxn gene did not lead to any obvious phenotype e.g . embryonic lethality , lar-val lethality , morphogenesis defects or sterility Fig. 3 and data not shown . These results are consistent with an exhaustive RNAi study that also showed that the depletion of individual ubxn genes did not yield a detectable phenotype Sonnichsen et al. 2005 . We next injected a mixture of dsRNAs for all ubxn genes kDa marker I P I P I P I P I P I P 120 WB CDC-48.1 100 120 * 100 80 * * * * 60 50 WB GST * 25 120 100 WB CDC-48.2 50 WB GST into wild-type worms . We found that simultaneous RNAi of all ubxn genes conferred approximately 50 % embryonic lethality Fig. 3 . The remaining 50 % of embryos hatched and grew into adult worms , but 50 % of these F1 escapers were sterile Fig. 3 . When we omitted the dsRNA for ubxn-5 , embryonic lethality and sterility were the same as that assessed with the mixture of all the ubxn dsRNAs . When we further omitted the dsRNA for either ubxn-4 or ubxn-6 , they were the same as that assessed with the mixture of all the ubxn dsRNAs . In contrast , when we omitted the dsRNA for either ubxn-1 , ubxn-2 or ubxn-3 , both lethality and sterility were dramatically reduced Table S1 in Supporting Information . We found that simultaneous RNAi of ubxn-1 , ubxn-2 and ubxn-3 induced approximately 50 % embryonic lethal-ity and 60 % progeny sterility , a phenotype similar to that observed with simultaneous RNAi of all ubxn genes . Importantly , embryonic lethality and sterility were again dramatically reduced when dsRNA for either ubxn-1 , ubxn-2 or ubxn-3 was omitted Fig. 3 . Note that these phenotypes were observed only when using the microinjection procedure , and not by feed-ing the dsRNAs to the worms . To examine whether simultaneous RNAi of ubxn-1 , ubxn-2 and ubxn-3 effectively depleted the expres-sion of all three proteins , we first generated individual antibodies against UBXN-1 , UBXN-2 and UBXN-3 . The calculated molecular masses of UBXN-1 , UBXN-2 and UBXN-3 are approximately 32.9 kDa , 32.6 kDa and 71.7 kDa , respectively . Using Western blotting , anti-UBXN-1 and anti-UBXN-2 antibodies detected single bands at 39 kDa and 36 kDa , respec-tively , whereas two bands of 72 kDa and 85 kDa were detected by anti-UBXN-3 antibody Fig. S3 in Supporting Information see Discussion . Signals for the corresponding bands were significantly reduced in RNAi-treated worms and in the deletion mutants Fig. S3 in Supporting Information . Furthermore , in simultaneously knocked down worms , the amounts of UBXN-1 , UBXN-2 and UBXN-3 were greatly reduced Fig . S3 in Supporting Information , suggest-ing that our RNAi strategy was effective . Taken together , these results suggest that UBXN-1 , UBXN-2 and UBXN-3 are involved in gametogenesis and embryogenesis . UBXN-1 , UBXN-2 and UBXN-3 cooperatively control spermatogenesis in hermaphrodites We previously reported that CDC-48.1 ? -48.2-depleted or UFD-1-depleted worms are sterile , which is caused by a defect in germ-line development Sasagawa et al. 2007c Fig. 4 . UFD-1 forms a heterodimer with NPL-4 and is a well-characterized cofactor for p97 ? CDC-48 Meyer et al. 2000 Bruderer et al. 2004 Mouysset et al. 2006 . In addition , simultaneous RNAi of UBXN-1 , UBXN-2 and UBXN-3 [ hereafter referred to as ubxn-1 ? -2 ? -3 RNAi ] resulted in the progeny sterility as shown in Fig. 3 . Thus , we next analyzed their dissected gonads . We found that germ-line development appeared normal in ubxn-1 ? -2 ? -3 RNAi worms Fig. 4 . These results indicate that CDC-48.1 ? -48.2 and their cofactor UFD-1-NPL-4 are essential for germ-line development , but the cofactors UBXN-1 , UBXN-2 and UBXN-3 are not . Furthermore , whereas the depletion of CDC-48.1 ? -48.2 or UFD-1 induces the unfolded protein response Sasagawa et al. 2007c , ubxn-1 ? -2 ? -3 RNAi did not data not shown .

Finally , self-fertilized eggs are produced using sperm and oocytes in the adult stage . Interestingly , fertilized eggs were not observed in the uterus of ubxn-1 ? -2 ? -3 RNAi worms Fig. 5A , although their germ-line development appeared normal Fig. 4 . Furthermore , oocytes were tightly stacked in these sterile worms Fig. 5A , which is a typical phenotype observed in worms that do not have sperm Shimada et al. 2006 . Indeed , sperm were not observed in spermathecae of these sterile worms Fig. 5A . In addition , major sperm protein MSP , which is a marker of sperm Ward 1987 , was also not observed in spermathecae Fig. 5B . These characteristics were consistent with a feminization of germ-line FOG phenotype , in which the germ-line produces only oocytes and not sperm . Interestingly , ubxn-1 ? -2 ? -3 RNAi males produced sperm normally Fig. 5A . Furthermore , after crossing with ubxn-1 ? -2 ? -3 RNAi males , the ubxn-1 ? -2 ? -3 RNAi hermaphrodites started to produce fertilized eggs Fig. 5A . These results indicate that UBXN-1 , UBXN-2 and UBXN-3 are specifically involved in spermatogenesis in hermaphrodites . We previously reported that CDC-48.1 ? -48.2 and the UFD-1-NPL-4 cofactor are required for both germ-line develop-ment and spermatogenesis Sasagawa et al. 2007c , 2009 . Deletion of either CDC-48.1 or CDC-48.2 causes decreased sperm production Sasagawa et al. 2009 . These results together imply that the CDC-48.1 ? -48.2 complexes containing UBXN-1 , UBXN-2 and UBXN-3 positively regulate spermatogenesis . UBXN-1 , UBXN-2 and UBXN-3 are expressed in spermatogenesis We previously examined the spatial and temporal expression patterns of ubxn genes using GFP transla-tional fusion constructs Yamauchi et al. 2007 . UBXN-1 GFP , UBXN-2 GFP and UBXN-3 GFP are all expressed in embryos and spermathecae . How-ever , the expression of the GFP reporter from extra-chromosomal arrays is generally suppressed in gonads because of the silencing mechanism . To precisely investigate the localization of UBXN-1 , UBXN-2 and UBXN-3 in gonads , we carried out a cytological analysis using the antibodies shown in Fig. S3 in Sup-porting Information . As described above , sperm are generated at the early L4 stage in C. elegans hermaph-rodites Kimble Crittenden 2007 . Dissected gonads from wild-type hermaphrodites at the early L4 stage were fixed and stained with each of the anti-UBXN proteins antibodies and with anti-MSP antibody . MSP was localized in spermatogenic germ cells and mature sperm white-lined region in Fig. 6A . UBXN-1 , UBXN-2 and UBXN-3 were relatively strongly expressed in proximal gonads where MSP is localized , although UBXN-1 , UBXN-2 and UBXN-3 were ubiquitously localized in the gonads Fig. 6A . More precisely , UBXN-1 , UBXN-2 and UBXN-3 primarily localized at the periphery of spermatocyte nuclei , but not in mature sperm white arrows in high-magnification images in Fig. 6A . Importantly , UBXN-1 , UBXN-2 and UBXN-3 colocalized with CDC-48 at the periphery of spermatocyte nuclei Fig. 6B . These results suggest that UBXN-1 , UBXN-2 and UBXN-3 together with CDC-48.1 ? -48.2 are involved in spermatogenesis , but not in the maintenance of mature sperm . UBXN-3 binds to the CDC-48-UFD-1-NPL-4 complex in vivo We showed a direct interaction between CDC-48.1 ? -48.2 and UBXN-1 , UBXN-2 and UBXN-3 proteins in vitro as shown in Fig. 2 . We also showed A Hermaphrodite Spermatheca B the evidence of genetic interaction between ubxn-1 , ubxn-2 and ubxn-3 and cdc-48 Table S1 in Support-ing Information . Embryonic lethality and progeny sterility of depletion of ubxn-1 , ubxn-2 or ubxn-3 were dramatically enhanced in the cdc-48.1 tm544 or cdc-48.2 tm659 background . To investigate their in vivo interaction , we carried out a pull-down assay using lysates from the XA7203 strain , which expresses FLAG-tagged CDC-48.1 under the control of its own promoter and 3� untranslated region Sasagawa et al. 2009 . When lysates were treated with anti-FLAG M2 affinity gels , FLAG-tagged CDC-48.1 was precipitated Fig. 7 . We found that UBXN-3 and UFD-1 coprecipitated with FLAG-tagged CDC-48.1 Fig. 7 , suggesting that UBXN-3 and UFD-1 interact with FLAG-tagged CDC-48.1 in vivo . In contrast , UBXN-1 and UBXN-2 did not coprecipi-tate with FLAG-tagged CDC-48.1 , or amounts of precipitated UBXN-1 and UBXN-2 were below the detectable levels , under the experimental conditions we used Fig. 7 . This might reflect that the associa-tion of UBXN-1 and UBXN-2 to CDC-48 is weak and transient . It is also possible that binding affinity of UBXN-1 and UBXN-2 to CDC-48 becomes much weaker when other cofactors coexist . It is important to mention that when compared with the amount of UFD-1 coprecipitated with FLAG-tagged CDC-48.1 , only a small amount of UBXN-3 copre-cipitated Fig. 7 , suggesting that CDC-48 interacts with UFD-1 much stronger than UBXN proteins . Considering that functional diversity of CDC-48 is mainly determined by differential binding of distinct cofactors , it seems reasonable that the binding of UBXN proteins to CDC-48 is not stable in vivo . Alternatively , an unknown factor or modification such as phosphorylation , acetylation or ubiquitylation on UBXN proteins and ? or CDC-48 may be involved in the regulation of interaction between UBXN proteins and CDC-48 positively and ? or neg-atively . It is also possible that the interaction between UBXN proteins and CDC-48 is regulated spatiotem-porally in vivo . However , this issue remains elusive see Discussion . As described earlier , UFD-1 forms a heterodimer with NPL-4 Meyer et al. 2000 Bruderer et al. 2004 Mouysset et al. 2006 , and UFD-1-NPL-4 and UBXN-3 are N-terminal cofactors for CDC-48.1 ? -48.2 . UBXN-3 does not interact with UFD-1 and NPL-4 in a yeast two-hybrid assay Sasagawa et al. 2009 . p97 forms a ring-shaped homo-hexamer Rouiller et al. 2002 DeLaBarre Brunger 2003 . Therefore , one hexamer has six N-domains , and dif-ferent N-terminal cofactors can bind to each of the six p97 monomers in the hexamer Rumpf Jentsch 2006 Jentsch Rumpf 2007 . To elucidate whether A UBXN-1 UBXN-2 UBXN-3 DAPI UBXN MSP Merge High-magnification images of white-lined region Sp SpCyt Sp SpCyt Sp SpCyt DAPI UBXN MSP Merge Merge B UBXN-1 UBXN-2 UBXN-3 DAPI UBXN Merge UFD-1-NPL-4 and UBXN-3 bind simultaneously to CDC-48.1 ? -48.2 , we prepared the strain XA7205 , which expresses C-terminally FLAG-tagged NPL-4.1 . FLAG-tagged NPL-4.1 was efficiently precipitated using anti-FLAG M2 affinity gels Fig. 7 . Both UFD-1 and UBXN-3 coprecipitated with FLAG-tagged NPL-4.1 Fig. 7 , strongly suggesting that UFD-1-NPL-4 and UBXN-3 bind simultaneously to CDC-48.1 ? -48.2 . UBXN-1 , UBXN-2 and UBXN-3 are involved in sex determination The sex determination system plays an important role in spermatogenesis in C. elegans . TRA-1A is the termi-nal effector of the sex determination pathway and inhibits spermatogenesis Hodgkin 1987 Zarkower Hodgkin 1992 Ellis Schedl 2006 . The tra-1 e1099 loss-of-function mutant shows the masculinization of germ-line phenotype , in which the germ-line produces only sperm frequency 20 of 20 analyzed . As shown in Fig. 5 , ubxn-1 ? -2 ? -3 RNAi worms showed the FOG phenotype . In contrast , when the tra-1 e1099 mutant was targeted for RNAi by ubxn-1 ? -2 ? -3 RNAi , all progeny showed the masculinization of germ-line phenotype frequency 20 of 20 analyzed , implying that the tra-1 e1099 mutation completely suppressed the FOG phenotype caused by ubxn-1 ? -2 ? -3 RNAi . These results indicate that UBXN-1 , UBXN-2 and UBXN-3 are involved in sex determination in C. elegans . TRA-1A is degraded by the CUL-2 ubiquitin ligase complex , which contains FEM-1 , FEM-2 and FEM-3 Starostina et al. 2007 . TRA-1A accumulates control NPL-4.1 control NPL-4.1 FLAG FLAG marker 120 100 FLAG CDC-48.1 [ unc-119 + ] , XA7203 unc-119 ed3 cdc-48.1 tm544 qaIs7201 [ Pcdc-48.1-FLAG CDC-48.1 , unc-119 + ] and XA7205 unc-119 ed3 qaIs7202 [ Pnpl-4.1-NPL-4.1 FLAG , unc-119 + ] . The XA7203 and XA7205 strains express FLAG CDC-48.1 and NPL-4.1 FLAG , respectively . The XA7200 strain was used as a negative control . All strains were incubated at 25 ? C . approximately 4.8-fold compared to wild type in the fem-3 loss-of-function mutant that shows the FOG phenotype Starostina et al. 2007 Fig. 8 . We found that TRA-1A accumulated approximately 4.7-fold in ubxn-1 ? -2 ? -3 RNAi worms compared to wild type . We previously reported that CDC-48.1 ? -48.2 also play an important role in TRA-1A degradation by interacting with the CUL-2 complex Sasagawa et al. 2009 . These results suggest that UBXN-1 , UBXN-2 and UBXN-3 , which are N-terminal cofactors for CDC-48.1 ? -48.2 , positively regulate spermatogenesis via TRA-1A degradation . marker wild-type worms . The temperature-sensitive mutant fem-3 e2006 was incubated at 25 ? C beginning at the embryo stage and showed the feminization of germ-line FOG phenotype at the adult stage . FOG worms n 100 , which appeared following the simultaneous knockdown of UBXN-1 , UBXN-2 and UBXN-3 , were dissolved in sample buffer . Equal amounts of extracted protein from each type of worm at the adult stage were loaded . Signals were detected with anti-TRA-1A and anti-actin antibodies . We detected a 114-kDa band that was TRA-1A . The amounts of TRA-1A and actin were quantified using IMAGE GAURAGE software , and relative intensities of the bands in the various lanes are shown below each lane . We previously reported that CDC-48 controls the sperm�oocyte switch by regulating CUL-2-mediated TRA-1A proteasome degradation Sasagawa et al. 2009 . RPN-10 is a component of the 19S regulatory particle of proteasomes , recognizes poly-ubiquitin chains and delivers poly-ubiquitylated substrates to the 20S proteasome Shimada et al. 2006 . We there-fore asked if UBXN-1 , UBXN-2 and UBXN-3 are involved in the ubiquitin�proteasome system . We found that UBXN-3 bound directly and strongly to K48-linked poly-ubiquitin chains Ub2�7 Fig. 9A , B . It has been reported that human FAF1 , a homologue of C. elegans UBXN-3 , binds to poly-ubiquitin chains through its N-terminal UBA domain Song et al. 2005 . Therefore , it is possible that the UBA-like domain of UBXN-3 may be responsible for poly-ubiquitin WB kDa I P I P I P I P 28 14 B AU 2 Ub quantity 100 Relative 50 RNAi control ubxn-1 -2 -3 RNAi rpn-10 RNAi and ubxn-1 ? -2 ? -3 RNAi rpn-10 RNAi , 100 % 80 ? 80 . binding . Weak but significant binding to poly-ubiquitin was observed for UBXN-1 and UBXN-2 , while GST alone did not bind Fig. 9A , B . These results suggest that UBXN-1 , UBXN-2 and UBXN-3 are able to bind to the protein degradation signals . We then analyzed if ubiquitin�proteasome system is involved in spermatogenesis . The simultaneous treat - ment with ubxn-1 ? -2 ? -3 RNAi and rpn-10 RNAi induced a complete FOG phenotype compared to the individual knockdown Fig. 9C . These results suggest that UBXN-1 , UBXN-2 and UBXN-3 interact with RPN-10 genetically and that ubiquitin�proteasome system plays an important role in spermatogenesis . Discussion In this study , we showed that all of the six C. elegans UBXN proteins are cofactors for CDC-48.1 ? -48.2 UBXN-1-5 are N-terminal cofactors and interestingly UBXN-6 is an N-terminal as well as C-terminal co-factor for CDC-48.1 ? -48.2 . Recent reports have also shown that UBXD1 , a human homologue of UBXN-6 , binds to the N domain and C-terminal motif of p97 Madsen et al. 2008 Kern et al. 2009 , which is consistent with our results . However , Kern et al. 2009 showed that the UBX domain of UBXD1 is not involved in the binding to p97 , and instead the N-terminal domain of UBXD1 is responsible for the binding to the N domain of p97 . The UBX domain binds through a highly conserved R�FPR motif of exposed side chains to the N domain of p97 Dreveny et al. 2004 . Because key residues within the R�FPR motif are not conserved in UBXD1 homologues including UBXN-6 , the UBX domain of UBXD1 is considered not to contribute to the binding to p97 Madsen et al. 2008 data not shown . Therefore , which domain of UBXN-6 is responsible for the binding to the N domain of CDC-48.1 ? -48.2 remains unknown . Although RNAi targeting of each individual ubxn gene did not lead to any obvious phenotype , RNAi combination of ubxn-1 , ubxn-2 and ubxn-3 caused sterile and embryonic lethal . We found that the sterile hermaphrodites showed the FOG phenotype in which the germ-line develops normally but produces only oocytes and not sperm . Males produced sperm normally even when all three proteins were simulta-neously knocked down . CDC-48.1 ? -48.2 are also involved in spermatogenesis in hermaphrodites , but not in male Sasagawa et al. 2009 . UBXN-1 , UBXN-2 and UNXN-3 colocalized with CDC-48.1 ? -48.2 at the periphery of spermatocyte nuclei . Furthermore , immunoprecipitation IP analysis using C. elegans lysates showed that at least UBXN-3 inter-acted with CDC-48 in vivo . These results indicate that UBXN-1 , UBXN-2 and UBXN-3 together with CDC-48.1 ? -48.2 are cooperatively involved in hermaphrodite-specific spermatogenesis . How can cdc-48.1 tm544 mutants develop sperm cells , while ubxn-1 ? -2 ? -3 RNAi hermaphrodites do not , if UBXN proteins cooperate with CDC-48 ? It should be emphasized that C. elegans possesses two CDC-48 homologues , namely CDC-48.1 and CDC-48.2 , whose functions are essential and redundant Yamanaka et al. 2004 , and that both CDC-48.1 and CDC-48.2 are involved in spermatogenesis Sasagawa et al. 2009 . UBXN-1 , UBXN-2 and UNXN-3 are essential for spermatogenesis as cofactors of CDC-48.1 ? -48.2 . Therefore , sperm cells can be developed in the cdc-48.1 tm544 deletion mutants , in which CDC-48.2 , UBXN-1 , UBXN-2 and UNXN-3 are fully functional . Thus , cdc-48.1 tm544 mutants develop sperm cells , whereas ubxn-1 ? -2 ? -3 RNAi hermaphrodites do not . We detected two forms of UBXN-3 . Based on the molecular size , the lower band 72 kDa may corre-spond to UBXN-3 calculated molecular mass 71.7 kDa , and the upper band 85 kDa may be a post-translationally modified UBXN-3 or an alterna-tively spliced form of UBXN-3 . Alternatively , con-sidering that both bands were detected by the anti-GST antibody in the case of N-terminally GST-fused UBXN-3 and that the lower band was not coprecipi-tated with CDC-48 , it is possible that the lower band might be generated by the truncation from the C-ter-minal end in which the UBX domain locates . At present , however , the biological significance of two forms of UBXN-3 remains elusive . The FOG phenotype was previously reported in rpn-10 tm1180 , fem-1 lf , fem-2 lf and fem-3 lf mutants Ellis Schedl 2006 Shimada et al. 2006 Kimble Crittenden 2007 . Recent reports have showed that spermatogenesis is positively regulated by the ubiqu-itin�proteasome system via degradation of the sex determination factors TRA-1A and TRA-2 Shimada et al. 2006 Starostina et al. 2007 Sasagawa et al. 2009 . RPN-10 , a component of the proteasome 19S regula-tory particle , is involved in the degradation of TRA-2 , which inhibits spermatogenesis Shimada et al. 2006 . FEM-1 , FEM-2 and FEM-3 form a complex with CUL-2 ? Cullin2 and function as an E3 ubiquitin ligase , which promotes TRA-1A ubiquitylation Starostina et al. 2007 . Subsequently , poly-ubiquitylated TRA-1A is recognized by RPN-10 and delivered to the 20S proteasome . Interestingly , TRA-1A accumulated in worms in which UBXN-1 , UBXN-2 and UNXN-3 had been simultaneously knocked down , and the tra-1 e1099 mutation completely suppressed the FOG phenotype caused by the simultaneous knockdown of UBXN-1 , UBXN-2 and UNXN-3 . In addition , UBXN-1 , UBXN-2 and UNXN-3 bound K48-linked poly-ubiquitin chains . These results indicate that UBXN-1 , UBXN-2 and UNXN-3 positively regulate spermatogenesis via the degradation of TRA-1A , which inhibits spermatogenesis . The p97-UBXD7 complex promotes turnover of HIF1a , a substrate for the Cullin2-based ubiquitin ligase Alexandru et al. 2008 . Our data suggest that UBXN-1 , UBXN-2 and UNXN-3 promote the deg-radation of TRA-1A , a substrate for the CUL-2-based ubiquitin ligase . These results show the possibility that CDC-48 equipped UBXN-1 , UBXN-2 and UNXN-3 is recruited to the CUL-2 ubiquitin ligase . Interest-ingly , we found that UBXN-3 , a homologue of human UBXD7 , bound to the CDC-48-UFD-1-NPL-4 com-plex , suggesting that the binding of UBXN-3 and UFD-1-NPL-4 to CDC-48 is not mutually exclusive . Previous reports have showed that yeast Ubx2 and Ufd1-Npl4 cofactors bind to Cdc48p in the same com-plex and that Ubx2 further regulates the function of Cdc48p-Ufd1-Npl4 Neuber et al. 2005 Schuberth Buchberger 2005 . Furthermore , human SAKS1 , p47 and UBXD7 also bind to the p97-Ufd1-Npl4 complex Alexandru et al. 2008 . Therefore , the binding of UBX proteins and Ufd1-Npl4 to p97 ? CDC-48 is evo-lutionarily well conserved . p97 in conjunction with Ufd1-Npl4 has been found to be involved in several different ubiquitin-dependent processes and nuclear membrane reconstitution Bays et al. 2001 Hetzer et al. 2001 Rape et al. 2001 Ye et al. 2001 Braun et al. 2002 Jarosch et al. 2002 Rabinovich et al. 2002 Mouysset et al. 2006 Ramadan et al. 2007 Sasagawa et al. 2007c . UBX proteins can cooperate with the Ufd1-Npl4 cofactor on the same p97 hexamer . In C. elegans , the depletion of UFD-1 and NPL-4 resulted in embryonic lethality , whereas that of UBXN-3 did not . Even in the L1 feeding RNAi experiment , deple-tion of UFD-1 and NPL-4 resulted in the defective germ-line development Sasagawa et al. 2007c . UFD-1-NPL-4 is a well-known CDC-48 cofactor Mouysset et al. 2006 and is coprecipitated with CDC-48 very efficiently . These results indicate that UFD-1-NPL-4 plays crucial roles in CDC-48 function . Therefore , CDC-48-UFD-1-NPL-4 would be a core complex , and binding of one or some of UBXN proteins to this complex may diversify and specify the function of CDC-48 , or regulate the activity of the CDC-48-UFD-1-NPL-4 complex . Recently , we found that ELC-1 ? Elongin C , which is an adaptor of CUL-2 , interacts directly with NPL-4 but not with UFD-1 , UBXN-1 , UBXN-2 or UBXN-3 Sasagawa et al. 2009 . Human UBXN homologues also assemble with Cullin2 together with p97 and Ufd1-Npl4 Alexandru et al. 2008 . These results suggest that p97 ? CDC-48 and UBX ? UBXN cofactors are recruited to the Cul-lin2 ? CUL-2 ubiquitin ligase via interactions between ELC-1 ? Elongin C and NPL-4 ? Npl4 . How UBXN cofactors cooperate with the UFD-1-NPL-4 cofactor and how p97 ? CDC-48 complexes containing UBXN cofactors cooperate with E3 ligases , however , remain to be addressed . Experimental procedures Caenorhabditis elegans strains and general methods In this study , we used C. elegans N2 wild-type worms and the mutant strains FX2759 ubxn-1 tm2759 , VC1450 ubxn-2 ok1942 IV ? nT1 [ qIs51 ] , CB3844 fem-3 e2006lf , CB2590 tra-1 e1099 ? dpy-18 e1096 , HT1593 unc-119 ed3 , XA7200 unc-119 ed3 qaIs7200 [ unc-119 + ] and XA7203 unc-119 ed3 cdc-48.1 tm544 qaIs7201 [ Pcdc-48.1-FLAG CDC-48.1 , unc - 119 + ] . FX2759 was provided by Dr. S. Mitani Tokyo Women�s Medical University , and VC1450 , CB3844 , CB2590 and HT1593 were provided by the Caenorhabditis Genetics Center . To exclude unexpected additional mutations , deletion mutants were out-crossed five times . XA7200 and XA7203 have been described Sasagawa et al. 2009 . npl-4.1 with a 1-kb 5�-upstream region and 1-kb 3�-untrans-lated region was PCR amplified from wild-type genomic DNA and cloned into pHUNC1 , which contains wild-type unc-119 Sasagawa et al. 2009 . The DNA sequences encoding a FLAG tag were inserted immediately upstream of the translation termi-nation codon of npl-4.1 to produce a C-terminal fusion protein . The XA7205 unc-119 ed3 qaIs7202 [ Pnpl-4.1-NPL-4.1 FLAG , unc-119 + ] strain expressing NPL-4.1 FLAG protein was created using microparticle bombardment Praitis et al. 2001 . The general methods of culturing and handling C. elegans have been described Brenner 1974 . Nematode experiments were carried out at 20 ? C unless otherwise specified . Yeast two-hybrid assay Full-length cDNA fragments derived from cdc-48.1 , cdc-48.2 , ubxn-1 , ubxn-2 , ubxn-3 , ubxn-4 , ubxn-5 , ubxn-6 and ufd-3 were amplified from yk-clones or wild-type total RNAs . These cDNA fragments were cloned into plasmid pGADT7 or pGBKT7 Clontech . Mutations and deletions were created using the PrimeStar MAX mutagenesis kit TaKaRa . Result-ing plasmids were verified by DNA sequencing and were transformed into the Saccharomyces cerevisiae AH109 strain . Transformants were incubated on test plates lacking Leu , Trp , His and Ade at 30 ? C for 3 days . Pull-down assay and immunoprecipitation Full-length cDNA fragments derived from ubxn-1 , ubxn-2 , ubxn-3 , ubxn-4 , ubxn-5 and ubxn-6 were cloned into pDEST15 Invitrogen to create an N-terminal GST-fusion construct . The resulting plasmids were used to transform E. coli BL21 DE3 , and recombinant proteins were overproduced at 20 ? C and purified . Purified His6-tagged CDC-48.1 and CDC-48.2 were kindly provided by Dr. S. Nishikori Nishik-ori et al. 2008 . GST-fusion proteins 4 lg and CDC-48.1 ? -48.2 8 lg or K48-linked poly-ubiquitin 1 lg , Ub2�7 , Bos-ton Biochem were incubated in 500 lL of binding buffer 1 % v ? v Triton X-100 , 5 mM DTT , 20 % glycerol , 1 mM MgCl2 , 1 mM ATP in PBS . Glutathione Sepharose 4B GE Healthcare Bioscience was used in pull-down assays with GST proteins . Young adult worms 100 lg of strains XA7200 , XA7203 or XA7205 were dissolved in 1 mL of IP buffer 20 mM HE-PES , pH 7.5 , 150 mM NaCl , 50 mM NaF , 1 mM Na3VO4 , 1 mM ADP at 4 ? C. Anti-FLAG M2 affinity gels Sigma were incubated with blocking buffer 5 % polyvinylpyrrolidone K25 in 50 mM Tris�HCl , pH 8.0 overnight at 4 ? C. Worm lysates were incubated with 50 lL of treated anti-FLAG M2 affinity gels for 1 h at 4 ? C and then washed four times with wash buffer 20 mM HEPES , pH 7.5 , 150 mM NaCl , 0.1 % Triton X-100 for 2 min each . Finally , precipitants were extracted with 100 lL of IP buffer containing 1 mg ? mL of FLAG peptide Sigma as a competitor and analyzed with SDS-PAGE . RNA interference RNAi experiments To construct RNAi plasmids , full-length cDNA fragments of ubxn-1 , ubxn-2 , ubxn-3 , ubxn-4 , ubxn-5 and ubxn-6 were cloned into the pLITMUS28 plasmid New England BioLabs . Subsequently , we amplified each dsDNA from the resulting plasmids using the following primers L28Fw2442to2466 5�-AGCTACGTAATACGACTCACTAGTG-3� forward and L28Rv2603to2627 5�-CAGTCCGTAATACGACTCACTTA AG-3� reverse . The resulting dsDNA fragments , which con-tained the T7 promoter at both ends , were used as a template for in vitro dsRNA synthesis . The dsRNAs were synthesized in vitro with T7 RNA polymerase and purified . Finally , each dsRNA approximately 0.2 mg ? mL was microinjected into the body cavity of C. elegans hermaphrodites at the young adult stage . However , we knocked down cdc-48.1 , cdc-48.2 , ufd-1 and rpn-10 using the optimal feeding RNAi method Kamath et al. 2001 with RNAi plasmids Shimada et al. 2006 Sasagawa et al. 2007b , c . The RNAi construct for rpn-10 was a kind gift from Dr. H. Kawahara Shimada et al. 2006 . Antibody production and immunofluorescence Antibodies against full-length UBXN-1 , UBXN-2 , UBXN-3 and UFD-1 were generated . PCR-amplified full-length cDNA fragments of ubxn-1 , ubxn-2 , ubxn-3 and ufd-1 were cloned into the expression vector pCold I TaKaRa to make an N-terminal His6-tagged construct . The resulting plasmids were used to transform E. coli BL21 DE3 harboring the pG-Tf2 chaperone vector TaKaRa , and recombinant proteins were overproduced at 15 ? C and purified . Purified proteins were injected into rabbits using the standard method Iwaki Co. , Ltd. , and the antibodies produced were affinity purified . The following immunofluorescence experiments were car-ried out at 25 ? C unless otherwise specified . Gonads and sper-mathecae were dissected on a poly-L-lysine-coated slide glass , fixed with 2 % paraformaldehyde in PBSTw PBS containing 0.1 % Tween20 for 1 h , followed by prechilled 100 % dimethyl-formamide for 10 min . Fixed samples were rehydrated with PBSTw for 30 min and blocked with 3 % BSA in PBSTw for 1 h . The slides were incubated with antibody diluted in PBS containing 1 % BSA , 0.5 % Triton X-100 and 0.05 % sodium azide for 16 h at 4 ? C .

21072056	Programmed cell death or apoptosis is characterized by the activation of a class of proteases called caspases . Caspases are cysteine-dependent aspartic acid-specific proteases , which represent the executioners of apoptosis and are generally classified as either initiators or effectors . In mammalian cells , caspases are almost universally expressed as inactive zymogens , which must undergo proteolysis at an internal aspartate to produce the active form . Depending on the death-inducing signal , caspase activation and apoptosis occur via two distinct pathways intrinsic or extrinsic . Intrinsic apoptosis is triggered by a number of different cellular stresses that cause the release of apoptogenic factors from the mitochondrial intermembrane space into the cytosol.1,2 Mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization MOMP is regulated by the interplay between the BCL-2 family of proteins and requires BAX and or BAK activation.3,4 In contrast to intrinsic apoptosis , extrinsic apoptosis is initiated at the plasma membrane by stimulation of death receptors.5 Binding of a death ligand , such as Fas or tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand TRAIL , triggers receptor oligomerization and induces the binding of adapter molecules.6 These adapter molecules recruit caspase-8 to the receptor complex to form the death-inducing signalling complex DISC . Caspase-8 typically exists as a monomer in the cytosol , but upon DISC formation , it undergoes dimerization.7,8 The dimerization of two caspase-8 monomers p55 p55 results in the conformational change , which exposes the active site of the caspase through the so-called mechanism of �induced proximity�.7,9�11 Dimerization has been demonstrated to be sufficient for activation of caspase-8 , but it has been proposed that full activity requires self-cleavage.11�14 Caspase-8 initially cleaves itself between the p18 and p10 domains forming a heterodimer within a hetero-tetrameric complex p43-p10 p43-p10 See Figure 1a . This first cleavage is necessary for recognition of other substrates , such as effector caspases i.e. caspase-3 and the proapop-totic BCL-2 family member BID.12,13 p43-p10 p43-p10 can undergo a second cleavage between the p26 and p18 domains , which frees the heterotetramer p18-p10 p18-p10 from the DED domains but does reduce its activity.12 Extrinsic apoptosis can proceed along two different pathways , type I or type II , depending on the level of caspase-8 activation upon DISC formation.15 In type I cells , large amounts of DISC and active caspase-8 are formed that leads to the direct cleavage of effector caspases in the cytosol.16 In type II cells , there is slower DISC assembly and low production of active caspase-8.15 In this scenario , caspase-8 must engage the intrinsic mitochondrial pathway to amplify the death signal and execute apoptosis . The transition from the extrinsic path-way to the intrinsic pathway is achieved through caspase-8 processing of BID.17,18 Cleaved truncated BID , or tBID , interacts with other BCL-2 family members on the surface of the mitochondria , which results in MOMP . We had previously demonstrated that during type II extrinsic apoptosis caspase-8 becomes enriched on the mitochondrial surface , and that by blocking caspase-8 association with the mitochondria , we were able to inhibit the formation of p43-p10 , prevent BID cleavage and block apoptosis.19,20 However , the purpose of the insertion of active caspase-8 into the mitochondrial membrane remains unknown . In this study , we report that caspase-8 and BID form a native macromolecular complex on the mitochondria . Follow-ing Fas or TRAIL activation , tBID is formed within this complex by the caspase-8-mediated cleavage of BID and then shifts to a separate complex containing BAK and or BCL-XL . By concentrating BID and caspase-8 on the mitochondrial membrane , type II cells have established a mechanism by which low levels of proteolytically active caspase-8 would be able to specifically target sufficient amounts of BID on the organelle mitochondria where it is needed to induce MOMP . These findings further emphasize the important role of compartmentalization to the activation of caspases , such as is seen with the apoptosome and inflammasome.21,22 In summary , we have identified a mitochondria-associated triggering platform from which type II cells launch the mitochondrial phase of apoptosis . The generation of caspase-8 point mutants to study mitochondrial-dependent cell death . We hypothesized that point mutations that affect caspase-8 processing and activity might also influence the association of caspase-8 with the mitochondria . Figure 1a depicts a linear cartoon of caspase-8 showing the main functional domains . Caspase-8 is cleaved into three distinct fragments DED , p18 and p10 whose boundaries and molecular weights are labeled in Figure 1a . Five different mutant constructs were created that specifically targeted aspartate residues in the regions of the first and second cleavage sites of caspase-8 or the active cysteine Figure 1a . All constructs were tagged with GFP in order to examine localization and to distinguish exogenous from endogenous caspase-8 Figure 1a . We initially explored the cleavage patterns of the caspase-8-GFP point mutants . For that reason , HeLa cells , which stably expressed an shRNA against endogenous caspase-8 Supple-mentary Figure S1 , were transfected with the different caspase-8-GFP mutants . The formation of both p43 and p18 was evident in cells transfected with wt caspase-8 C8-GFP , or with caspase-8 mutated at the second cleavage site DM2-GFP or TM2-GFP , but not in cells transfected with caspase-8 mutated at the first cleavage site Figure 1b . Furthermore , the inactive caspase-8 mutant , C360S-GFP , displayed a strong inhibition of p43 and p18 formation , suggesting a defect in self-cleavage Figure 1b , lane 8 . Given the observed alterations in the cleavage pattern of the caspase-8 point mutants , we next sought to analyze their effects on the induction of cell death . Surprisingly , all caspase-8 mutants were capable of inducing cell death in control HeLa cells expressing a non-targeting shRNA shCont to a level similar to Fas treatment Figure 1c , black bars , despite the defects in autoprocessing noted in Figure 1b . It should be noted that , in the absence of death ligand , exogenous expression of caspase-8 induces its dimerization through a process termed �induced-proximity�.7,10,13 Importantly , caspase-8 was not highly overexpressed , and most trans-fected cells displayed a B2-fold increase in the total amount of caspase-8 Supplementary Figure S2a . It is likely that dimerization occurred between exogenously expressed inactive caspase-8 mutants DM1-GFP and C360S-GFP and endogenous caspase-8 . Indeed , the second cleavage product of caspase-8 , p18 , was observed in shCont cells transfected with the different active and inactive caspase-8 mutants , but was absent in shCaspase-8 cells trans-fected with the inactive forms of caspase-8 Supplementary Figure S2b . Of note , less p18 formation was observed in control cells transfected with DM1-GFP , which can not under-go the first cleavage on its own Supplementary Figure S2b . This is because of the fact that , unlike all the other caspase-8 constructs , the p18 formation in cells transfected with this mutant is fully dependent on the cleavage of endogenous caspase-8 . Next , the effect of the different caspase-8 mutants on viability was assessed in shCaspase-8 HeLa cells . Indeed , these cells were protected from Fas-induced apoptosis Figure 1c , gray bars . However , the expression of C8-GFP , DM2-GFP , TM2-GFP or SM1-GFP caused levels of cell death similar to that in shCont HeLa , indicating that these exogenously expressed caspase-8 constructs are fully capable of inducing apoptosis . In contrast , the expression of DM1-GFP or C360S-GFP did not induce cell death without the presence of endogenous caspase-8 Figure 1c . Mitochondrial localization of caspase-8 point mutants . In order to evaluate the link between caspase-8 processing and the subcellular localization , shCont HeLa cells were transfected with the different caspase-8-GFP mutants and assessed by confocal microscopy using the mitochondria-tagged protein Mito-dsRed2 as a marker . Exogenously expressed wt caspase-8 was mostly observed on the mitochondria Figure 2 . Furthermore , we confirmed that the mitochondrial localization of caspase-8 occurred before cytochrome c release and was not blocked by BCL-XL overexpression Supplementary Figure 3 . The disruption of the second cleavage site of caspase-8 still resulted in mitochondrial localization Figure 2 . In addition , non-mitochondrial punctated structures were consistently observed Figure 2 , white arrows . In contrast , when the first cleavage site of caspase-8 was disrupted , the protein lost its mitochondrial localization and was then diffused in the cytosol Figure 2 . This suggested that the formation of the p43-p10 heterodimer may be needed for stable enrichment of caspase-8 on the mitochondria . It is important to mention that even when exogenously expressed caspase-8 was present on the mitochondria , a significant amount of it was still in its unprocessed form Figures 1b and 3a�c . The inactive C360S caspase-8 mutant was also observed on the mitochondria Figure 2 . This is in line with the fact that unlike DM1-GFP , this mutant is capable of being processed into the p43-p10 form by the endogenous caspase-8 through intra-or interdimer cleavage.13 Indeed , C360S-GFP did interact with endogenous caspase-8 on the mitochondria Figure 3a , and can produce high amounts of mitochondria-associated p43 in shCont HeLa Figure 3b . The association of the p43 form of C360S-GFP with the mitochondria was completely absent in shCaspase-8 cells , demonstrating the need for the endogenous caspase-8 for the first cleavage of this mutant Figure 3c . Furthermore , unlike the active mutant TM2-GFP , the two inactive mutants DM1-GFP and C360S-GFP could not generate mitochondria-associated caspase-8-like activity LETDase without endogenous caspase-8 Figure 3d . Overall , these results are in line with the observed dependency of these inactive mutants on endogenous caspase-8 for cell death induction Figure 1c . BID and caspase-8 form a native complex on the mitochondrial membrane . Our data so far has suggested that the mitochondrial localization of active caspase-8 may be needed to specifically target a protein s on the mitochondria to execute apoptosis . As it was previously shown that type II extrinsic apoptosis is dependent on BID cleavage by caspase-8 , we sought to determine if caspase-8 forms a complex with BID on the mitochondria . Mitochondria isolated from shCont HeLa cells , which had been transfected with either BID-mCherry or C360S-mCherry , were solubilized in the mild non-ionic detergent , dodecyl-b-D-maltoside DDM , and the lysates supernatant were run by clear native electrophoresis CNE . Figure 4a clearly showed that both BID-mCherry and C360S-mCherry formed a 4200 kDa complex , which co-migrated to the same position in the first dimension . The BID-mCherry and C360S-mCherry lanes were excised and run in the second dimension by SDS-PAGE to dissociate the complex . Immunoblotting indicated that the majority of mitochondria-associated endogenous BID and BID-mCherry was present within the complex Figure 4b , dashed line . Furthermore , 2D CNE SDS-PAGE revealed that endogenous caspase-8 co-migrated with BID-mCherry , suggesting that it was part of the native complex . Identical results were obtained from the reciprocal experiment using C360S-mCherry mito-chondria , which showed that endogenous BID co-migrated with both C360S-mCherry and endogenous caspase-8 Figure 4c , dashed line . This was the first evidence of caspase-8 and BID forming a native complex on the mitochondrial membrane . Importantly , active caspase-8 p43 was observed within this large complex in caspase-8-transfected cells Figure 4d and Supplementary Figure S4 . The mitochondria-associated BCL-2 family proteins , BCL-XL and BAK , were not part of the caspase-8 BID complex Figure 4b and c . Fas-or TRAIL-activation induced cleavage of BID within a native complex on the mitochondrial membrane . Having identified a native complex of caspase-8 and BID , we wanted to examine the effects that activation of caspase-8 had on the state of the complex . Initially , we found that the endogenous caspase-8 BID complex was also resident on the mitochondrial membranes of untransfected and untreated HeLa cells Figure 5a , solid line . This was supported by 1D SDS-PAGE analysis of isolated mitochondria , which confirmed the presence of BID and caspase-8 on na ? ve � mitochondria Figure 5c , lanes 1�2 . The localization of full length BID on mitochondria of untreated cells would be somewhat surprising , as BID has been reported to be a cytosolic factor that translocates to the mitochondria only after cleavage by caspase-8.17,18 Nevertheless , we consistently detected BID on the mitochondria , and after subcellular fractionation analysis estimated that B20 % of full-length BID protein was associated with the mitochondria of untreated cells data not shown . We also investigated if this complex was present in the non-small-cell lung carcinoma cell line H460 . H460 are type II cells and are sensitive to TRAIL-induced extrinsic apoptosis.23 Similar to HeLa cells , untreated H460 cells contained a native caspase-8 BID complex on the mitochondria Figure 6a . Taken together , these results indicate that both BID full-length and procaspase-8 p55 naturally reside on the mitochondria within a large molecular weight complex . Marked differences in the constitution and migration of the mitochondrial complexes were observed when caspase-8 was activated by TM2-GFP transfection or death receptor ligation Figures 4d , 5b and 6b . The initiation of apoptosis led to an increase in the amount of activated caspase-8 p43 on the mitochondria Figure 6d , compare lanes 3 and 4 . Although p43 was detectable in the DDM-soluble fraction of the mitochondria , it was found to be more highly enriched in the DDM-resistant fraction Figure 5c , compare lanes 3 and 4 . In contrast , BID and procaspase-8 were more equally distributed between the fractions , whereas tBID , BAK , BCL-XL and VDAC1 were more soluble Figures 5c and 6c . Figure 4d clearly showed that in TM2-GFP-transfected cells , p43 was also present in the caspase-8 BID complex . Similar results were obtained in C360S-GFP-transfected HeLa cells Supplementary Figure S4 . In agreement , there was a substantial increase in caspase-8 LETDase activity in the DDM-soluble fractions of Fas-treated shCont HeLa and TRAIL-treated H460 cells compared with untreated cells Figures 5c and 6c , lower panel . In parallel with p43 formation , we found that tBID was also formed within the native complex with caspase-8 Figures 5b and 6b , solid line and shifted to larger molecular weight complexes , which co-migrated with both BAK and BCL-XL dotted lines . These results suggested that after cleavage of BID within the caspase-8 BID complex , tBID is potentially targeted to a separate set of complexes with the BCL-2 family members BAK and or BCL-XL . A plot profile generated from densito-metric analysis of the immunoblots in Figure 5b showed that the majority of the various mitochondria-bound forms of caspase-8 and BID were within a single complex on the mitochondria Figure 5b , lower panel . Recombinant caspase-8 is sufficient to induce cytochrome c release from isolated mitochondria . To further characterize the activity of caspase-8 on mitochondria recombinant , active caspase-8 protein rCaspase-8 was used . Initially , we tested whether active caspase-8 was sufficient to cause the permeabilization of isolated mito-chondria . The level of caspase-8 activity on mitochondrial membranes after incubation with rCaspase-8 was compa-rable with mitochondria isolated from Fas-treated HeLa cells as measured by an LETDase activity assay Supplementary Figure S5 . rCaspase-8 caused a dose-dependent release of cytochrome c from mitochondria isolated from HeLa cells Figure 7a . This was the first indication that incubation of isolated mitochondria with active caspase-8 is sufficient for MOMP . As MOMP is regulated by the BCL-2 family of proteins , 24 we assessed whether the release of cytochrome c induced by rCaspase-8 could be blocked by BCL-XL . Incubation of mitochondria isolated from BCL-XL-expressing HeLa cells with rCaspase-8 showed that cyto-chrome c release was blocked Figure 7b , compare lanes 2 and 5 . These results suggested that caspase-8-induced cytochrome c release from isolated mitochondria was dependent on the BCL-2 family of proteins . BID is necessary for caspase-8-induced cytochrome c release from isolated mitochondria . Figure 7b suggested that caspase-8-induced cytochrome c release is regulated by BCL-2 proapoptotic proteins . BID is known to be a sub-strate of caspase-8 after death receptor activation , 25,26 and we identified a native mitochondrial complex containing caspase-8 and BID Figures 4�6 . Therefore , we examined if caspase-8 could cleave mitochondria-associated BID and if this was sufficient to induce MOMP . Indeed , tBID formation was observed in mitochondria treated with rCaspase-8 Figure 7c , lane 2 . Although mitochondria-associated BID was cleaved by caspase-8 , there may be other targets of caspase-8 on the mitochondrial membrane , which are necessary for MOMP . To test the dependence of caspase-8 on BID to induce MOMP , we transfected HeLa cells with either a non-targeting control siRNA siCont or an siRNA against BID siBID before mitochondria isolation . rCaspase-8 induced the release of the majority of cytochrome c from the mitochondria isolated from siCont cells Figure 7c , lane 2 . In contrast , mitochondria isolated from siBID-transfected cells displayed a significant reduction in the amount of cytochrome c release and tBID formation Figure 7c , lane 4 . These results indicated that BID was required for rCaspase-8-induced cytochrome c release , and that the amount of BID present on the mitochondrial membranes is sufficient to support MOMP . In addition , Figure 7c indicated that caspase-8 association with the mitochondria is not dependent on the availability of BID on the mitochondrial membrane compare lanes 2 and 4 . In addition , we found that TRAIL activation of H460 cells resulted in significant decreases in the levels of mitochondria-bound BID as compared with cytosolic BID , suggesting that the mitochondria may be the main site of caspase-8-induced cleavage of BID Figure 6d . Numerous studies have reported difficulty in detecting active caspase-8 p43-p10 at the DISC in type II cells.15,27 We have now shown that , after Fas or TRAIL activation , p43-p10 is readily detectable on the mitochondrial membrane in multiple cells lines . Given that a native caspase-8 population is already present on the mitochondrial membrane , it is tempting to speculate that caspase-8 can undergo dimerization and self-cleavage activation directly upon the mitochondrial membrane . Alternatively , the presence of non-mitochondrial punctated structures Figure 2 , white arrows could suggest that p43-p10 is formed at the DISC and subsequently translocates to the mitochondria . Mitochondrial targeting of active caspase-8 may be needed for the activation of the native caspase-8 BID complexes on the outer membrane . If this scenario were true , one would expect to see p43-p10 enrichment on the mitochondrial membranes of type I cells . Indeed , we did observe tBID formation within the caspase-8 BID complex in cells , which underwent a �type-I-like� mito-chondrial-independent apoptosis Supplementary Figure S6 . We are currently investigating the mechanism and location of caspase-8 activation in more detail . Nevertheless , the properties and behavior of the inactive mutant of caspase-8 , C360S-GFP , have suggested that it may prove to be a valuable tool for probing how caspase-8 interacts with the mitochondria after death receptor activation . We had previously demonstrated that caspase-8 auto-processing after Fas activation was reliant on an association of caspase-8 with the mitochondrial membrane , and that this association was dependent on the presence of mature cardiolipin.19 In the present study , we have identified a macromolecular complex of caspase-8 and BID on the mitochondrial membrane within which the cleavage of BID tBID formation occurs Figure 8 . Together , our results support the premise that Fas-or TRAIL-induced production of active caspase-8 on the mitochondria is necessary to target mitochondria-associated BID . Importantly , we have shown four key points to support this idea , namely , that caspase-8 was found in a complex with both its substrate BID and product tBID Figures 5b and 6b , a larger proportion of mitochondria-bound BID was cleaved by caspase-8 com-pared with cytosolic BID Figure 6d , incubation of isolated mitochondria with active caspase-8 was sufficient to induce MOMP Figure 7a and the amount of BID on the mitochon-drial membrane was sufficient to support MOMP Figure 7c . Overall , these results might explain why tBID is found exclusively on the mitochondrial membrane and why it , like p43-p10 , has an affinity for cardiolipin . It should be noted that both full-length BID and tBID preferentially bound cardiolipin-containing liposomes in an in vitro assay Supplementary Figure S7 . In addition , we have also found that cells deficient in mature cardiolipin contain less mitochondria-bound BID data not shown . These data suggested , in addition to the previously described model in which cardiolipin provides an activation platform for caspase-8 , that cardiolipin is also necessary for the function and stabilization of the caspase-8 BID complex . A number of independent studies have observed the association of caspase-8 with the mitochondria , but the purpose of its localized production on the mitochondrial outer membrane has remained unknown.19,28�32 Our results suggest that the formation of a death-inducing activation platform on the outer mitochondrial may be needed to effectively target sufficient amounts of BID for the induction of MOMP and to bypass the problem of weak caspase-8 activation at the DISC . Recently , the presence of cardiolipin-enriched microdo-mains in the mitochondrial membrane had been described.33 In those experiments , Triton X-100 was used to solubilize the membranes , a detergent often used in the isolation of lipid rafts.34 Interestingly , we found that the caspase-8 BID complex was not detectable by 2D CNE SDS-PAGE when Triton X-100 was used to solubilize the mitochondria Supplementary Figure S8 . Mitochondria-bound caspase-8 and BID were found solely in the Triton X-100-resistant membrane fraction Supplementary Figure S8 , a result that was consistent with the data presented in Figures 5 and 6 , where higher amounts of active caspase-8 were found in DDM-resistant mitochondrial membranes . Collectively , these data would suggest that the caspase-8 BID complex localizes to mitochondrial membrane microdomains , and that disrup-tion of these microdomains i.e. by depletion of mature cardiolipin inhibits complex formation and caspase-8 activa-tion . However , the presence of mitochondrial lipid rafts is still a matter of debate and characterization of the caspase-8 BID complex and the role of caridolipin in its function requires further clarification.35 In summation , this novel caspase-8 BID mitochondrial complex concentrates the enzyme caspase-8 and its substrate BID on the organelle where it is needed mitochondria , thus providing a means by which the low levels of proteolytically active caspase-8 produced during type II apoptosis are able to efficiently engage the mitochon-drial pathway .

Lower panel The LETDase activity of the DDM-soluble fractions from untreated or TRAIL-treated H460 mitochondria was measured as in Figure 5c . A substantial increase in caspase-8 activity was seen in the DDM-soluble fraction from TRAIL-treated compared with untreated cells . d Subcellular fractionation of H460 cells�TRAIL revealed that p43 is specifically enriched on the mitochondria of H460 cells after TRAIL activation compare lanes 3 and 4 , and that BID on the mitochondria was preferentially processed by caspase-8 in comparison with cytosolic BID Figure 7 Caspase-8 specifically targets BID on the mitochondrial membrane to induce MOMP. a and b Mitochondria isolated from shCont HeLa or BCL-XL HeLa by subcellular fractionation were incubated with different concentrations of recombinant active caspase-8 rC8 . Mitochondria were separated from the supernatant by centrifugation , and both fractions were immunoblotted for cytochrome c release . The Triton X-100 lane represents the total amount of cytochrome c in the purified mitochondria c Mitochondria were isolated from shCont cells transfected with a non-targeting siRNA siCont or an siRNA against BID siBID . Mitochondria were treated as described in a Figure 8 Schematic cartoon depicting a model for type II extrinsic apoptosis . The first step entails the initial activation of apoptosis by Fas or TRAIL , and the formation of the DISC . The next step is the stable insertion of active caspase-8 p43-p10 into the mitochondrial membrane . In the third step , active caspase-8 cleaves BID within the native complex on the mitochondrial membrane , which results in the formation of tBID . Interestingly , after cleavage , tBID gains the ability to dissociate from the caspase-8 BID complex . Cleavage of BID exposes the BH3-domain , and may be the driving force behind tBID dissociation from the caspase-8 BID complex.25 tBID then shifts to separate complexes on the mitochondrial membrane where it interacts with BAK and or BCL-XL to activate MOMP . Apoptogenic factors , such as cytochrome c and Smac DIABLO , are released from the mitochondria , which leads to the activation of effector caspases and cell death 
21072058	A Morizot1,2,9 , D Merino1,2,9 , � N Lalaoui1,2 , G Jacquemin1,2 , V B Chauffert1,2,5 , P Saas6,7,8 , C Garrido1,2 and O Micheau* , 1,2,5 TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand or Apo2L TRAIL is a promising tool for cancer therapy , owing to its ability to eradicate tumor cells while sparing normal cells.1 TRAIL is a type II transmembrane protein , whose binding to its agonistic receptors , namely TRAIL-R1 DR4 and TRAIL-R2 DR5 , TRICK2 or KILLER , triggers apoptosis in a p53-independent manner . Engagement of TRAIL agonistic receptors induces the formation of a molecular platform called the DISC death-inducing signaling complex within minutes , through homotypic interactions.2 This platform includes the adapter protein FADD and caspase-8 , an initiator caspase that is activated and subsequently released from the DISC to the cytosol for dismantling of the cells . The amount of caspase-8 generated within the DISC in type I cells is sufficient to trigger apoptosis through the direct activation of the effector caspase-3 . Type II cells require the engagement of a mitochondrial amplification loop , which is activated by caspase-8-dependent cleavage of Bid , a BH3-only protein that targets the intrinsic pathway through Bax and Bak , allowing the formation of the apoptosome . However , enforced aggregation of TRAIL agonistic receptors in these cells enhances caspase-8 activation at the DISC level and overcomes mitochondrial checkpoints.3 Likewise , enhanced caspase-8 recruitment and activation at the TRAIL DISC by chemotherapeutic drugs has been associated with the restoration of TRAIL sensitivity in hepatocellular and colon carcinomas.4,5 Granci1,2 , E Iessi1,2 , D Lanneau1,2 , F Bouyer1,2 , E Solary1,2,3,4 , Cellular resistance to TRAIL-induced cell death arises from a large variety of events , ranging from defects in DISC formation , or inhibition of more distal events , including mitochondrial block.6,7 TRAIL-induced cell death can be specifically inhibited by two membrane-bound antagonistic receptors , TRAIL-R3 DcR1 , LIT or TRID or TRAIL-R4 DcR2 or TRUNDD .2 These receptors have been shown to be expressed and to prevent TRAIL-induced cell death in various human primary tumor cells , including lymphomas , lung , breast and prostate carcinomas , 8�10 but the inhibitory potential of this receptor still remains controversial.11 Although TRAIL-R3 is a GPI-anchored receptor that sequesters TRAIL into lipid rafts , TRAIL-R4 interacts with TRAIL-R2 within the DISC , and impairs caspase-8 processing , 12 thus , inhibiting TRAIL-induced apoptosis.13,14 The efficacy of recombinant hAPO2L TRAIL in association with chemotherapy is evaluated in ongoing clinical trials.1 It remains unknown whether TRAIL-R4 expression may com-promise the efficacy of TRAIL . We demonstrate here that TRAIL-R4 efficiently inhibits TRAIL , and that chemotherapeutic drugs can overcome this resistance . Restoration of apoptosis primarily occurs at the membrane level , irrespective of the mitochondria , through enhanced caspase-8 recruitment and activation at the TRAIL DISC . TRAIL-R4 expression also impairs TRAIL-induced tumor regression in vivo , but sequential treatments associating CDDP and TRAIL prevent tumor growth in nude mice . Altogether , our results demonstrate that TRAIL-R4 is a negative regulator of TRAIL , whose inhibitory function can be overcome by chemotherapy . Results TRAIL and chemotherapeutic drugs synergistically induce apoptosis in TRAIL-R4-expressing cells . We have demonstrated previously that , ectopic expression of TRAIL-R4 impairs TRAIL-induced cell death through the formation of a heteromeric complex with TRAIL-R2 , leading to the inhibition of caspase-8 activation within the TRAIL DISC.12 Owing to the ability of TRAIL-R4 to inhibit TRAIL-induced cell death , we evaluated whether its expression may compromise combination therapies associating TRAIL with conventional chemotherapeutic drugs . To test this hypothesis , TRAIL-R4 was ectopically expressed using retroviruses in three TRAIL-sensitive tumoral cell lines , HeLa , Jurkat and SW480 . Cell surface expression was assessed by flow cytometry Figure 1a and b . TRAIL-R4 inhibited TRAIL-induced apoptosis in these cells Figure 1c and d . Strikingly , TRAIL-R4 also inhibited death induced by chemotherapeutic drugs in some cell lines . Pre-treatment with pharmacological concentrations of CDDP , VP16 for 3 h or 5FU for 72 h , however , restored TRAIL sensitivity in these cells Figure 1c and d . Similar results were obtained in the B-lymphoma cell line VAL , in which the cells are poorly sensitive to TRAIL-induced cell death Figure 1e . VAL cells endogenously express TRAIL-R4 at the cell surface and high levels of Bcl-2 , because of the t 14 18 chromosomal translocation Figure 1f and g . Cells sensitivity to TRAIL-induced cell death was restored in VAL cells after pre-treatment with CDDP , VP16 , or 5FU Figure 1e . siRNA-mediated downregulation of TRAIL-R4 or Bcl-2 expression in VAL cells also restored sensitivity to TRAIL Figure 1f and g , demonstrating that both TRAIL-R4 and Bcl-2 are functional in these cells . Sequential chemotherapy and TRAIL treatments restore caspase activation . Chemotherapeutic drugs enhanced caspase activation upon TRAIL stimulation Figure 2a without changing TRAIL receptor expression Supple-mentary Figure S1 . In HeLa control cells , TRAIL alone triggered the activation of caspase-8 , caspase-9 and caspase-3 , and induced Bid and PARP cleavage , as demonstrated by the disappearance of their proform or the appearance of cleaved fragments Figure 2a . However , in HeLa cells expressing TRAIL-R4 H-TRAIL-R4 cells , TRAIL induced only a modest cleavage of caspase-8 and caspase-9 , resulting in the poor activation of caspase-3 Figure 2a . Pre-treatment of these cells with CDDP , VP16 , or 5FU restored caspase-3 activation upon TRAIL stimulation , as demonstrated by the appearance of the caspase-3 p17 fragment and an increase in PARP cleavage Figure 2a . Restoration of caspase-3 activation by chemotherapeutic drugs in HeLa-TRAIL-R4 cells was associated with partial activation of both caspase-8 and caspase-9 Figure 2a . Activation of the mitochondrial intrinsic pathway is not required to restore sensitivity to TRAIL in response to chemotherapy . As most chemotherapeutic drugs engage the mitochondrial pathway to trigger apoptosis , we next analyzed its contribution with regard to chemotherapy-mediated sensitization to TRAIL-induced cell death . TRAIL stimulation in control HeLa cells triggered the activation of the intrinsic pathway , as evidenced by the disappearance of Bid Figure 2a , the release of cytochrome c , Smac DIABLO and omi to the cytosol Figure 2b , and by the activation of Bax Figure 2d and e . Release of cytochrome c , Smac DIABLO and omi were much weaker in H-TRAIL-R4 cells as compared with control cells Figure 2c , however , chemotherapy combined with TRAIL nearly completely restored Bax activation in these cells Figure 2d and e . Overexpression of Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL in H-TRAIL-R4 failed to protect cells from TRAIL-induced apoptosis after chemotherapy Figure 3a and b . These results are consistent with the demonstration that chemotherapeutic drugs can restore TRAIL sensitivity in VAL cells , despite large amounts of Bcl-2 expression Figure 1f . To determine the role of Bax in drug-mediated sensitization to TRAIL-induced cell death , we performed the same experiments in the Bax-deficient or parental WT HCT116 cells engineered to express TRAIL-R4 Figure 3c . TRAIL-mediated apoptosis in HCT116 cells was shown to rely on Bax but not Bak activation.15 According to these findings , TRAIL alone , or simultaneous combinations of TRAIL and 5FU , failed to induce apoptosis in Bax-deficient cells Figure 3d and Supplementary Figure S2 . Nevertheless , pre-treatment for 72 h with 5FU before adding TRAIL efficiently induced cell death in these cells Figure 3d . Likewise , treating Bax-deficient cells sequentially for 3 h with CDDP or VP16 , and stimulating with TRAIL , 48 h after the onset of the treatment Counts TRAIL CDDP VP16 5FU CDDP + TRAIL VP16 + TRAIL 5FU + TRAIL 60 Apoptosis Figure 1 Continued . For caption refer previous page in drug-free medium see Materials and Methods restored TRAIL-induced apoptosis Figure 3d . As in HeLa cells , sequential use of chemotherapy and TRAIL afforded sensitization to TRAIL-induced cell death in Bax-proficient cells expressing TRAIL-R4 ectopically Figure 3d . However , Counts 0 TRAIL CDDP VP16 5FU CDDP + VP16 TRAIL + TRAIL 5FU + TRAIL Src # 1 # 2 # 3 TRAIL-R4 40 30 0 Vehicle TRAIL in the absence of Bax , TRAIL-R4 overexpression induced resistance to TRAIL after CDDP or VP16 pretreatment , but not upon 5FU stimulation Figure 3d . Counts Figure 2 Continued . For caption refer next page Sensitization to TRAIL-induced cell death by 5FU has previously been described to involve the deregulation of c-FLIP.4,16 We , therefore , analyzed c-FLIP expression after Active TRAIL CDDP VP16 5FU TRAIL VP16 + TRAIL 5FU + TRAIL chemotherapy at the time when the cells were exposed to TRAIL stimulation . Contrary to our expectations , we found that 5FU poorly induced c-FLIP deregulation in our settings Figure 3e , but that CDDP and VP16 induced c-FLIP upregulation in these cells Figure 3e . Consistent with these findings , expression of c-FLIP abrogated sensitization to TRAIL after 5FU treatment , irrespective of TRAIL-R4 or Bax expression in HCT116 cells Figure 3f , indicating that the mere upregulation of c-FLIP is probably sufficient to impair the synergy irrespective of the mitochondria . In agreement with this finding , the caspase-9 inhibitor z-LEHD-fmk failed to protect TRAIL-R4-expressing cells from TRAIL-induced cell death after chemotherapy , while the pan-caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk completely abrogated the synergy Sup-plementary Figure S3 . Chemotherapeutic drugs enhance caspase-8 recruitment and activation within the TRAIL DISC . To determine the contribution of TRAIL DISC formation and caspase-8 activation in the synergy , c-FLIP was co-expressed in H-TRAIL-R4 cells and cells were stimulated with TRAIL after chemotherapy . Like TRAIL-R4 , expression of c-FLIP Figure 3g reduced cell sensitivity to TRAIL , but alone failed to block apoptosis induced by TRAIL upon chemotherapy Figure 3h . However , combined expression of TRAIL-R4 and c-FLIP severely impaired TRAIL-induced apoptosis by chemotherapeutic drugs , indicating that activation of caspase-8 per se has a prominent role in the synergy Figure 3h . In agreement with these findings , DISC analysis in cells subjected to chemotherapy and TRAIL treatments revealed that chemotherapeutic drugs enhanced caspase-8 recruitment and activation within the TRAIL DISC in HeLa control cells Figure 4a but , probably more importantly , also in HeLa expressing TRAIL-R4 Figure 4b and VAL cells Figure 4c , which express TRAIL-R4 endogenously . Altogether , these results clearly demon-strate that TRAIL-R4 inhibits TRAIL-induced cell death , and that chemotherapy can restore tumor cell sensitivity to apoptosis , mainly through the restoration of caspase-8 recruitment and activation within the DISC . TRAIL-R4 inhibits TRAIL-induced cell death but not chemo-therapy-induced sensitization to TRAIL in vivo . Ability of TRAIL-R4 to prevent TRAIL-induced tumor regression , combined or not with chemotherapy , was next evaluated in nude mice using xenografts of HCT116 cells expressing TRAIL-R4 . Mice were implanted , in both flanks , with HCT116-Ctl cells right flank and HCT116-TRAIL-R4 left flank . When the tumor volume reached 20 mm3 , mice were treated with phosphate-buffered saline PBS , CDDP , recombinant TRAIL or treated sequentially with CDDP and TRAIL as described in the Materials and Methods section . Compared with PBS-treated mice , HCT116-Ctl tumor growth was inhibited in mice receiving injections of TRAIL , CDDP and by the combined treatment Figure 5a . However , TRAIL , and to a lesser extent CDDP , failed to induce tumor regression in TRAIL-R4-expressing cells Figure 5b , but combined treatments induced a marked inhibition of the tumor growth of HCT116 cells expressing TRAIL-R4 Figure 5b , with statistically significant P-values o0.001 as compared with PBS-treated mice . These results demonstrate that TRAIL-R4 efficiently inhibits TRAIL-induced cell death not only in vitro , but also in vivo . However , chemotherapeutic drugs , including CDDP , can overcome TRAIL-R4 mediated resistance , highlighting the potential therapeutic value of these combined therapies for cancer . Discussion TRAIL-based combinatorial therapies are emerging paradigms for cancer treatment as synergistic activation of TRAIL-induced apoptosis by chemotherapeutic drugs gen-erally affords to overcome tumor cell resistance , whereas monotherapies are most of the time poorly successful . Pre-clinical studies and clinical trials are giving promising results , supporting the potential of these combining approaches.17,18 Cell surface expression of TRAIL agonistic receptors is the first requirement in order to trigger the TRAIL apoptotic machinery but , to date , the expression of TRAIL receptors in primary tumors remains poorly studied and the anti-apoptotic function of TRAIL-R4 remains controversial . It was found , however , in a few studies that primary lymphomas could express functional TRAIL antagonistic receptors at the cell surface.10 In solid tumors , analysis of TRAIL receptor expression was often performed by immunohistochemistry , and although this method does not provide the information whether the receptors are expressed at the cell surface , these studies indicate that the extent of expression of the antagonistic receptors TRAIL-R3 and TRAIL-R4 is probably underestimated.9,19�21 Engagement of apoptosis upon TRAIL stimulation in a given tissue type , primary tumor or cell line , relies on the contribution of multiple players , including proapoptotic and prosurvival factors , which ultimately determine cell fate . It has TRAILCDDP VP16 5FU CDDP + VP16 TRAIL+ 5FU TRAIL+ TRAIL Counts 100 80 TRAILCDDP VP16 5FU CDDP + VP16 TRAIL+ 5FU + TRAIL 100 80 TRAIL CDDP VP16 5FU CDDP + VP16 TRAIL + TRAIL 5FU + TRAIL 0 Ctl-EGFP TRAIL-R4-EGFP Ctl-FLIPTRAIL-R4-FLIP Figure 3 Continued . For caption refer next page 0 recently been demonstrated that naturally occurring differ-ences in the levels or states of proteins regulating TRAIL signaling are the primary causes of cell-to-cell variability.22 The large variety of cellular changes in protein levels or status induced by chemotherapeutic drugs may explain why these drugs , restore TRAIL sensitivity in resistant cells , albeit targeting different signaling pathways . Sensitization to TRAIL by chemotherapeutic drugs , has been attributed to multiple molecular mechanisms including the upregulation of TRAIL-R2,23 activation of the mitochondrial pathway24,25 inhibition of c-FLIP expression26 or enhanced caspase-8 recruitment to the TRAIL DISC.4,5 We demonstrate here that chemotherapy overcomes TRAIL resistance induced by TRAIL-R4 at the level of the DISC , and provide strong evidence that the mitochondrial pathway is dispensable for the restoration of TRAIL sensitivity by chemotherapeutic drugs Figure 6 . Chemotherapeutic drugs afforded sensitization to TRAIL of aggressive B-cell follicular lymphomas such as VAL cells , despite endogenous expression of functional TRAIL-R4 and Bcl-2 . Likewise , these compounds restored TRAIL sensitivity of epithelial-derived tumor cell lines harboring either a deficiency for Bax expression , or engineered to express Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL , irrespective of TRAIL-R4 expression levels . Bax deficiency however , may be detrimental to some chemotherapeutic drugs in cells that express TRAIL-R4 and low but significant levels of c-FLIP . Accordingly , restoration of TRAIL sensitivity in HCT116 Bax-deficient cells expressing TRAIL-R4 was only observed with 5FU , but not CDDP or VP16 because of their ability to induce c-FLIP expression . These results could explain some discrepancies regarding the lack of correlation regarding TRAIL-R4 expression and cell sensitivity to TRAIL-induced cell death . In particular , c-FLIP expression levels have scarcely been taken into consideration in these studies . Our results demonstrate that TRAIL-R4 can inhibit TRAIL-induced cell death both in vitro and in vivo , and cooperate with c-FLIP to inhibit chemotherapy-mediated sensitization to TRAIL-induced apoptosis Figure 6 . These findings not only have important implications for the understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in the regulation of TRAIL signaling , but also for therapeutic approaches aiming at utilizing recombinant TRAIL to cure patients suffering from cancer . The physiological function and relevance of TRAIL-R4 is still unclear . Our study is probably the first demonstration that TRAIL-R4 can confer TRAIL resistance in vivo , as we demonstrate that ectopic expression of this receptor in the colon carcinoma cell line HCT116 efficiently impairs TRAIL-induced tumor killing in nude mice . At the physiological level , TRAIL-R4 could protect cells selectively from TRAIL-induced cell death . Noteworthy , it has been demonstrated that NK and CD8 ? T cells are induced to express TRAIL , TRAIL-R2 , TRAIL-R4 and c-FLIP upon activation.27 Despite high expression levels of TRAIL , these cells are resistant to TRAIL , but selective inhibition of c-FLIP expression induced TRAIL sensitivity.27 It should be noted , however , that selective TRAIL-R4 downregulation was not assessed in this study , therefore , it is conceivable that TRAIL-R4 may also have a role in protecting these cells from TRAIL-induced cell death . Although the function of TRAIL-R4 remains to be determined in a physiological context , our results indicate that this receptor in pathological conditions , such as overexpres-sion in primary tumor cells , could represent a problem in oncology . Our results clearly support the inhibitory potential of TRAIL-R4 and , in agreement with previous studies , 4,5 sustain the demonstration that chemotherapy sensitize tumor cells to TRAIL mainly through the regulation of caspase-8 activation at the DISC level . The molecular mechanisms leading to the restoration of caspase-8 recruitment and enhancement of caspase-8 activation within the TRAIL DISC after chemotherapy remains an open question . Some reports indicate that chemo-therapeutic drugs could enhance TRAIL receptor clustering at the cell surface , through ceramide production and receptor partitioning into lipid rafts.28,29 Work is currently in progress to address this question in our laboratory . Remarkably , like c-FLIP , 30,31 ectopic expression of TRAIL-R4 induced cross-resistance to some chemotherapeutic drugs in vitro and in vivo . How TRAIL-R4 impairs chemo-therapy-induced apoptosis remains to be determined . Some reports point to the observation that forced aggregation of some death receptors of the TNF family including Fas , or downstream effectors like Bid , may contribute to genotoxic drug-induced apoptosis in a ligand-independent manner.31�33 Combined expression of TRAIL-R4 and c-FLIP may , there-fore , not only impair TRAIL-induced cell death after chemo-therapy , but may also alter chemotherapy itself . In line with this hypothesis , it has been demonstrated that c-FLIP and TRAIL-R4 are overexpressed in a growing number of primary tumors and that their expression levels has recently been defined as a poor prognostic marker in colorectal34 and prostate cancer patients.35 Altogether our results clearly demonstrate that TRAIL-R4 is a negative regulator of TRAIL whose inhibitory function can be overcome using chemotherapy to restore TRAIL-induced cell death . However , we also demonstrate that TRAIL-R4 cooperates with c-FLIP to inhibit TRAIL-induced apoptosis after chemotherapy . Their ability to cooperate and to efficiently inhibit TRAIL-induced apoptosis needs to be taken into consideration both in vitro and in future clinical trials to assess the efficacy of combinatorial treatments associating recombinant TRAIL with chemotherapy . It is anticipated that patients expressing both TRAIL-R4 and c-FLIP may respond better to alternative therapeutic approaches , including non-conventional chemotherapeutic drugs , TRAIL deriva-tives , targeting specifically TRAIL-R2 , or to strategies aiming at inhibiting c-FLIP expression or blocking TRAIL-R4 .

In vivo evaluation of the combination of CDDP and TRAIL . 5-week - old athymic female mice NMRI nu nu were obtained from Janvier Le Genest Saint-Isle , France .

Mice were subcutaneously xenografted with 4 106 HCT116-Ctl cells in the right flank and 4 106 HCT116-TRAIL-R4 in the left flank . Mice were weighed and tumor volume was evaluated every 2 days by caliper measurement using the following formula l l L 2 , with l the lower and L the higher dimension . When the tumor volume reached 20 mm3 , mice were divided randomly into four groups with four mice per group day 0 . The first group served as a control and received 0.2 ml PBS as vehicle at days 0 and 8 , and 0.1 ml PBS containing 10 mM b-mercaptoethanol at days 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 and 10 , 11 , 12 , 13 .

Johnson Keywords Ecology 1 . Background A major focus of ageing research is to identify genes and or pathways that regulate the rate of ageing in model organisms . It is thought that such research will provide an essential contribution to a healthier long life in our own species Partridge and Gems , 2006 , because the genes offer the possibility of translation to humans through the evolutionary conservation of the involved regulatory pathways . Mutational mapping and the discovery of single gene mutants with a long-lived phenotype in laboratory stocks of species such as the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans Friedman and Johnson , 1988 Kenyon et al. , 1993 Lakowski and Hekimi , 1996 , the fruitfly Drosophila melanogasiter Clancy et al. , 2001 Lin et al. , 1998 Rogina et al. , 2000 and the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae Kennedy et al. , 1995 have greatly expanded our knowledge of the regulation of processes that contribute to ageing . Another approach to candidate ageing gene discovery is to combine quantitative trait loci mapping and complementation tests to find small genomic regions that contribute to variation in relevant phenotypes Flatt , 2004 Geiger-Thornsberry and Mackay , 2004 Harbison et al. , 2004 Leips et al. , 2006 . Both approaches include the use of long term laboratory strains of D. melanogaster , including inbred lines . However , to achieve the aim of application of the identified candidate ageing genes in healthy human ageing , we need to know whether these genes are contrib-uting to the variation in human lifespan . There is an urgent need for an integrated approach that involves mutant identification , establish-ment of evolutionary conservation between species of the genes , and , finally , the confirmation that such conserved genes show allelic variation in natural populations . Although such studies are scarce Duvernell et al. , 2003 Schmidt et al. , 2000 they convey important information about the function of candidate ageing genes in natural populations . 1.1 . A candidate gene approach into variation in ageing in Bicyclus anynana Here , we report on the gene expression of candidate ageing genes in laboratory populations of B. anynana , a butterfly with well understood ecology . We included two populations artificially selected for adult starvation resistance , and compared these to the unselected Stock population from which they were derived control line . As a result of artificial selection , the adult lifespan of these butterflies is not only considerably increased under starvation , but also under optimal food conditions . In the selected butterflies , distributions of other important life-history and physiological traits were shifted to a phenotype with increased survival and nutritional storage , �mainte-nance� , at the expense of reproduction Pijpe et al. , 2008 . In addition , unpublished data indicate a reduction in mating success for selected males in competition with unselected males under optimal conditions Pijpe , 2007 , PhD Thesis . These combined results led us to suggest that the selected butterflies physiology would be highly adaptive in the dry season Pijpe et al. , 2008 . The dry season form displays the suite of traits , including extended lifespan , needed to survive the dry season until the next possibility of reproduction arrives in the following wet season Brakefield and Reitsma , 1991 . In this study , we specifically address the positive genetic correlation between adult starvation resistance and adult lifespan in these lines by investigating the variation in candidate gene expres-sion . Gene expression is the important first step in the complex process from the genotype to the phenotype . We used quantitative real-time PCR qPCR to measure candidate gene expression in adult males sampled at various conditions and at various ages . On the basis of availability in the B. anynana EST database Beldade et al. , 2006 , we chose three genes that have been shown to be important in other organisms in both starvation resistance and ageing Indy e.g . Marden et al. , 2003 Rogina et al. , 2000 , sod2 e.g . Tyler et al. , 1993 and catalase e.g . Arking et al. , 2000a Mockett et al. , 2001 . Importantly , our set-up allows us to distinguish between environmental factors and genetic factors influencing gene expression , and allows us to study their interactions . A summary of our expectations can be seen in Table 1 . 1.2 . Indy Indy I m not dead yet codes for a sodium dicarboxylate co-transporter . These membrane proteins are responsible for the uptake or re-uptake of Krebs cycle intermediates Knauf et al. , 2002 . In D. melanogaster , hypomorphic mutant flies with reduced expression live up to 80 % longer under laboratory conditions Rogina et al. , 2000 . The researchers suggested that mutations in the Indy gene may reduce the availability of these key metabolic intermediates to the cell , thus reducingthe generationof metabolicenergy.Becausethis resembles the Table 1 Schematic overview of the expected outcomes for this experiment . Effect Comparison Indy sod2 catalase The expression for given comparison ratio is ? lower , + higher , ? + effect will depend on mechanism see text for explanation . lifespan-increasing effect of caloric restriction that has been documen-ted in various species , it is thought that Indy may provide a genetic mechanism for caloric restriction Rogina et al. , 2000 . In adult D. melanogaster , Indy is expressed in the fat body , midgut and oenocytes Knauf et al. , 2002 . These organs are thought to be the primary sites of intermediary metabolism , absorption and metabolic storage in adult insects . Indy appears to be involved in the regulation of reproduction and metabolism Marden et al. , 2003 which resembles the selected butterfly starvation resistance phenotype see above . Thus , in B. anynana , we hypothesise a reduced Indy expression in the lines selected for increased starvation resistance compared to the unselected Stock . However , under starvation we expect an up-regulation of Indy that diminishes gene expression differences between lines , because nutrients mobilised from reserves need to be available for survival . Age effects are difficult to predict the expected reduction in metabolic efficiency with age could give a lower causal or higher compensatory expression . 1.3 . sod2 and catalase catalase and sod2 manganese superoxide dismutase 2 are central to oxidative stress resistance their products neutralise reactive oxygen species ROS , and form a main line of anti-oxidative defense enzymes in eukaryotes . The mitochondrial respiratory chain that reduces oxygen to water is the metabolic engine of high-energy aerobic metabolism . ROS such as superoxide radicals are a by-product of oxidative phosphorylation in all aerobic organisms , and are thought to be a major cause of intra cellular damage that increases the rate of ageing Beckman and Ames , 1998 . There is a large body of literature that suggests that genetically increased stress resistance and lifespan are accompanied by up-regulation of anti-oxidant enzymes Hekimi and Guarente , 2003 Landis et al. , 2004 . The superoxide dismutases SODs are a family of antioxidant enzymes present in most eukaryotic cells SOD2 is located in the mitochondrial matrix to detoxify superoxide radicals released during respiration and convert these to hydrogen peroxide Landis and Tower , 2005 . Loss of sod2 activity in D. melanogaster causes a net increase in superoxide radical load in mitochondria resulting in mitochondrial membrane damage , which in turn leads to lethal cell death in heart , brain and muscle Duttaroy et al. , 2003 . Transgenic studies that over-express sod genes typically find a higher stress resistance and often a higher lifespan in D. melanogaster and Saccharomyces cerviseae reviewed in Landis and Tower , 2005 , but this depends critically on the method used Orr and Sohal , 2003 , and on genetic background and sex Spencer et al. , 2003 . Thehydrogenperoxideformedinthereductionofsuperoxideanions by SOD2 is further reduced by Catalase to water and oxygen . In D. melanogaster , artificial over-expression does not seem to influence lifespan , and it was suggested that Catalase is typically present in excess Landis et al. , 2004 . However , the expression of catalase in adult D. melanogaster is restricted to intermediary metabolic , digestive and adipose tissues , and oenocytes , highly comparabletothelocation of Indy expression Klichko et al. , 2004 . Therefore , catalase remains an interesting candidate gene for survival under metabolic stress . Research on the expression of anti-oxidant genes in long-lived artificial selection lines of D. melanogaster has given important indications but do not always give consistent results catalase expression can be higher Foley and Luckinbill , 2001 , but also lower Mockett et al. , 2001 . Another study showed that increased lifespan is correlated with higher sod2 expression in one replicate line , and with higher catalase expression in another Arking et al. , 2000a both findings are confirming the role of oxidative stress resistance in lifespan determination . For our selected lines , we expect higher expression of sod2 and catalase in the selection lines , independent of the treatment . In addition , we expect higher expression with increasing stress . 2 . Materials and methods 2.1 . Butterflies life history and artificial selection Both long adult lifespans and the necessity of high starvation resistance occur naturally in the life history of the butterfly B. anynana Butler , 1879 , an emerging model species for the study of lifespan and ageing in an ecological perspective Brakefield et al. , 2007 Pijpe et al. , 2006 . B. anynana is a tropical , multi-voltine , fruit-feeding species that lives in a highly seasonal environment in East Africa Brakefield and Reitsma , 1991 . The evolution of phenotypic plasticity in this species has led to two distinct seasonal forms . Butterflies of the dry season form are long-lived they must survive the dry season 5� 7 months to be able to reproduce at the start of the next wet season . In contrast , individuals of the two generations of the wet season form show rapid reproduction and short lifespan Brakefield and Frankino , 2007 . In both seasons , but especially in much of the dry season , the availability of fruit in tropical forest typically varies in space and time . Therefore , mild starvation occurs regularly in the life of this butterfly and starvation resistance may be especially important in the dry season form Pijpe et al. , 2006 . The laboratory stock of B. anynana was established in 1988 from around 80 gravid females caught at a single location in Malawi . This stock is kept in outbred conditions Van t Hof et al. , 2005 in climate controlled chambers . Analysis of the mitochondrial CO1 gene has revealed limited haplotypic change between the laboratory stock and wild populations sampled from the same area in 2008 de Jong , 2010 , PhD Thesis . Inadvertent lab adaptation did not preclude a successful series of artificial selection experiments that targeted a range of life history , physiological and morphological traits Brakefield et al. , 2009 . The larvae are fed on young maize plants and adults on moist banana for both stock and experimental rearing , unless indicated otherwise . To investigate the genetics , physiology and adaptive role of starvation resistance in B. anynana , two artificially selected lines SR1 and SR2 were started from the stock . These lines showed increased median lifespan under starvation stress 60 % and under optimal food conditions 40 % , as well as shifted distributions for other important life-history and physiological traits Pijpe et al. , 2008 . 2.2 . Experimental procedures rearing and housing For our experiment we used adult males of three lines an unselected Stock line , and the two selected lines , SR1 and SR2 . Animals were kept in a climate controlled chamber at 27 �C , 70 % relative humidity and 12 12 light to dark regime . Larvae were reared on ad libitum young maize in dedicated mesh cages , and a minimum of 100 pupae were collected . At eclosion , butterflies were separated by sex . Virgin male butterflies were collected in a cylindrical hanging cage 25 ? ? 60 cm on each day of eclosion , with a maximum of 15 per cage to minimise density stress . We introduced two food treatments . Butterflies in the optimal food treatment were supplied with banana slices on water saturated cotton wool , whereas those in the starvation treatment were supplied with water saturated cotton wool only to prevent desiccation stress . Both were refreshed three times a week and cages from both treatments were kept next to each other in order to minimise the influence of environmental variation . Due to practical limitations we focused on the male sex only to increase exploratory power . Survival was measured by scoring individual deaths daily . The butterflies not sampled for RNA extraction were followed to measure survival under starvation . We gave priority to an adequate measurement of survival under starvation and therefore had to divide the butterflies over the treatment groups in such a way that numbers of butterflies were insufficient to properly assess survival in the ad libitum food treatment . However , we have shown previously that lifespan under such conditions is at least 40 % higher in the selection lines compared to the unselected Stock Pijpe et al. , 2008 . Moreover , Stock lifespan is consistent and predictable between experiments in similar environ-mental conditions data not shown . 2.3 . Experimental procedures time point selection To adequately investigate the effects of starvation stress and ageing on gene expression , we chose 3 time-points per treatment at which butterflies from three lines were randomly sampled , labelled as follows see Fig. 1 . � �Day 0� on the first day of adult life , within 10 h of eclosion . This point is used as a base line , and is a single sampling time point for both treatments . � �Early� at the age of 2 days under starvation or at 14 days under optimal conditions , there is low mortality and little difference between the lines . Potential physiological differences between lines should become apparent in the expression of the genes . � �Late� at the age of 4 for the Stock line or 5 for both SR lines days under starvation , and 35 days under optimal food conditions , there is a clear contrast in survival between lines . Under starvation , the Stock mortality was in the exponential phase of increase at the age of 4 days , but this had not begun yet for the SR lines . To be able to properly compare the physiological stages in starvation resistance and their effect on gene expression between the selected lines and the Stock , we chose the age of 5 days for the selection lines . We chose tentative time points for sampling based on an average survival of previous results under similar conditions . We monitored survival during the experiment and made minor changes to the final sampling scheme Fig. 1 . We were careful not to choose time points that are beyond 50 % mortality in the population , as this increases the likelihood of sampling highly morbid individuals that are close to their time of death . We sampled five male butterflies per time point , treatment and line , thus obtaining a total of 75 samples . The chosen live butterflies were frozen instantly in N2 l , put in micro tubes after removal of the wings and stored at ? 80 �C until subsequent RNA isolation . We always sampled at the same hour �30 min during the light phase of the circadian cycle of the butterflies . 2.4 . Molecular genetics 2.4.1 . Gene sequence information All sequence information was obtained from the B. anynana EST database Beldade et al. , 2006 . The sequenced contigs were BLASTed against relevant gene collections for annotation . Additional Gene Ontology information Ashburner et al. , 2000 was obtained by direct or indirect BLAST to D. melanogaster gene collections . GenBank accession numbers and primer names and sequences are given in Table 3 . GenBank EST sequence information does not include annotation information at this point . 2.4.2 . RNA isolation and cDNA synthesis Total RNA from individual abdomens was extracted using the Nucleospin� RNA II kit and additional DNase treatment Machery-Nagel according to the kit protocol . The initial and final steps deviated from these protocols as follows before and again after disruption of the abdomen , 175 ? l of a mixture of RA1 buffer Nucleospin� and ? -mercaptoethanol was added to the micro tube RNA was eluted in 50 ? l RNase free water and stored at ? 20 �C until cDNA synthesis . RNA concentration and purity were measured using a ND1000 spectropho-tometer NanoDrop Technologies . Samples of low quantity b100 ng ? l and or quality A260 A280 ratio outside the range of 1.9 to 2.1 were not used . cDNA was synthesised in 20.0 ? l reactions using 1.00 ? g total extracted mRNA in the First Transcription System Promega . 2.4.3 . Real time qPCR To measure the gene expression we used quantitative real-time PCR qPCR with the cDNA as a template . The amount of amplified product during the qPCR reaction was detected using SYBRGreen� Eurogentec , a fluorescent a-specific DNA binding dye . Per gene , a fluorescence threshold was set , at which the number of reaction cycles Ct was scored . qPCR reactions were performed on a MJ Research PTC 200 thermal cycler with a mounted Chromo4 Real-Time Detector BioRad . Control and data acquisition was done with the accompanying Opticon Monitor 3.1 software BioRad . We checked the raw Ct data for outliers using one-way-ANOVA , and values that deviated more than 2 standard deviation from the mean per line and treatment were excluded from further analysis . In total , 10 samples were excluded because of this approach . These were evenly distributed among the lines and treatments . In one sample , we discarded the data for Indy , but not for sod2 and catalase . The RT control samples sample reactions that were not reverse transcribed and thus did not contain cDNA indicated that not all DNA was removed during RNA isolation . A major advantage of real time qPCR is that this contamination can be controlled for in all cases the RT control Ct values were N10 Ct higher then cDNA sample Ct values , indicating that the very low 210 fold lower fluorescent signals from DNA contamination do not influence the cDNA amplification and hence quantification until well after the threshold cycle . 2.4.4 . Primer sequences Primer design was done using Primer3 software Rozen and Skaletsky , 2000 . Adjustments to the default conditions were as follows product size range 100�150 base pairs , Tm 60.0 �C minimum , GC content at 50 % maximum , and maximum Tm difference for primers 1.0 �C . All primer pairs were tested for specificity and dimer formation by visual inspection of ethidium bromide stained agarose gels after regular PCR . The primer sequences are shown in Table 3 . 2.4.5 . Calculation of relative expression The calculation of relative expression is performed with GeneX software Bio-Rad . It essentially uses the method of Pfaffl 2001 . In short , the raw Ct data are normalised to a single randomly chosen sample , and consecutively normalised to the geometric mean of the Table 2 Results of the gene-expression analysis with general linear models . Gene Model N Effect df Sum of squares p ? ? p b0.001 . ? ? ? pb 0.0005 . expression of three reference genes . GeneX allows correcting for PCR efficiency E by giving more weight to the relative expression values with higher E before averaging . E is calculated from the slope of a standard curve using the following formula E ? % ? 10 ? ? 1 slope ? ? 1 T100 Table 3 GenBank accession numbers and primer sequence information for the genes used in this study . The standard curve was determined per gene from 5 reactions from a dilution series , using cDNA from a pool of all samples as a template . 2.4.6 . Reference genes Reference genes must possess two main properties . First , they should be ubiquitously expressed in all tissues , for example because they are essential for the maintenance of cellular function and viability �housekeeping gene� . Secondly , their transcription should be mini-mally affected by the experimental context , which in our case includes a wide range of environments . We initially chose 6 genes based on their supposed roleas �housekeepinggene� . We thentestedwhether they met the second condition by using geNorm Vandesompele et al. , 2002 , which allows ranking of the variation in expression of genes based on a calculated stability measure . Ct values were scaled relative to the lowest Ct value highest absolute expression among the samples . The three most stable expressed genes that were used as reference genes were EF- ? Elongation factor 1 alpha , FK506 FK506 binding protein 2 and VhaSDF Vacuolar ATP synthase subunit H . The genes ? tubuline [ GenBank DY767109 ] , ? tubuline [ GenBank DY772209 ] , and develop-mental embryonic B [ GenBank DY766034 ] exhibited a too wide a range across all samples analysis not shown . 2.5 . Statistical analysis Relative expression values were log-transformed to satisfy the requirement of equal variances before analysis of variance ANOVA . Two separate analyses were performed . First , an overall model was built with factors line and treatment , and their interaction . The treatment factor differentiates stress and optimal food conditions , with all time points included in both treatments . Secondly , models by treatment were built , with time 0 , 2 and 4 5 days for starvation , and 0 , 14 and 35 days for optimal , line and their interaction to investigate stress intensity and age effects , respectively . Significant differences between factors were qualified by post-hoc Tukey HSD tests ? 0.05 , or with a Student s t-test when appropriate . All three lines Stock , SR1 , and SR2 were treated as independent lines . The effect of line on survival under starvation was analysed with a Cox Proportional Hazard model . Lines were compared pair-wise to quantify survival differences with risk ratios . All analyses were performed using JMP 5.0.1.2 SAS Institute . 3 . Results 3.1 . Survival Males of both selection lines show a doubling of survival under starvation compared to the unselected Stock Fig. 2 Pijpe et al. , 2008 . The cohorts of SR males show a later onset of the exponential mortality phase , suggesting that SR selection males suffer less from starvation stress . In addition , we have previously shown that males of both selection lines are long-lived their mean lifespan has increased by 60 % Pijpe et al. , 2008 . The aim of this study is to investigate whether these genetic differences in survival can be traced back at least in part to differences in candidate gene expression . 3.2 . Gene expression 3.2.1 . Indy There is no evident line effect in the overall analysis that includes line and treatment Table 2 . The treatment has a highly significant effect , with a higher expression under stress conditions Fig. 3A , Table 2 . Two patterns are observed in an analysis by treatment . First , Indy expression is down-regulated at later ages under optimal food conditions Table 2 Tukey Eclosion EarlyNLate , suggesting that Indy expression is associated with age . Secondly , Indy is up-regulated upon prolonged starvation , compared to mild starvation Table 2 Tukey Eclosion EarlybLate . There are no significant differences between lines . The relatively high variation in Indy expression large standard errors makes it difficult to find such potentially subtle expression differences . 3.2.2 . sod2 The overall analysis of sod2 Table 2 reveals no significant differences in expression between lines nor between treatments . This seems in part due to the remarkably high expression at eclosion day 0 and at mild stress 2 days of starvation Fig. 3B . It is difficult to explain this observation . The period around eclosion is a particularly physio-logically dynamic time , characterised by a multitude of processes , including a high metabolism and a high oxidative stress Hilliker et al. , 1992 White et al. , 1999 , which might require high sod2 expression . Note that the standard errors at eclosion are not different from the other time points , indicating a similar level of control of gene expression across ages . This suggests that the high level of gene expression of sod2 at eclosion is biologically relevant rather than an artefact . In the stress treatment , line and especially age are highly significant factors affecting expression Table 2 . Post hoc analysis of the line effect shows that both selected lines have a significantly higher expression than the Stock line over all ages SR2 has a significantly higher expression than SR1 Tukey StockbSR1bSR2 . In all lines , sod2 expression is much lower under prolonged stress compared to mild stress . At this point , there are no significant differences between lines . There is also a significant age-by-line interaction . The decline in gene expression starts at mild stress in the Stock , and to some extent also in SR1 , but starts for SR2 only at prolonged stress Fig. 3B . In the optimal treatment Table 2 there is a significant age effect caused by the results for day 0 . At this time point , sod2 expression is significantly higher than at 14 and 35 days , which do not significantly differ from each other Tukey EclosionNEarly Late . Lines differ significantly in expression when all ages are taken together Table 2 . Both SR lines have a higher expression than Stock Tukey SR1 SR2NStock . Excluding day 0 with exceptionally high expres-sion renders the line effect non-significant F2 , 18 3.14 , p 0.068 . However , a less conservative Student s t post hoc test shows that expression of both selection lines is significantly different from Stock Student s t SR1 SR2NStock , indicating that the trend towards higher expression in selection line males is evident in all cases . 3.2.3 . catalase The analysis over all treatments shows a significant effect of treatment and of line on the expression of catalase Table 2 . This gene is significantly up-regulated under stress compared to optimal conditions Fig. 3C . Over all treatments , SR2 has a significantly higher expression compared to both SR1 and Stock Tukey Stock SR1bSR2 . The analysis of the optimal treatment shows no effect of line . Age has a significant effect on gene-expression Table 2 . Thus , at day 14 , expression is significantly higher than at days 0 and 35 , which have a similar expression Tukey Eclosion LatebEarly . Analysis within the stress treatment shows that both line and age significantly affect expression Table 2 . Expression under mild or prolonged stress is significantly higher compared to day 0 , and also compared to optimal conditions Fig. 3C . A post hoc analysis of the age effect shows that SR2 has a higher expression than SR1 and Stock Tukey Stock SR1bSR2 . Thus , catalase expression seems to be related to the selection in SR2 , but not in SR1 . 4 . Discussion The goal of our study is to investigate whether variation in candidate ageing gene expression is associated with starvation resistance and longevity in B. anynana . The key to our approach is using artificial selection lines that probe the standing genetic variation for these traits in the context of knowledge about their roles in the life history and ecology of the species in natural and seasonal environ-ments . In addition , our approach is critically dependent on the inclusion of multiple ages and multiple environments , including the selected environment . Previously , we have observed the changes in life history and physiological traits that are the consequence of artificial selection . We concluded that , in B. anynana males , it is a more efficient use of resources through a reduction of metabolic rate rather than increasing resources in the form of fat storage that enables the selected butterflies to survive longer under starvation stress and under optimal food conditions Pijpe et al. , 2008 . Thus , for the selected lines we speculated that increased ROS scavenging and a more efficient metabolism could contribute to this survival strategy that would be highly adaptive in the dry season Brakefield et al. , 2007 . The genes studied in this experiment are involved in these processes . The significance of the link between such physiological adaptations and stress resistance and longevity is debated in genetic studies that use D. melanogaster see Baldal et al. , 2006 and references therein . However , in the light of our knowledge of the species ecology Brakefield and Frankino , 2007 Brakefield and Reitsma , 1991 , such a correlation in B. anynanaI is expected to be substantial . The correlative nature of this study precludes causal inference of gene function , but the strength of artificial selection lines is that these findings can point to important conclusions about genetic mechanisms of ageing in this species . The selection lines are expected to represent populations enriched in alleles that contribute to increased survival in relevant , adverse environments encountered in nature . Therefore , we predicted Table 1 that the gene expression of Indy , sod2 , and catalase would have changed accordingly in the selected lines compared to the unselected control . We discuss the results for each candidate gene separately below . 4.1 . Indy We expected Indy to have evolved changed gene expression in the selection lines , given it is an important gene in intermediary metabolic pathways Knauf et al. , 2002 . However , our results show that Indy expression is not involved in the response to selection for starvation resistance , nor in the correlated response of increased longevity . This corroborates the recent finding that the previously reported longevity effect of the Drosophila Indy mutant is confounded by the genetic and cytoplasmic background Toivonen et al. , 2007 . However , our findings do indicate a role of Indy in stress biology . We suggest that Indy is involved in the environmentally induced response to starvation . Up-regulating Indy increases the transport of metabo-lites Knauf et al. , 2002 , which probably results from butterflies accessing energy reserves to provide the necessary energy in absence of nutrition . Expression levels under mild starvation are similar to those on day 0 or day 14 , indicating that mild starvation is apparently not a sufficient stimulus to trigger the access to energy reserves . This suggests that a starvation period of two days lies within the normal physiological range of the population . Our results are in disagreement with a recent finding in Drosophila that caloric restriction down-regulates Indy expression Wang et al. , 2009 , which may reflect the relative importance of starvation stress in natural populations of these species that is related to the difference between a reduction and the complete absence of caloric intake . We show that Indy expression is lowered at higher ages . This may be explained by an ageing effect a reduced demand for citric acid cycle intermediates with age . How Indy regulates ageing is a matter of continuous debate Toivonen et al. , 2009 . Recent findings in Drosophila point to an increased mitochondrial metabolic efficiency Neretti et al. , 2009 . Our results suggest that stress resistance mechanisms could be involved . 4.2 . sod2 We expected that SR line butterflies have an intrinsically higher sod2 expression that may be fundamental to their ability to better resist starvation and to live longer under normal food conditions . This would be in line with some previous findings Arking et al. , 2000a , b Dudas and Arking , 1995 Mockett et al. , 2001 . Indeed , we find that sod2 is constitutively up-regulated in selection lines , independent of environmental conditions . Therefore , variation in the expression of sod2 is closely associated with the selection response . Notably , this suggests that sod2 contributes directly to the genetic correlation between starvation resistance and longevity observed in our selection experiments Pijpe et al. , 2008 . In some cases , SR2 butterflies seem to have an even higher sod2 expression compared to SR1 . Remarkably , the starvation survival analysis suggests that SR2 butterflies live even longer than SR1 . This could be explained by a different distribution of active sod2 alleles over the replicate selection lines Tyler et al. , 1993 . In addition , sod2 expression declines later in the SR lines relative to the Stock line . Provided that the SR and Stock lines were closely matched in physiological age , this is evidence of a changed regulatory control of sod2 in the selected lines as a result of selection . 4.3 . catalase We hypothesised a role of catalase in maintenance and the evolution of stress resistance in B. anynana . Based on the linked role in ROS physiology , we expected gene expression to change in concert with sod2 . We show up-regulation of catalase expression under stress conditions , as was found before in D. melanogaster Foley and Luckinbill , 2001 . Moreover , there is a trend towards a linear relationship between duration of stress and the level of catalase expression . This contrasts with the results for sod2 expression , which is lowered under severe stress compared to mild stress . However , an expected up-regulation in the selected lines was not found consistently only one selected line shows this pattern . Given the observed higher starvation resistance in SR2 relative to SR1 , higher catalase expression may still be causally related to increased starvation resistance , working additive to increased sod2 expression . It is also worth noting that sod2 or catalase have been implicated in underpinning increased lifespan in D. melanogaster Foley and Luckinbill , 2001 Mockett et al. , 2001 . The results from this species suggest that genetic variation in catalase expression may be more subtle than for sod2 and may not be picked up in every selection experiment of the target traits . Thus , in contrast to sod2 , we find that catalase does not play an unequivocal role in the variation of survival under stress or optimal conditions . 5 . Conclusion We have measured the expression of three candidate ageing genes in different lines , under various conditions and at various ages . The variation in expression levels is very different for each gene but we can identify some important patterns . Firstly , the environment has a more profound effect on gene expression than variation in genotype , as was expected under such contrasting but realistic environments c.f. Li et al. , 2006 . Secondly , all genes show differential expression with increasing starvation . Notably , the expression of sod2 and catalase do not closely correlate but rather seem to reflect the consecutive role the two genes play in scavenging the ROS . Thirdly , line differences are found for some genes but not for all . Our study indicates that sod2 , but not Indy , may underpin standing genetic variation for survival under starvation and under optimal food environments in stocks of butterflies established from natural populations . The results for catalase are less conclusive because of the differences between the selected lines . Our results are relevant in the light of the list of candidates to be tested in human populations . Moreover , the results warrant the investigation of more populations of B. anynana , including wet-and dry-season populations . More candidate ageing gene sequences have recently become available for similar analyses that we are now conducting in various experimental set-ups .

Stem cells have varying degrees of differentiation potential i totipotency ability to form the embryo and the trophoblast of the placenta like fertilized eggs zygotes ii pluripotency ability to differentiate into almost all cells that arise from the three germ layers like human embryonic stem hES cells and induced pluripotent stem iPS cells iii multipotentiality capability of producing a limited range of differenti-ated cell lineages upon their location like most tissue-based stem cells and iv unipotentiality ability to generate one cell type like cells such as the epidermal stem cells and the spermatogonial cells of the testis . That is , a hierarchy of stem cells exists . In addition , human ES cell lines show variation in differ-entiation propensity Osafune et al. 2008 . iPS cells , another type of pluripotent stem cell , have been generated from somatic cells of different origin by retroviral transduction of four transcription factors Takahashi et al. 2007 Yu et al. 2007 . The estab-lished iPS cells have a wider variety of differentiation ability and gene expression when compared to ES cells Aoi et al. 2008 Lee et al. 2009 Kaichi et al . 2010 . However , a small proportion of these stem cells sometimes show spontaneous differentiation dur-ing serial passage . Therefore , to realize the potential for iPS cells to be utilized for cell therapy and as a valuable tool for drug discovery , it is necessary to monitor the status of these stem cells and to define their exact stage during processes of growth and ? or differentiation . Glycosylation is a critical post-or co-translational modification found in more than 50 % of eukaryotic proteins Budnik et al. 2006 . Thus , the glycome , which represents the total set of glycans expressed in a cell , is believed to be information-rich , as it varies among cell types , stages of development and differenti-ation , and even in the malignant transformation pro-cesses Varki 1993 . Lectins have long been used as tools to characterize cell surface glycans , such as for blood-group typing , tissue staining , lectin-probed blotting and flow cytometry Sharon Lis 2004 . The use of lectins in glycan profiling provides considerable advantages . A modern technology to discriminate gly-can profiling is lectin microarray analysis , which is an emerging technology that enables ultrasensitive detec-tion of multiplex lectin�glycan interactions Angeloni et al. 2005 Kuno et al. 2005 Pilobello et al. 2005 . The system developed by Kuno et al. 2005 is based on a unique principle , that is , the evanescent-field flu-orescence-detection principle , which has been used extensively for biosensors to study real-time binding events on the glass slide surfaces . Thus , the evanes-cent-field methods have greater advantage to analyze relatively weak interactions between lectins and glyco-proteins in a liquid phase at equilibrium . Furthermore , this method is applicable for the analysis of the physio-logical and pathological status of crude glycoproteins extracted from mammalian cells Ebe et al. 2006 Kuno et al. 2008 and cell surfaces Tateno et al. 2007 . Although the number of probes in lectin microarray is much smaller than in mRNA expression arrays , lectin microarray analysis enables high-through-put and sensitive analysis of a large set of biological samples and provides a snapshot of cell profiling . In this study , we further developed lectin microarray technology to define the status of somatic and pluripo-tent stem cells . The glycan-based comprehensive approach promises to be of great value , complement-ing more established methods such as gene expression analysis and epigenetic analysis . Results Lectin microarray analysis of mouse mesenchymal cells Mesenchymal stem cells are multipotent and therefore may be useful in cell-based therapy along with ES cells and iPS cells . Mesenchymal stem cell MSC lines [ 9-15c , osteoblasts KUSA-A1 , chondroblasts KUM5 and preadipocytes H-1 ? A ] were established from mouse bone marrow and were shown to retain potency both in vivo and in vitro Umezawa et al. 1991 Matsumoto et al. 2005 Sugiki et al. 2007 . To investi-gate their carbohydrate structures , we carried out a lec-tin microarray analysis of the cell membrane proteins . We quantified lectin signal using �Array-Pro Analyzer� software and calculated the average net intensities of three spots for each lectin on the chip Fig. 1A . Experiments with each cell line were performed in triplicate or quadruplicate . Four mesenchymal cell lines with different potencies showed differential lectin reactivities . 9-15c MSCs showed strong reactivity to wheat germ agglutinin WGA , Lycopersicon esculentum lectin LEL , concanavalin A ConA , Sambucus nigra agglutinin SNA and Ricinus communis agglutinin I RCA120 Fig. 1A and Fig. S1 in Supporting Infor-mation . These signal intensities by lectin microarray were consistent with mean fluorescent intensities by flow cytometric analysis Fig. 1B . We then performed hierarchical clustering analysis and principal compo-nent analysis PCA on the signal values of each lectin Fig. 1C , D . H-1 ? A preadipocytes can be distin-guished by KUM5 chondroblasts by lectin reactivities of GSL1A4 , GSL1B4 , BPL , PWM and MPA PC1 axis , and 9-15c MSCs can be distinguished by KUSA-A1 osteoblasts by SNA . These cell types were repro-ducibly categorized into independent distinct groups . Lectin microarray analysis of human mesenchymal cells Human MSCs harvested from a variety of tissues have the capability to differentiate into numerous tissue lin-eages despite the fact that they may have tissue-specific characteristics . To clarify relationship between the tissue-specific characters of mesenchymal cells and glycomics , we performed lectin microarray analysis LecChip� Fig. S1 in Supporting Information of mesenchymal cells derived from various tissues Fig. 2A . Signal intensities by lectin microarray were consistent with the mean fluorescent intensities analy-sis determined by flow cytometric analysis Fig. 2B . Hierarchical clustering analysis showed that human embryonic carcinoma NCR-G3 cells were reproduc-ibly categorized into an independent group red color in Fig. 2C , which is distinct from a group of mesen-chymal cells derived from a variety of tissues green color in Fig. 2C . In mesenchymal cells , bone mar-row - , placenta-and extra finger-derived mesenchy-mal cells were categorized into distinct groups labeled in yellow , orange and blue , respectively Fig. 2C .

Osteoblasts specifically reacted to Griffonia simplicifolia lectin I , isolectin GSL I A4 and its isolectin B4 that bind to a-GalNAc and a-Gal , respectively , Peanut agglutinin PNA that binds to Galb1-3GalNAc and Psophocarpus tetragonolobus lectin I PTL I that binds to a-GalNAc Fig. S1 in Supporting Information . These results suggested the lectin microarrays are a practical tool for glycan-based category of human mesenchymal cells , and that each cell type in the various cell lineages have specific carbohydrate structures . Lectin microarray analysis of hES cells To study glycans during differentiation of hES cells , we performed lectin microarray analysis with extracts from undifferentiated hES cells hES-3 , 8 , 9 provided Lectin microarray analysis of iPS cells We generated human iPS cell lines from MRC-5 embryonic lung fibroblasts Makino et al. 2009 Table S4 in Supporting Information and performed from Harvard University and differentiated hES cells after embryoid body formation EB Fig. S2 in sup-porting Information . The lectin microarray data after statistical analysis show that undifferentiated hES cells and differentiated cells EB were clearly categorized Fig. 3A . To select lectins to discriminate between ES pluripotent and EB nonpluripotent cells , we analyzed lectin signals using �pair-wise comparison means� based on FDR False Discovery Rate statistics . Three lectins [ MAL , PHA L and EEL that bind to Siaa2-3Galb1-4GlcNAc , tri ? tetra-antennary complex-type N-glycan and Gala1-3Gal , respectively ] could discriminate between the individual cell populations FDR 0.05 , fold-change 2.0 Fig. 3B . The signals of MAL and PHA L in hES population were lower than those in EB , whereas the EEL signal in ES was higher than that in EB Fig. 3C , D . lectin microarray analysis of these cells and their paren-tal MRC-5 cells . The iPS cell lines were clearly distin-guishable from their parental cell MRC-5 Fig. 4A , B . We then performed the lectin microarray analysis on iPS lines and their differentiated forms . All differenti-ated ES cells EB EB_H8 , EB_H9 and EB_H3 were categorized into the group including MRC-5 parental cells , and undifferentiated iPS cells were categorized into the same group with hES cells Fig. 4B . These results suggest that glycomic analysis using lectin micro-array presents a specific lectin profile for pluripotency . To define pluripotency of human ES and iPS cells , we constructed seven formulas with the combination of the selected three lectins , MAL , PHA L and EEL Table 1 , using the lectin microarray data of 3 hES cells and 3 differentiated cells EB as a training set Table S1 in Supporting Information . The criterion for classifying undifferentiated and differentiated from of pluripotent cells is as follows if Score value is 0 or equal to 0 , cells are categorized into �pluripotent� cell population , and if Score value is 0 , cells are categorized into �nonpluripotent ? differentiated� cell population . To evaluate the accuracy of these functions , we used the lectin microarray data of MRC-5-derived iPS cells and MRC-5 parental cells as a test set Table 2A and Table S2 in Supporting Information . Linear discri-minant function with the combination of PHA L and EEL Formula 6 F 1.75 � PHA L + 1.28 � EEL + 1.92 shows the highest accuracy 100 % of determination of pluripotency , followed by that of MAL and EEL Formula 5 F 2.45 � MAL + 1.23 � EEL + 1.45 97 % , whereas the discriminant Table 1 Discriminant functions 5 6 7 Table 2 Evaluation of discriminant functions function with the combination of three lectins For-mula 7 F 2.98 � MAL + 0.75 �PHA L + 1.44 � EEL + 0.70 and MAL and PHA L Formula 4 F 2.81 � MAL + 0.03 � PHA L +2.29 shows 86.6 % and 55.2 % , respectively . Determination with single lectins shows 94.0 % Formula 2 F 2.38 � PHA L + 3.46 , 55.2 % Formula 1 F 2.78 � MAL + 2.32 and 89.6 % Formula 3 F 2.59 � EEL + 1.25 accuracy . We then analyzed lectin profiles on iPS cells derived from amniotic mesoderm Nagata et al. 2009 Table 2B , Tables S3 and S5 in Supporting Informa-tion . Formula 6 with PHA L and EEL as variants generated the highest accuracy 100.0 % among the formulas generated . These results suggest that two lec-tins , EEL and PHA L , are most suitable to determine pluripotency of stem cells . To investigate if scores calculated from each formula are correlated with �plu-ripotency� , we performed RT-PCR analysis of stem cell-specific genes . Positive correlations were observed between the scores and expression of the OCT4 ? 3 and NANOG genes Fig. 4C . Discussion The goal of this study was to distinguish oligosaccha-ride structures that are increased in pluripotent and multipotent cell types . Categorization using lectin probes enabled us to distinguish between different stem cell potencies or to discriminate between undif-ferentiated and differentiated forms . These results could lead to the use of lectin profiling as a tool for the better understanding of cell identity . To date , global glycan profiles have been preferentially ana-lyzed by mass spectrometry Satomaa et al. 2009 Wollscheid et al. 2009 . Specifically , high-resolution mass spectrometry is the primary technique for char-acterizing the structures of individual glycans in most glycomic studies Satomaa et al. 2009 Alvarez-Manilla et al. 2010 . Mass spectrometry can also be employed to define sites of attachment of glycans to the under-lying protein scaffold . A major benefit of mass spectrometry is the detailed information it provides regarding the structure of a glycan . A drawback , however , is its relatively low throughput and the need for different experimental protocols for each glycan subtype . In contrast , lectin microarray can be employed to interrogate the glycome with much higher throughput and provide global information about the types of glycan epitopes that are present in the sample Kuno et al. 2005 Yue Haab 2009 Porter et al. 2010 . The high-throughput platform as well as satisfactory sensitivity allows rapid comparison of multiple glycomes in search of global changes that might motivate further mass spectrometry studies . Glycan-based quality control for cell therapy� Defining the states of pluripotent stem cells In cell-based therapy , lectin microarray is a practical tool for the quality control of stem cell products . Flow cytometric analysis and immunocytochemical analysis with single probes have been used in this regard , but the lectin microarray technique with multiple probes provides an opportunity to address this issue in a sim-ple , inexpensive and fast manner Katrlik et al. 2010 . Cell identity needs to be validated after each step of cell processing , i.e. , isolation , in vitro propagation , harvest-ing and transfer because cells may be modified or chan-ged after either of these steps and should thus be monitored by the most trustworthy method . Human ES and iPS cells for potential use as donor cells in cell-based therapy need to be validated for maintenance of the �undifferentiated� state during in vitro propagation and while stored in master and working cell banks Wobus Boheler 2005 Yamanaka 2009 . Lectin microarray techniques for precise monitoring of the undifferentiated or differentiated state are indeed sensitive and only a small number of cells 1 � 103 are sufficient to obtain reproducible results . This feature of the technology , to define diverse cell identities , also leads to high-throughput screening for drug discovery and toxicology and safety testing . Glycan profile to determine cell identity Hematopoietic stem cells were originally defined by GlcNAc-specific wheat germ agglutinin WGA , one of the most common plant lectins Spangrude et al. 1988 , and human and murine endothelial cells were defined by another lectin , a1-2Fuc-specific Ulex euro-paeus agglutinin I UEA-I Jackson et al. 1990 . Neu-ral stem cells were also defined by the glycolipid antigen LeX ? SSEA-1 Capela Temple 2002 . Fur-thermore , human ES and iPS cells have been previ-ously evaluated by the presence of carbohydrate markers . The International Stem Cell Initiative char-acterized 59 human ES cell lines from 17 laboratories worldwide . Human ES cell lines are characterized by carbohydrate markers such as the glycolipid antigens SSEA3 and SSEA4 , and the keratan sulfate antigens TRA-1-60 , TRA-1-81 , GCTM2 and GCT343 as well as the protein antigens Adewumi et al. 2007 Wright Andrews 2009 . In addition to detection of carbohydrate markers by lectins and antibody probes , comprehensive glycan analysis serves as another method to detect and define cell identities . In this study , we found the pluripotent stem cells have the specific glycan structure , Gala1-3Gal , recognized by EEL Fig. S1 in Supporting Information . Their major specific N-glycosylation feature in hES cells is complex fucosylation Satomaa et al. 2009 , whereas PHA E ligands are signs of hES cell differentiation Venable et al. 2005 Wearne et al. 2006 . This study suggests that glycan profiling by lectin microarray is more sensitive , compared with any other analysis . Further analysis of stem cell glycan may also lead to establishing new glycan structures as stem cell markers in addition to the commonly used SSEA and TRA glycan structures . Glycans function as ligands for specific glycan recep-tors and modulate the activity of their carrier proteins and lipids Imperiali O�Connor 1999 Zanetta Vergoten 2003 . More than half of all proteins in a human cell are glycosylated . Consequently , a global change in protein-linked glycan biosynthesis can simul-taneously modulate the properties of multiple proteins . It is likely that drastic changes during differentiation of human stem cells have major influences on a number of cellular signaling cascades and affect biological pro-cesses within the cells Xu et al. 2005 Sasaki et al . 2008 . Thus , glycan profiling can be useful for valida-tion of cell identity Satomaa et al. 2009 . Categoriza-tion of stem cells by lectin microarray analysis can become another fundamental method in addition to immunocytochemistry and flow cytometric analysis . Microarray technologies currently enhance our under-standing of gene expression , genomic stability and epi-genetics , are commonly used in research laboratories and clinics today , and will likely play important roles in advancing stem cell research . In the future , analysis of stem cell glycan structure may be useful for establishing new markers beyond the lectin markers that already play a major role in the rapidly evolving world of stem cell biology .

The cells were maintained in POWEREDBY10 medium MED SHIROTORI CO. , Ltd , Tokyo , Japan or Iscove�s modified Dulbecco�s medium IMDM supplemented with 20 % fetal bovine serum and penicillin 100 lg ? mL ? strep-tomycin 100 lg ? mL ? amphotericin B 250 ng ? mL at 33 �C with 5 % CO2 . Human mesenchymal cells were maintained in DMEM Sigma , St. Louis , MO supplemented with 100 lg ? mL penicillin , 100 IU ? mL streptomycin and 10 % fetal calf serum at 37 �C in a CO2 incubator . Human embryonal carcinoma cell line NCR-G3 , from a testicular tumor , was cultured in G031101 medium Med Shirotori , Tokyo , Japan as previously described Maruyama et al. 1996 Umezawa et al. 1996 . Human iPS cells were cultured in Valuegen medium Med Shirotori , Tokyo , Japan Makino et al. 2009 Nagata et al. 2009 . Cells 0.1�1 � 106 were washed with PBS and collected with a cell scraper . Cell pellets of hES-3 , -8 , and -9 cells Osafune et al. 2008 were kindly obtained from Dr Douglas Melton Harvard University . Cell membrane fractions were extracted from the cell pellets using a CelLytic MEM Protein Extraction kit Sigma , St Louis , MO , USA . Lectin microarray analysis was performed as previously described Kuno et al. 2005 , 2008 . Briefly , a small aliquot of protein fraction 200 ng was labeled with Cy3-succinimidyl ester designated as Cy3-labeled glycoprotein . The lectin chip with 43 lectins Kuno et al. 2005 for mouse cells or LecChip� with 45 lectins GP Bio-Sciences , Kanagawa , Japan for human cells was incubated with the Cy3-labeled glycoprotein solution 100 lL at a con-centration of 0.25 and 0.5 lg ? mL in probing buffer TBS con-taining 0.05 % Triton X-100 at 4 �C until binding reached equilibrium . Lectins are well known as glycan recognizers and are classified into several categories , for instance , fucose , sialic acid , asialo-form , agalacto-form , high mannose , O-glycan and branching structure recognizers Fig. S1 in Supporting Infor-mation . We calculated the net intensity value for each spot by subtracting a background value from signal intensity and then averaged the signal net intensity values of three spots . Lectin microarray data on each cell type were processed by the microarray system using a max-normalization procedure after a gain-merging process Kuno et al. 2008 . To analyze the lectin microarray data , we used agglomerative hierarchical clustering and principal component analysis PCA Sharov et al. 2005 . The hierarchical clustering techniques classify data by similarity and their results are represented by dendrograms . PCA is a multivariate analysis technique that finds major patterns in data variability .

21164520	www.nature.com cdd Mesenchymal stem cells MSCs are multipotent mesoderm-derived somatic stem cell SSC precursors of non-hemato-poietic connective tissues that are present in the stroma of virtually all mammalian organs , especially bone marrow and subcutaneous fat reviewed in Bernardo et al.1 . Upon activation by tissue damage , MSCs contribute to tissue-repair processes through a multitude of activities , including cell proliferation , differentiation and migration , and the regulation of angiogenesis and immune responses . There is growing evidence , in both animal and clinical models , that administra-tion of ex vivo-expanded human MSCs hMSCs has potential to ameliorate many degenerative disorders however , the specific molecular mechanisms underlying this therapeutic potential remain mostly unknown . MicroRNAs miRNAs are an extensive family of small 18�24 nucleotide , single-stranded non-coding RNAs , which regulate gene expression in eukaryotic cells by controlling the translation usually by repression , stability and localization of specific mRNA targets . Computational predictions of miRNA targets indicate that each miRNA regulates hundreds of mRNAs , and that approximately one third of all mammalian protein-coding genes are regulated by miRNAs.2 Functional studies show that miRNAs participate in virtually each cellular process investigated , and that alterations in their expression levels might underlie human diseases , including cardiovas-cular disease and cancer . There are also data indicating that mammalian miRNAs can be imported into the nucleus3 or even secreted from cells within small exocytic particles , 4 suggesting the existence of currently unknown functions for this class of molecules . Experimental evidence shows that miRNAs are critical regulators of stem cell biology . In mouse embryonic stem ES cells , knockout of Dicer or DGCR8 , two key protein factors involved in miRNA biogenesis , impairs cell growth , with cells accumulating in G1 , and severely reduces differentiation capacity.5,6 Additionally , expression profiling demonstrates that ES cells express a unique repertoire of miRNAs compared with differentiated cell types.7 Molecular functions of ES cell-specific miRNAs have begun to be elucidated , and the results confirm their critical involvement in the regulation of ES cell pluripotency and self-renewal . miRNAs also have an important role in controlling ES cell differentiation and commitment.8 To date , relatively few studies have examined miRNA function in MSCs . Gene expression microarray profiling has identified several miRNAs that are regulated during differ-entiation of MSCs into different cell lineages . Some of these miRNAs have been identified as regulators of osteogenic differentiation , including miR-125b , 9 miR-26a , 10 miR-196a , 11 miR-204 21112 and miRs-148b , -27a and -489.13 Also , miR-335 has been recently identified as the most upregulated miRNA in bone marrow-derived hMSCs in comparison with skin fibroblasts , 14 which are otherwise phenotypically similar to hMSCs . However , the specific targets of most of these miRNAs remain to be determined , and the possible role of miRNAs in other therapeutically relevant MSC activities , such as in cell migration and proliferation , is unknown . Here , we sought to identify miRNAs that may regulate the activation of the reparative phenotype of hMSCs , as well as some of their target genes . Results miR-335 is downregulated upon hMSC differentiation . We hypothesized that key miRNA regulators of MSC activation differentiation in tissue repair should be expressed in the undifferentiated state , and downregulated early upon exposure to a differentiation signal . To identify these putative miRNAs , we used Agilent microarrays to obtain differential miRNA expression profiles of undifferentiated bone marrow-derived hMSCs versus the same cells cultured in the presence of adipogenic or osteogenic media . We also profiled human skin fibroblasts , since the target miRNAs should be expressed at comparatively low levels in more developmentally restricted mesenchymal cell types . As we aimed to identify miRNAs potentially involved in the initial steps of hMSC activation differentiation , cells were exposed to differentiation media for a relatively short period 9 days , instead of the 21 days commonly used for in vitro MSC differentiation assays . Signal processing is a critical step in the analysis of the results of miRNA microarray experiments . We used a normalization algorithm that incorporates quantile normal-ization between arrays15 to estimate a processed miRNA signal for the Agilent arrays . The quantile normalization , when applied to the background-corrected signal , showed signifi-cantly lower variability between replicates than the total gene signal normalized by the 75 % percentile Supplementary Figure S1 . The results showed no significant regulation false discovery rate , fdro15 % of miRNAs previously described as regu-lators of osteogenic miR-26a , miR-27a , miR-125b , miR-148b , miR-196a and miR-489 or adipogenic differentiation miR-103 , miR-107 and miR-143 under any of the conditions tested Supplementary Figure S2A Supplementary Table S1 . Gene enrichment analysis of the predicted targets of miRNAs up-or downregulated in at least two conditions see Materials and methods showed a significant Po1E�06 enrichment for genes involved in angiogenesis or signaling by Wnt , integrins , PDGF , cadherin , endothelin and TGF-b Supplementary Figure S2B Supplementary Table S1 . miR-335 was the only miRNA significantly downregulated in all three �differentiated� cell populations Figure 1a . Fold-change log2 values were as follows fibroblast versus undifferentiated hMSCs , M ? 5.684 fdr ? 0.008 osteo-genic differentiation versus undifferentiated , M ? 2.434 fdr ? 0.029 adipogenic differentiation versus undifferen-tiated , M ? 1.141 fdr ? 0.103 . After validating the micro-array results by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction RT-PCR Figure 1b , we selected miR-335 for further characterization . miR-335 levels were also significantly reduced in human osteoblasts Saos-2 cell line after differentiation Supple-mentary Figure S4 . hMSCs from different tissues express higher levels than fibroblasts of miR-335 and its host gene MEST . To determine whether relatively high expression of miR-335 is specific to bone marrow-derived hMSCs or is a common characteristic of hMSCs , we analyzed miR-335 expression levels in hMSC populations obtained from bone marrow , subcutaneous adipose tissue and articular cartilage Figure 2b . All hMSC isolates were tested at passage 5�7 at the same cell density 8000 cells cm2 , and were assayed for their differentiation potential to osteogenic , adipogenic and chondrogenic lineages in the presence of specific differentiation factors data not shown . All three populations express significantly higher levels of miR-335 than dermal fibroblasts , and miR-335 expression levels were significantly higher in hMSCs isolated from bone marrow or articular cartilage than in hMSCs derived from adipose tissue . miR-335 is encoded by the second intron of the MEST mesoderm-specific transcript homolog gene Figure 2a .16 MEST expression , determined by real-time RT-PCR , correlated with the levels of mature miR-335 Figure 2b Spearman�s r ? 0.5769 , P ? 0.0008 , suggesting that the different hMSC isolates co-express mature miR-335 with its host gene and not through an MEST-independent mechanism such as a specific promoter or post-transcriptional regulation . MEST expression levels also correlated with the levels of miR-335 under all other conditions tested in this study Supplementary Figure S5 . miR-335 impairs hMSC proliferation , migration and differentiation . We next analyzed the effect of miR-335 overexpression in bone marrow-derived hMSCs . hMSCs were transduced with the lentiviral vector pLV-EmGFP-MIR335 , which encodes the genomic sequence spanning miR-335 , or with a control vector pLV-EmGFP-Mock . Transduced cells were purified to 495 % homogeneity gfp-positive cells by fluorescence-activated cell sorting FACS . To avoid non-specific effects due to lentiviral gene silencing or to a high proviral copy number per cell , a multiplicity of infection MOI of 5 was used , and only cells with medium-level gfp expression were selected Supplementary Figure S3A . Real-time RT-PCR demonstrated an B3-fold increase in miR-335 expression in pLV-EmGFP-MIR335-transduced cells compared with controls Supplementary Figure S3B . When cultured over several passages , miR-335-over-expressing hMSCs showed a significant reduction in their proliferative activity compared with control cells Figure 3a . However , miR-335 overexpression did not cause significant alterations to cell cycle kinetics not shown or the rate of apoptosis Figure 3b . hMSCs overexpressing miR-335 also showed an impaired migratory response to stimulation with fetal bovine serum Figure 3c . Consistently , wild-type hMSCs transfected with an miR-335 inhibitor Anti-miR-335 , Ambion , Austin , TX , USA showed increased migratory activity compared with cells transfected with a negative control Anti-miR oligonucleo-tide Figure 3c Supplementary Figure S3C . miR-335-over-expressing hMSCs also showed impaired migratory activity in an in vitro wound-healing assay compared with control cells see Supplementary information videos . These results demonstrate that miR-335 is a negative regulator of hMSC migration . The effect of miR-335 expression on hMSC differentiation capacity was monitored by comparing the in vitro differentia-tion responses of control and miR-335-transduced hMSCs to exposure to adipogenic or osteogenic stimuli for 3 weeks . Both adipogenic and osteogenic differentiation were signifi-cantly reduced by miR-335 overexpression . In particular , in vitro osteogenesis was almost completely abolished Figure 3d , indicating a role for miR-335 in the regulation of hMSC differentiation programs . Analysis of expression of the differentiation markers osteopontin osteogenic differentia-tion and PPARg adipogenic differentiation confirmed the inhibitory effect of miR-335 in both processes Figure 3e . miR-335 expression levels are regulated by signals that control MSC migration and differentiation . The apparent regulatory role of miR-335 in hMSC suggested that it might be regulated by signals known to control MSC biology . We therefore tested if canonical Wnt signaling , a negative regulator of MSC differentiation , 17 affected miR-335 expression levels . Bone marrow-derived hMSCs treated with 10 mM LiCl or Wnt3a-containing conditioned medium upregulated miR-335 expression Figure 4a , left panel . Moreover , addition of Dkk1 100 ng ml , a specific inhibitor of canonical Wnt signaling , significantly decreased miR-335 expression in the presence of exogenous Wnt3a Figure 4a , right panel . Upregulation of miR-335 expression by Wnt3a was also observed in adipose-derived hMSCs and in skin fibroblasts Figure 4b , although in a different extension , suggesting that this effect is common to all mesenchymal cell types . We next evaluated the effect on miR-335 expression of interferon-g IFN-g signaling , another key regulator of MSC activity . IFN-g has numerous actions on MSC , including the induction of immunorregulatory activity , cell migration and osteogenic differentiation.18,19 Treatment of bone marrow-derived hMSCs with human IFN-g for 48 h signifi-cantly decreased expression of miR-335 Figure 4c in a dose-dependent manner , consistent with the lowered miR-335 expression during cell migration and osteogenic differentiation . To identify possible binding sites in the MEST locus for transcription factors involved in b-catenin or IFNg signaling pathways , we performed a multispecies human , mouse and dog sequence homology analysis for conserved binding sites for LEF TCF transcription factors involved in b-catenin signaling and STAT1 involved in IFNg signaling . MULAN analysis with a matrix similarity of 0.95 showed one possible LEF1 and one possible TCF4 site in the 5-kb region upstream of the MEST transcriptional start site corresponding to the longest human splicing variant , both mapping at 2675 kb Supplementary Figure S6 . A similar analysis , with a matrix similarity of 0.90 , identified three conserved potential STAT1-binding sites at 4440 , 4384 and 4303 kb Supplementary Figure S6 . Potential miR-335 targets in hMSCs are enriched in transcription regulators of cell movement and differentiation . In order to identify potential miR-335 targets , we used a two-step approach Figure 5a . First , we employed three different miRNA target prediction programs , miRanda , 20 TargetScan21 and PicTar , 22 to obtain a list of putative miR-335 targets . As these programs use different target scoring systems , we combined the three lists in a single non-redundant gene list a total of 1838 genes , of which 1607 were mapped . Gene enrichment analysis using the PANTHER database revealed significant enrichment Po0.001 for molecular functions related to transcriptional and post-transcriptional gene regulation , and for biological processes Po1E�06 also related to regulatory activities , including mRNA transcription , protein modification and signal transduction Supplementary Figure S7 . Second , we performed a microarray gene expression analysis Agilent Whole Human Genome Microarray Kit on hMSCs transduced with pLV-EmGFP-MIR335 or pLV-EmGFP-mock . We focused on downregulated genes since mRNA expression levels tend to correlate negatively with the expression levels of their specific miRNAs.23 Using this approach , we identified 489 genes with decreased expression in miR-335-transduced cells that are thus candidate direct or indirect targets of this miRNA in hMSCs . Of these genes , 62 were also contained in the previously obtained list of predicted miR-335 targets Supplementary Table S2 , and were there-fore classed as probable direct targets . This set of 62 genes was significantly enriched Po0.05 for transcription factors 21 % and membrane-bound signaling molecules 6.5 % . A detailed analysis with the Ingenuity Pathways Analysis software IPA , Ingenuity Systems , Redwood City , CA , USA , http www.ingenuity.com showed a predominant enrichment for functions involved in cell development , cell movement , gene expression and the cell cycle Benjamini�Hochberg multiple test-corrected P-value ? 1.37E 02�8.82E�02 . Other significantly enriched biological functions included cell signaling , cell growth and proliferation , cell morphology , cell commitment and cell death Table 1 . Using IPA , the two more representative gene regulatory networks were constructed , respectively , containing 11 of the 20 potential miR-335 target genes involved in cellular movement score 27 and 15 of the 17 genes involved in gene expression score 42 Figure 5b . One of the predicted targets of miR-335 is RUNX2 , a key transcription factor involved in osteogenesis . Although miRNAs can bind to coding regions and even to 50regulatory regions , a single miR-335 binding site is predicted by the miRanda algorithm at nucleotides 3545�3567 in all the known Table 1 Most significantly enriched molecular and cellular functions found using the IPA software in the list of 62 genes identified as potential miR-335 targets in hMSCs B-H P-value Benjamini�Hochberg multiple test-corrected P-value Relevant functions B-H P-value No. of Molecules RUNX2 transcript variants GenGank Accession Numbers NM_001024630 , NM_001015051 , NM_004348 , correspond-ing to the 30UTR region . A western blot analysis of RUNX2 demonstrated that its protein levels are reduced in hMSCs by miR-335 exogenous overexpression Figure 6a . To determine whether miR-335 directly modulates RUNX2 expression levels in hMSCs , we cloned the full-length RUNX2 30UTR downstream of the Renilla luciferase gene as a reporter , and assayed its expression in hMSCs transfected with a synthetic precursor or a specific inhibitor of miR-335 . UTR reporters correspond-ing to SOX4 and UBE2F genes were used as positive and negative controls , respectively , for the miR-335 inhibitory activity.24 Transfection of the miR-335 synthetic precursor significantly reduced the expression of UTR reporters for SOX4 and RUNX2 , but not the expression of the negative control gene UBE2F Figure 6b , upper panel . Transfection with the specific inhibitor of miR-335 significantly increased the expression levels of UTR reporters for SOX4 and RUNX2 , but did not affect the levels of UBE2F Figure 6b , bottom panel . These results indicate that miR-335 controls RUNX2 expression in hMSCs by direct binding to its 30UTR . Finally , we have quantified the relative expression levels of RUNX2 after osteogenic differentiation in hMSCs overexpressing miR-335 . The results of these experiments Figure 6c showed a significant reduction of RUNX2 expression levels in the cells transduced with the lentiviral vector encoding miR-335 , compared with those transduced with a control lentiviral vector , which is in good agreement with the rest of the data indicating that RUNX2 is a target of miR-335 in hMSCs . Discussion Our results support a central role for miR-335 in the gene regulatory network that controls the tissue-repair activities of hMSCs . Expression of this miRNA is high in undifferentiated multipotent hMSCs compared with their differentiated cell progeny , and is regulated by major signaling pathways that control MSC biology , such as those controlled by Wnt3a and IFNg . The set of predicted miR-335 targets is enriched in genes whose products are regulators of cellular movement and gene expression , including RUNX2 , involved in the control of osteogenic differentiation . There is growing evidence that miRNAs have a critical role in the biology of all stem cell types , including ES cells , germline stem cells and SSCs . As SSCs are usually less well defined than embryonic or germline stem cells , it has been difficult to identify the specific roles of an miRNA in a particular SSC population . Most miRNAs described as regulators of SSC biology are inducers of cell differentiation commitment or inhibitors of self-renewal and proliferation , while others seem to be involved in the self-renewal or maintenance of some SSC types.25 Our results demonstrate that miR-335 is downregulated in hMSC cultures undergoing adipogenic or osteogenic differ-entiation , and is also expressed at comparatively lower levels in skin fibroblasts , which are mesenchymal cells with a limited differentiation potential . Our data are in complete accordance with previous work identifying miR-335 as the most upregu-lated miRNA in bone marrow-derived hMSCs in comparison with fibroblasts.14 Until recently , the only known specific biological role for miR-335 is in human breast cancer , where it has been proposed as a metastasis suppressor.24 Expression of miR-335 is lost in the majority of primary breast tumors from patients who relapse , and this is associated with poor distal metastasis-free survival.24 These results are in good agree-ment with our findings demonstrating that miR-335 is a negative regulator of hMSC migration . miR-335 downregula-tion is also observed in drug-resistant ovarian cancer cells , 26 cultured chondrocytes versus cartilage tissue , 27 ethanol-treated neural progenitors , 28 multiple myeloma cells and tumors29 and muscle regeneration.30 In contrast , miR-335 is highly expressed in obesity models31 and in fetal lung compared with adult tissue.32 During the preparation of this manuscript , a communication describing the direct targeting of RB1 by miR-335 has been published.33 In this study , the authors establish the important role of this miRNA in the induction of p53-dependent cell cycle arrest after DNA damage . These results are in accordance with our findings demonstrating that miR-335 is a negative regulator of hMSC proliferation , and , taken together with our results , suggest an important role of miR-335 RB1 activity in regulation activation of hMSC tissue-repair activities . miR-335 is encoded by the second intron of the maternally imprinted gene MEST human chromosome 7q32 .16 Our results demonstrate that both miR-335 and MEST are coordinately upregulated in hMSCs from three different tissues bone marrow , subcutaneous fat and articular cartilage in comparison with skin fibroblasts . The biological relevance of this finding remains to be determined , but our results suggest that miR-335 expression levels could be used to discriminate between hMSCs and fibroblasts , or even between different MSC populations with diverse differentia-tion potentials . We found no significant regulation of miRNAs previously described as regulators of osteogenic differentiation miR-26a , miR-27a , miR-125b , miR-148b , miR-196a , miR-489 and miR-204 211 or adipogenic differentiation miR-103 , miR-107 and miR-143 under any of the conditions tested . This apparent discrepancy with published data might be related to the fact that our microarray analyses were performed on hMSCs at early differentiation stages , unlike other studies that used terminally differentiated MSCs . Also , the method we used for signal processing quantile normalization 15 probably contributed to an overall reduction in the variation of gene expression between samples . The finding that miR-335 expression impairs the prolifera-tive and migratory capacities of primary bone marrow-derived hMSCs and inhibits both adipogenic and osteogenic differ-entiation suggests that miR-335 is part of a common regulatory pathway for cell proliferation , migration and differentiation in MSCs . The existence of a partially over-lapping regulatory circuitry for these biological processes has already been demonstrated in MSCs , 17 as well as in other SSC lineages.34 The role of canonical Wnt signaling pathway Wnt3a as a positive regulator of miR-335 expression in hMSCs agrees with the evidence showing that Wnt3a inhibits osteogenic differentiation in MSCs.17 However , the observed reduction in proliferation capacity in hMSCs overexpressing miR-335 suggests that the reported proliferative effect of Wnt3a acts via miR-335-independent mechanisms . Also , it has been reported that Wnt3a induces ECM invasion in hMSCs , 35 although it inhibits it in murine MSCs.36 Further studies are needed to determine the effects of Wnt3a in the migration capacity of hMSCs in different regulatory condi-tions , and if they are related to miR-335 upregulation . In contrast with the effect of Wnt3a , IFNg decreased miR-335 expression in hMSCs . Considered together with the anti-migratory and differentiation effects of miR-335 , this action might account , at least partially , for the previously described pro-migratory and pro-osteogenic activities of IFNg.19 This cytokine has a key role in the therapeutic activity of MSCs , as it is involved in the activation of their immunomodulatory phenotype.18 IFNg signaling , both inter-cellular and autocrine , might thus regulate an unsuspected large number of genes in MSCs through the inhibition of miR-335 expression . At this time , we do not know the precise molecular mechanism by which IFNg downregulates miR-335 expression in MSC , but it might involve an indirect effect through its previously described inhibitory action on the canonical Wnt signaling pathway.37 Comparative genomics is a powerful new tool for identifying and characterizing functional sequences . The presence in the 50 upstream region of the MEST locus of highly conserved potential LEF1 and TCF4-binding sites 95 % similarity between human , mouse and dog and potential STAT1-binding sites is compatible with the regulation of the MEST miR-335 locus by both Wnt3a and IFNg . Consistent with our experimental results , the set of 62 potential direct gene targets of miR-335 is significantly enriched in genes related to cell movement and gene expression , pointing to a key regulatory role of miR-335 in MSC biology . In particular , we have experimentally validated RUNX2 , a transcription factor essential for osteogenic differentiation , as a direct miR-335 target . Recently , miR-204 and miR-211 have been described as negative regu-lators of RUNX2.12 Taken together , these results demonstrate that osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal precursors is regulated by multiple miRNAs through the control of RUNX2 expression levels . To our knowledge , this is the first demonstration of the involvement of a specific miRNA in the coordinated regulation of MSC proliferation , migration and differentiation . Our findings are summarized in the model presented in Figure 7 . miR-335 is downregulated in MSCs in response to tissue damage signals , such as IFNg , which leads to de-repression of miR-335 target genes involved in MSC proliferation , migration and osteogenic differentiation . These results have implications for the understanding of the major molecular mechanisms controlling the therapeutic activity of hMSCs versus their maintenance in an undifferentiated state , and strongly suggest an important role of miR-335 in tissue homeostasis . Materials and Methods Cell culture . This study was carried out according to the guidelines of the Instituto de Salud Carlos III Spain . hMSCs from bone marrow , adipose tissue and articular cartilage were isolated and characterized as previously described.38 Human skin fibroblasts were obtained from Inbiobank San Sebastian , � Spain . The 293T and the Saos-2 cell lines were purchased from The American Type Culture Collection CRL-11268 , Manasas , VA , USA . All cell lines were maintained in expansion medium , consisting of Dulbecco�s modified Eagle�s medium supplemented with 1 g l D-glucose , supplemented with 10 % heat-inactivated fetal calf serum FCS , 2 mM L-glutamine and 50 mg ml gentamicin all culture reagents were from Invitrogen Carlsbad , CA , USA . Cells were cultured in a humidified 371C incubator at 5 % CO2 . For Wnt stimulation , cells were exposed to different concentrations of conditioned medium from Wnt3a-expressing QT6 cells .

In healthy tissues homeostasis , physiological levels of Wnt3a , in co-ordination with other stimuli , keep miR-335 expression levels high in MSCs . Upon tissue damage or challenge , IFNg , probably also in combination with other proinflammatory signals , induce miR-335 downregulation , which in turns causes the de-repression of its target genes , RUNX2 among them . This activates the MSC reparative phenotype , characterized by an increased proliferative , migratory and differentiation capacities
