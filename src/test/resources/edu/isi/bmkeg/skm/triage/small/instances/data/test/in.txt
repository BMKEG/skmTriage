20300113	www.nature.com cdd Glucocorticoid hormones and their synthetic derivatives , prednisone and dexamethasone , readily induce cell killing in lymphocytes.1�3 Glucocorticoid-induced cell death is primarily mediated by a receptor-dependent mechanism that results in apoptosis or necrosis.4�6 During this process , the ligand-bound glucocorticoid receptor GR translocates to the nucleus to transactivate or repress gene transcription.7,8 Thus , glucocorticoid sensitivity may be characterized , in part , by transcriptional changes in genes that regulate the cell death process.5 In T cells , glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis is antagonized by the activation of T cell receptor TCR signaling.9�12 After TCR activation , the lymphocyte cell-specific tyrosine kinase Lck translocates to the cell surface and phosphorylates immunoreceptor tyrosine activation motifs on the TCR.13,14 This results in a phosphorylation cascade that leads to the activation of phospholipase Cg , generation of IP3 , and intracellular calcium release from IP3 receptor channels.15 In addition , we have recently shown that Lck interacts with IP3 receptors to positively regulate IP3-mediated calcium signals.16 Calcium , in turn , functions to activate calcineurin to dephos-phorylate NFAT , thereby inducing its translocation to the nucleus and stimulating transcription of proinflammatory cytokines.17 Importantly , calcium-dependent activation of calcineurin was shown to be an integral step in the inhibition of glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis.18 In addition , gluco-corticoids also suppress T-cell activation by rapidly inhibiting Src kinases Fyn and Lck , intracellular calcium release , and transcription of proinflammatory cytokines.19�23 Conse-quently , these events provide a negative regulatory mecha-nism whereby lymphocyte activation rescues cells from glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis , and conversely , gluco-corticoids inhibit downstream TCR-dependent signaling . Because of its role in regulating cell proliferation and survival , Lck , similar to Src , acts as a protooncogene to facilitate cellular transformation , 24 and is overexpressed in Burkitt and non-Hodgkin�s B-cell lymphoma , as well as myeloid and lymphocytic leukemias.25�29 Although Lck has previously been shown to block apoptosis induced by TCR crosslinking or proinflammatory cytokines , 30 it has not been investigated whether Lck directly affects glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis . On conducting microarray analysis of normal and malignant T cells , we discovered that dexametha-sone downregulates Lck in a manner that is sufficient to inhibit TCR signaling . Moreover , glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis was enhanced in cells that stably expressed Lck shRNAs or were treated with the Src inhibitor dasatinib . In contrast , primary chronic lymphocytic leukemia CLL cells that undergo ligand-independent calcium signaling aber-rantly expressed Lck and were completely resistant to its downregulation by dexamethasone . Although CLL cells were relatively insensitive to glucocorticoids , Lck inhibition signi-ficantly enhanced response to dexamethasone , suggesting a novel means to reverse glucocorticoid resistance in lymphoid malignancy . Results Dexamethasone downregulates Lck expression to inhibit TCR signaling . In our effort to identify candidate genes that were regulated by glucocorticoids , we conducted microarray analysis of dexamethasone-treated thymocytes , S49.A2 , and WEHI7.2 murine T-lymphoma cells . Each of these T-cell populations have shown to be highly sensitive to the effects of dexamethasone.5 Microarray analysis revealed several genes that were upregulated by dexamethasone and that contributed , in part , to the induction of apoptosis.31,32 Interestingly , Lck was discovered to be among a cluster of genes that were downregulated by dexamethasone in each of these T-cell populations . In primary thymocytes , Lck mRNA levels were downregulated by over 80 % Figure 1 . Among 57 genes that were downregulated by greater than or equal to twofold , excluding those that were hypothetical or unknown , only eight were downregulated by a stronger degree of magnitude . To confirm that Lck was in fact down-regulated by glucocorticoids in normal and malignant T cells , we measured its expression by real-time quantitative PCR qPCR Figure 2a and b and then by western blotting in WEHI7.2 cells , primary thymocytes , and the T-cell leukemia line CEMC7 Figure 2c�e . Simultaneous treatment with dexamethasone and the GR antagonist RU486 prevented Lck downregulation , indicating that it is repressed by a GR-dependent mechanism Figure 2c . To determine whether the downregulation of Lck by dexamethasone was sufficient for the induction of apoptosis , we knocked down Lck expression in WEHI7.2 cells using a lentiviral shRNA approach . Results from these experiments showed no differences in baseline apoptosis between control and Lck shRNA cells 3.9�0.49 % compared with 4.7� 0.56 % , respectively , P ? 0.33 , indicating that downregulation of Lck alone is not sufficient for apoptosis to occur . Similar levels of apoptosis were also observed in Lck and Fyn double knockdown cells , ruling out the possibility that another Src family member for example , Fyn compensates for decreased expression of Lck data not shown . In contrast , we found that the downregulation of Lck by dexamethasone was sufficient to inhibit both ligand-indepen-dent unstimulated and anti-CD3-induced calcium oscilla-tions in WEHI7.2 cells Figure 3a�c . To mimic the effect of dexamethasone on Lck , we transiently knocked down its expression using gene-specific siRNAs . When Lck expres-sion was decreased by X70 % , calcium oscillations were reduced in a similar manner as with dexamethasone treat-ment Figure 3d�f . Together , these data indicate that the downregulation of Lck is sufficient for glucocorticoid-mediated inhibition of TCR-induced calcium signaling but not apoptosis . On the basis of these findings , we predicted that the Src kinase inhibitor , dasatinib , would also suppress TCR signaling by inhibiting Lck activity . The ability of dasatinib to inhibit T-cell activation has been previously shown in normal peripheral blood lymphocytes.33 We determined that 100 nM dasatinib was the optimal concentration for inhibiting Lck phosphory-lation at its activating tyrosine residue Y394 , given that phosphorylation at this site was inhibited by 490 % Figure 4a . As anticipated , dasatinib markedly inhibited TCR signaling , as assessed by anti-CD3-induced calcium oscillations as well as by MEK and ERK phosphorylation Figure 4b�d . Dexamethasone and dasatinib synergistically inhibit TCR signaling . Although dasatinib and dexamethasone both regulate Lck by distinct mechanisms , we asked whether these agents might function synergistically to inhibit phosphorylation of Src family kinases . Importantly , glucocorticoids have also been shown to rapidly inhibit phosphorylation of both Lck and Fyn by a nongenomic mechanism.22,23 Thus , both dexamethasone and dasatinib are capable of inhibiting Lck phosphorylation status without affecting mRNA or protein levels , respectively . We found that both dexamethasone and dasatinib reduced Lck phosphory-lation at Y394 however , inhibition was substantially greater in the presence of dasatinib Figure 5a and b and phos-phorylation could not be detected in cells treated with both agents . Interestingly , both dexamethasone and dasatinib alone were sufficient to inhibit Lck phosphorylation at Y505 , the C-terminal negative regulatory site Figure 5a . Total levels of Lck and Fyn protein were downregulated by dexamethasone and substantially reduced in the presence of dexamethasone and dasatinib Figure 5a . These data suggest that dasatinib and dexamethasone cooperate synergistically to inhibit Src activity and expression . In support of this observation , we also noted that downstream TCR signaling proteins were affected in a similar manner . For example , ZAP-70 expression was downregulated by dexamethasone and dasatinib , as well as TCR adapter proteins LAT and SLP-76 Figure 5c . Downstream MAP kinase signaling was also inhibited by the combination of dexamethasone and dasatinib to a greater extent than either agent alone , as depicted by the loss in MEK1 2 phosphorylation Figure 5c . Lck inhibition enhances glucocorticoid sensitivity and apoptosis . Because TCR signaling antagonizes gluco-corticoid-induced apoptosis , 9�11 we investigated whether the combination of dexamethasone and dasatinib , which profoundly abrogates TCR signaling Figure 5 , would enhance overall cytotoxicity to dexamethasone . Accordingly , we observed that the IC50 for dexamethasone decreased by greater than fourfold when cells were also exposed to 100nM dasatinib Figure 6a . Although dasatinib alone was not cytotoxic in these cells Figure 6a , b , and d , the combination of dexamethasone and dasatinib markedly enhanced glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis Figure 6b�d . To determine whether the effect of dasatinib was specifically due to the inhibition of Lck , we tested whether WEHI7.2 cells , stably transduced with Lck shRNAs , would respond to dexamethasone in a similar manner . As shown in Figure 6e , Lck expression was markedly downregulated in cells transduced with shRNA and glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis was elevated relative to control cells Figure 6e . Collectively , these data indicate that Lck protects cells from glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis , and that Lck inhibition sensitizes T cells to the apoptotic effects of dexamethasone . Lck expression correlates with resistance to dexametha - sone in CLL cells . Because Lck inhibition by shRNAs or dasatinib enhanced glucocorticoid sensitivity in T cells , we tested whether Lck inhibition would also sensitize primary leukemia cells to dexamethasone . When conducting these experiments , we used CLL cells as a model of lymphoid malignancy because B-CLL i is the most commonly diag-nosed leukemia in the western hemisphere , ii is routinely treated with glucocorticoids , although responses are profoundly inferior to that of acute lymphoblastic leukemia ALL , 1�3,34 iii has aberrant expression of Lck , 29 and iv shows characteristics of ligand-independent BCR signaling.35,36 To confirm that CLL cells undergo ligand-independent signaling , we measured calcium responses in cells that were isolated from three individuals . Typical pro-survival calcium oscillations were detected in the absence of ligand stimula-tion , suggesting that these cells undergo constitutive BCR activation and signaling Figure 7a . We then determined that ex vivo responses to dexamethasone , in terms of overall cell killing , were significantly weakened relative to glucocorticoid-sensitive T cells Figure 7b . Lack of response to dexametha-sone was also shown in MEC1 cells , a prolymphocytoid CLL cell line Figure 7c . After measuring expression of Src kinases Lck , Lyn , and Fyn by real-time qPCR , we found that all three genes were expressed in CLL cells . However , only Lck was aberrantly elevated in all CLL samples N ? 10 compared with normal B cells by over one order of magnitude Figure 7d and e . Both normal thymocytes and malignant T-cell lines were included in the analysis as positive controls . Notably , several CLL samples expressed Lck at levels greater or equal to these T-cell populations Figure 7d . Lck was also elevated in peripheral blood lymphocytes isolated from a patient with circulating marginal zone lymphoma Figure 7d . Further analysis of protein levels confirmed that Lck was readily detectable in CLL but not in normal B cells Figure 7f , whereas Fyn and Lyn were detectable in both normal and malignant cells data not shown . These data confirm that Lck is aberrantly expressed in CLL cells that undergo ligand-independent signaling and are resistant to the cyto-toxic effects of glucocorticoids . Accordingly , we observed a significant negative correlation between Lck expression and overall cell killing in response to dexamethasone Figure 7g . Dasatinib enhances glucocorticoid sensitivity and apoptosis in primary CLL cells . In stark contrast to glucocorticoid-sensitive cells , Lck expression was not down-regulated by dexamethasone in CLL Figure 8a and b . In fact , Lck was modestly elevated by dexamethasone , which in turn , led to increased Lck phosphorylation at Y394 Figure 8b . However , when cells were simultaneously treated with 100 nM dasatinib , Lck phosphorylation was suppressed Figure 8b . This suggests that , by inhibiting Lck phosphorylation , dasatinib compensates for a high level of Lck in the presence of dexamethasone . To ensure that CLL cells responded to glucocorticoid-mediated changes in gene expression , we measured the level of an unrelated protein Txnip , which we previously reported to be upregu-lated by dexamethasone in WEHI7.2 cells and primary thymocytes by a GR-dependent mechanism.31 Txnip was also upregulated by dexamethasone in CLL cells within 3 h Figure 8c , suggesting that glucocorticoid resistance in CLL is not due to an aberration in cellular uptake of dexa-methasone or GR-mediated changes in gene transcription . Next , we assessed whether dasatinib would enhance sensitivity to dexamethasone in seven primary CLL samples as well as peripheral blood lymphocytes isolated from a patient with circulating mantle cell lymphoma leukemic form . We found that dasatinib significantly enhanced the response to dexamethasone at therapeutically relevant concentrations ranging from 10 7 to 10 5 M Figure 8d . By 72 h , dasatinib had increased the response to dexamethasone by greater than twofold and induced over 50 % cell killing Figure 8e . The effect on MEC1 cells was similar given that dasatinib also enhanced cell death by approximately twofold after 24 h of treatment with increasing concentrations of dexamethasone Figure 8f . Moreover , the combination of both agents more than tripled the amount of dead apoptotic that is , Annexin V and propidium iodide positive cells Figure 8g . To control for potentially nonspecific effects of dasatinib , we also treated CLL cells with a combination of dexamethasone and the Src inhibitor PP2 , as well as the phosphopeptide EGQY*EEIP , where the asterisk denotes a phosphorylated tyrosine residue Figure 8h and i . This peptide , derived from hamster polyoma middle T antigen , binds to Lck at a high affinity relative to other Src proteins.37,38 Because the SH2 domain of Lck is required for TCR signaling , 39,40 these peptides inhibit Lck by blocking SH2-mediated ligand inter-actions . PP2 and the Y*EEI peptide had some degree of activity as single agents , but both enhanced cell killing in response to dexamethasone Figure 8h and i . We also used the compound BIBF 1120 , which has approximately one order of magnitude higher selectivity for Lck than other Src family kinases.41 BIBF 50 nM produced similar results , further showing the importance for Lck inhibition Figure 8i . Thus , we conclude that inhibition of Lck significantly enhances sensi-tivity to dexamethasone in a model of lymphoid malignancy that is relatively insensitive to glucocorticoid treatment . Discussion Here , we report that Lck protects cells from glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis . In glucocorticoid-sensitive T cells , Lck was downregulated by dexamethasone to inhibit TCR activation and signaling . Because TCR activation antagonizes gluco-corticoid-induced apoptosis , 9�12 we reasoned that the inhibi-tion of Lck would confer sensitivity to dexamethasone . We found that inhibition of Lck by RNA interference RNAi or by the small-molecule inhibitor dasatinib enhanced glucocorti-coid-induced apoptosis in lymphoid cells , and particularly in primary CLL cells that were partially resistant to dexametha-sone . CLL represents a clinically relevant model of lymphoid malignancy because synthetic glucocorticoids , such as prednisone and dexamethasone , are widely used in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents for treating aggressive or refractory CLL . Previous studies have shown that glucocorticoids rapidly inhibit Lck by a nongenomic mechanism involving inter-actions between the ligand-bound GR and TCR signaling complex.22,23 In addition , it has been shown that dexametha-sone redistributes Lck out of lipid rafts after T-cell activation , thereby attenuating its activity.19 Although these studies unequivocally show that glucocorticoids inhibit Lck and other Src family kinases by distinct mechanisms , this is the first report providing evidence that Lck transcript and protein levels are downregulated by dexamethasone in a GR-dependent manner . This finding was initially discovered from microarray analysis of dexamethasone-treated cells . In primary thymo-cytes , Lck was among a subset of genes that were down-regulated by a signal Log2 ratio of 42.5 that is , greater than sixfold repression . In addition , we show that Lck expression was downregulated at the protein level in mouse lymphoma lines WEHI7.2 and S49A.2 , primary thymocytes , and the human T-ALL cell line CEMC7 , which is also sensitive to glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis.42 However , Lck transcript levels were not reported to be differentially expressed in primary ALL cells treated with prednisolone43 or after in vivo treatment with glucocorticoid-based monotherapy.44 Yet , a recent study by Mansha et al. , found that the Src-like adaptor protein SLAP , a negative regulator of TCR signaling with significant homology to Lck , 45 was upregulated by dexa-methasone exclusively in glucocorticoid-sensitive ALL cell lines.46 Thus , SLAP may be upregulated in B-or T-ALL to circumvent lymphocyte activation or Lck activity . Moreover , it is likely that the regulation of Lck in lymphocytic leukemias is heterogeneous . For example , in this report , we observed that Lck expression was not downregulated by dexametha-sone in CLL cells , but was modestly elevated . Of particular interest were other genes that were down-regulated by dexamethasone that are part of the TCR signal-ing pathway . First , CD3e and CD3g polypeptides were both downregulated in primary thymocytes . Although decreased expression of CD3 may contribute to glucocorticoid-mediated inhibition of TCR signaling , our RNAi experiments clearly show that the downregulation of Lck alone is sufficient to inhibit TCR-induced calcium oscillations . Second , MEK was downregulated by dexamethasone at the transcript level . Although we did not confirm whether glucocorticoids directly affect MEK levels , this result may provide an additional explanation for why dexamethasone and dasatinib have synergistic activity , given that dasatinib effectively inhibits MEK phosphorylation in T cells.33 Finally , we observed that multiple proteins that make up the TCR signaling pathway were downregulated by dexamethasone . In particular , Fyn and ZAP-70 levels were decreased 24 h after glucocorticoid treatment . Adaptor proteins LAT and SLP-76 were also downregulated by dexamethasone , although this effect was far more pronounced in the presence of dasatinib . These observations further support the concept that glucocorticoids strongly inhibit TCR signal transduction by negatively regulat-ing multiple components of the pathway . Our results suggest that the downregulation of Lck by dexamethasone does not directly mediate glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis in T cells . However , it is likely that the downregulation of Lck by dexamethasone contributes to cell death and apoptosis by blocking lymphocyte receptor signal-ing . Because it has been previously shown that MEK and ERK are both necessary and sufficient to inhibit glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis in immature T cells , 11 we anticipate that Lck inhibition results in the loss of MEK and ERK activation , thereby increasing glucocorticoid sensitivity . The direct influence of MEK and ERK activation on glucocorticoid sensitivity has been documented in other studies , 12,47 and supported in part by our result that MEK1 2 phosphorylation is virtually nondetectable in the presence of dexamethasone and dasatinib . Although dasatinib as a single agent had some cytotoxic effect in CLL cells , the degree of cell killing was variable between patient samples and was relatively modest at a concentration of 100 nM . A recent study showed that the IC50 of dasatinib in 18 CLL samples ranged from 0.78 to 53.3 mM.48 Although CLL cells are relatively insensitive to dasatinib alone , it is likely that Lck may contribute , in part , to their survival . For example , CLL cells are partially characterized by increased BCR signaling events , 35,36 including elevated levels of phosphotyrosine and cytosolic calcium , which are thought to facilitate cell survival.49,50 These events correlate with aberrant expression of Lck29 and constitutive expression of its B-cell homolog Lyn , 36 both of which regulate BCR activity . Moreover , our results suggest that other Lck inhibitors for example , PP2 , Y*EEI peptide , and BIBF 1120 also have some degree of cytotoxic activity and all three molecules synergize with dexamethasone . The peptide sequence EGQY*EEIP was specifically designed to bind the SH2 domain of Lck37,38 and derivatives of these peptides have previously been shown to inhibit cell proliferation in 293T cells.51 BIBF 1120 specifically implicates the involvement of Lck because it is B10-fold more selective for Lck than other Src kinases.41 The most profound cytotoxic responses in CLL cells were observed when dasatinib and dexamethasone were used in combination . Importantly , although glucocorticoids are commonly used to treat lymphoid malignancy , complete responses in CLL lag behind that of ALL and multiple myeloma.1,34,52,53 CLL cells were relatively insensitive to dexamethasone when treated ex vivo , and their degree of resistance was positively correlated with Lck expression . In addition , CLL cells were resistant to dexamethasone-mediated downregulation of Lck , which was not due to defects in glucocorticoid uptake or aberrations in the GR . Thus , even in the presence of dexamethasone , total and phosphorylated Lck were elevated . Thus , we argue that the high level of Lck in CLL contributes to glucocorticoid resistance in these cells , as Src kinase inhibitors sensitize them to dexamethasone . Collectively , our data indicate that Lck functions to anta-gonize glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis . Because inhibition of Lck sensitizes cells to the cytotoxic effects of dexametha-sone , small-molecule inhibitors of Lck should be considered for treating glucocorticoid-resistant malignancies .

20379195	The breast epithelium consists of two cell compartments , luminal and basal . Luminal cells are connected by tight junctions and form a single layer of polarized epithelium around the ductal lumen . They express cytokeratin CK 18 and high levels of heat-stable surface antigen CD24.1�2 About a third of the luminal epithelial cells express the nuclear hormone receptors , estrogen receptor-a ERa and proges-terone receptor , 3 and act as sensor cells by detecting steroid hormones and translating this systemic stimulus into local autocrine paracrine signals.4 The basal compartment comprises all the cells that do not touch the lumen , these include progenitors and myoepithelial cells.2 The latter are contractile , form a meshwork around the luminal cells , and have a role in milk ejection during lactation . Basal cells express CK14 and have extensive contact with the basal lamina , dependent on high expression of the adhesion molecules integrin b4 ITGB4 and a6 ITGA6 .5�6 Human basal and luminal cells can be separated based on differential expression of the surface antigen CD10 1 their murine counterparts can be distinguished by their CD24 immuno phenotype , with basal cells expressing low CD24lo and luminal cells expressing high levels CD24hi .2 Fluorescence-activated cell sorting FACS experiments with mouse mammary epithelial cells MMECs have shown NE , USA that CD24lo populations with high expression of ITGB1 CD29hi or ITGA6 CD49fhi are enriched for cells with in vivo reconstitution potential.7�8 It is thought that mammary stem cells of CD24loCD29hi CD49fhi phenotype , give rise , either directly or through intermediary cell stages , to bipotent progenitors . These in turn generate basal myoepithelial and luminal progenitors that differentiate into mature myoepithelial cells and different types of luminal cells that can be alveolar or ductal and ERa positive or negative.9 Recently , Notch signaling has been implicated in controlling stem cells and lineage commitment in different ways.10�12 Binding of ligands , Jagged1 and 2 , and Dll1 , 3 , and 4 expressed on the surface of neighboring cells leads to cleavage of Notch receptors 1�4 and release of the Notch intracellular domain , which converts the DNA-binding protein CBF1 Rbp-Jk from a repressor to an activator of transcrip-tion.13 On the one hand , Notch activation promoted self-renewal of stem cells , proliferation of progenitor cells , and commitment to the myoepithelial lineage in human breast epithelial cells HBECs , as assessed by the mammosphere assay.11 On the other hand , cell separation experiments combined with colony-forming assays suggested that Notch signaling restricts bipotential human progenitors to a luminal cell fate10 and downmodulation of Rbp-Jk in mouse progenitor cells increased their reconstitution potential.12 Notch signaling has long been established as oncogenic in the mammary epithelium as a mouse mammary tumor virus MMTV insertion resulting in a truncated , constitutively active Notch4 caused mammary tumors at high frequency.14 It has also been implicated in human breast carcinogenesis , with expression of its inhibitor Numb being lost in 50 % of mammary carcinomas.15 Increased expression of Jagged-1 has been associated with a bad prognosis.16 Whether the dual role of Notch , alternatively oncogenic or differentiation inducing , depends on cellular context , developmental stage , hormonal milieu , and or different receptors with Notch1 and 3 implicated in differentiation10 and Notch4 controlling stem cells10�11 remains to be addressed . Indeed , little is known about the downstream mechanisms involved in Notch function in the breast . p63 , similar to its homologs p53 and p73 , is a sequence-specific DNA-binding protein.17 Expression from different promoters produces two protein isoforms , TAp63 or DNp63 , which either contain or lack the N-terminal transacti-vation domain . Each isoform has three different C-terminal variants due to differential mRNA splicing a , b , and g .17 Mutations in p63 are implicated in a broad spectrum of human syndromes with deficiencies in epithelial homeostasis.18 Among them is the limb�mammary syndrome , involving hypoplasia aplasia of the mammary gland and nipple , in which mutations in exons 13 and 14 lead to a frameshift mutation resulting in a truncated protein.18 Deletion of p63 in the mouse germ line severely impairs skin development and blocks the formation of mammary glands and other ectodermal derivatives.19�22 This circumstance prevented the analysis of p63 function in the mammary gland . p63 is expressed in the basal compartment of many epithelia17,20,22 including the breast.23 It has been implicated in maintaining the proliferation potential of stem cells in the epidermis21 through the DNp63 isoform , whereas TAp63 is required in maintaining integrity of the female germ line.24 The molecular mechanisms underlying p63 function involve changes in transcription of cell adhesion genes including different integrins.25 Here , we examine p63 function in primary HBECs from multiple donors of different genetic backgrounds , and show that DNp63 is essential for the maintenance of basal cell fate and is negatively regulated by Notch signaling . We provide evidence that this antagonism operates in vivo during pubertal ductal morphogenesis in the mouse mammary gland . Results DNp63 function in maintaining basal versus luminal cell fates . To assess the role of p63 expression in basal breast epithelial cells , we performed loss-and gain-of-function experiments with primary HBECs . We purified luminal and basal cell populations from reduction mammoplasties using magnetic beads and an antibody recognizing CD10 1 cell separation was validated by assessing marker gene expres-sion Supplementary Figure 1a . As reported by O�Hare et al. , 26 the two populations had distinct phenotypes CD10 ? basal HBECs proliferated faster than CD10 luminal cultures and propagated over eight passages . CD10 ? cells were refractile and tended to scatter Supple-mentary Figure 1b . CD10 HBECs formed sheets with indistinct cell boundaries Supplementary Figure 1b and grew only up to 2�4 passages . Both cultures remained homogeneous over time and continued to express respective markers Supplementary Figure 1c . Having ascertained that DNp63a is the predominant p63 isoform expressed in HBECs Supplementary Figure 2a�d , we downmodulated DNp63 expression in CD10 ? cells by shRNA-mediated knockdown Supplementary Figure 2c and d . DNp63 shRNA-expressing cultures grew less dense Figure 1a and increased less in cell numbers Figure 1b than control-infected populations . Consistent with DNp63 downmodulation resulting in decreased proliferation , bromo-deoxyuridine BrdU was incorporated by 34.1 and 35.7 % of the control-infected cells and only by 4.9 and 7.8 % of DNp63 shRNA-expressing cells Figure 1c . Transcript levels of basal markers such as CK14 and ITGA6 decreased Figure 1d , whereas those of the luminal markers , CD24 and CK18 , increased on DNp63 depletion Figure 1e . Similarly , ITGA6 , ITGB4 , and CK14 decreased Figure 1d and CK18 Figure 1e increased at the protein level . These results suggested that DNp63 expression is required to maintain the basal versus the luminal phenotype in HBECs . To address whether DNp63 is sufficient to induce a basal conversion , we ectopically expressed DNp63 in CD10 luminal cells . Western blotting revealed that ectopically expressed p63 in CD10 HBECs reached levels compar-able with those of endogenous p63 in CD10 ? cells 3 days after infection Figure 2a . As expected , control-infected luminal cell populations grew slowly as islands Figure 2b and had indistinct cell borders Figure 2d . By contrast , in DNp63-expressing populations , cells became refractile and scattered similar to basal cells Figure 2c and e .26 Cell numbers increased by about fourfold at 9 days and by 40-fold at 23 days after infection over their respective controls Figure 2f . The percentage of cells in S phase increased , with 26.7 % of GFP-DNp63-versus 16.6 % of GFP-only-expressing cells incorporating BrdU Figure 2g . The morpho-logical changes were accompanied at the molecular level by increased CK14 and ITGA6 and decreased CK18 and CD24 mRNA expression Figure 2h . At the protein level , ITGA6 and CK14 were increased and CK18 decreased in cultures expressing DNp63 Figure 2i . Thus , expression of DNp63 is sufficient to induce several hallmarks of the basal phenotype in CD10 -sorted HBECs . The role of Notch in driving luminal cell fate depends on negative regulation of DNp63 . Our findings suggested that DNp63 is an essential control element in the maintenance of basal versus luminal cell fates . Notch3 and Notch1 have recently been implicated in driving luminal cell fate.10,12 In keratinocytes , Notch1 signaling promotes differentiation and negatively regulates p63 expression , 27,28 making Notch signaling an attractive pathway upstream of DNp63 to investigate . To test whether Notch drives luminal cell commitment by downmodulating DNp63 , we expressed the intracellular domain of Notch1 NICD in primary HBECs . Within 48 h of infection , DNp63 transcript was significantly decreased Figure 3a and DNp63 protein was consistently reduced Figure 3b . NICD-expressing HBECs aggregated and could not be passaged . To assess the effects of Notch activation on cell proliferation , we expressed NICD under the control of phosphoglycerate kinase PGK promoter . This approach yielded lower NICD expression levels and less Notch signaling activation , as assessed by target gene expression Supplementary Figure 3a , and allowed us to passage the NICD-expressing HBECs . Cell density was reduced by both high and low NICD expression Figure 3c . Increase in cell number assessed in low NICD-expressing HBECs was reduced Figure 3d . Consistent with this being due to decreased proliferation , BrdU incorporation Figure 3e and Ki67 labeling Figure 3f were lower among cells expressing NICD and GFP than GFP-only-expressing cells . Furthermore , increased Notch activity resulted in significant downmodulation of integrins enriched in basal cells , such as ITGB1 , ITGB4 , and ITGA6 Figure 3g and h , similar to what was observed in MCF10A cells depleted for DNp63.25 As we failed to detect increased expression of the luminal marker CK18 in HBECs with constitutive Notch activation , we expressed a NICD fused to a mutant ERa that can be transiently activated by exposure to 4-OH - tamoxifen.29 Treatment of HBECs expressing this construct with 4-OH-tamoxifen for 8 h resulted in increased Notch signaling activity , as assessed by increased mRNA expres-sion of Hey-1 Supplementary Figure 3b and increased CK18 mRNA expression by 3.4-fold over 14 days Figure 3i . Thus , activation of Notch signaling not only downmodulates DNp63 expression but also has effects on cell proliferation and marker gene expression similar to those caused by DNp63 depletion . To address the functional significance of DNp63 down-modulation in the context of increased Notch signaling , we coinfected unsorted HBECs with NICD and DNp63-expres-sing retroviruses . As expected , in NICD-expressing cultures , cells aggregated and cell density was reduced compared with control cultures Figure 4a and b , left versus middle panels . In the cultures coexpressing NICD and DNp63 , cell density was comparable with control populations Figure 4a and b , right panels . Increased DNp63 expression also counteracted Notch-induced downmodulation of ITGB1 , ITGB4 , and ITGA6 at the mRNA level Figure 4c . At the protein level , Notch-induced downmodulation of ITGB4 was counteracted by ectopic DNp63 expression Figure 4d . Thus , DNp63 down-modulation is required for , at least , some of the effects of Notch in HBECs . DNp63 Notch signaling in vivo . Our findings indicated that persistent expression of DNp63 is required to maintain basal cell fate in HBECs by counteracting the role of Notch in driving and or maintaining luminal cell fate . Such an antagonism between Notch signaling and p63 expression had been suggested to be of importance to maintain luminal cells , specifically during pregnancy , in the mouse mammary gland.30 To assess when and where canonical Notch signaling is active during mammary gland development , we used a transgenic Notch reporter TNR mouse strain , which includes an EGFP gene downstream of CBF1 RBP-Jk-responsive element four CBF1-binding sites and the basal simian virus 40 promoter . GFP expression was shown to faithfully reflect CBF1 activity.31 By fluorescent stereo-microscopy , GFP was first detected in mammary glands at 3 weeks of age , at the onset of puberty the signal peaked between 4 and 6 weeks , it was weak at 12 weeks , and undetectable thereafter Figure 5a . Thus , canonical Notch activity , as detected by this approach , was specific to pubertal ductal morphogenesis . At this stage of mammary gland development , extensive cell proliferation occurs at the tips of the ducts , which enlarge to become terminal end buds TEBs .32 TEBs comprise an outer layer of cap cells , enriched in stem and myoepithelial progenitor cells and inner body cells considered as luminal precursor cells.32,33 Consistent with an involvement of Notch signaling in cell fate determination , the GFP signal was strongest at TEBs and decreased proximally along the subtending ducts Figure 5b�d . Coimmunostaining for GFP and p63 revealed that expression of the two was mutually exclusive p63 was expressed in cap or myoepithelial cells , whereas GFP expression was detected in body cells Figure 5e , left panel and luminal cells of the subtending duct Figure 5e , right panel . According to our model , Notch signaling is initially activated in basal progenitor cells , in which it leads to downmodulation of p63 expression and triggers luminal differentiation . Hence , a subpopulation of CD24 lo cells was expected to have active Notch signaling and decreased expression levels of p63 . Low GFP expression and subtle differences in p63 expression might not be discerned by immunohistochemical approach used in the previous experiment . Hence , we FACS-sorted MMECs from 4 to 5-week-old reporter mice on the basis of GFP and CD24 expression after exclusion of stromal cells . Both CD24 lo and CD24 hi populations comprised of GFP-positive cells Figure 5f . Consistent with the immuno-fluorescence results , CD24 hi cells expressed higher levels of GFP both at the protein Figure 5f and mRNA levels Figure 5g than CD24 lo cell populations . Furthermore , gene expression analysis showed that ITGB1 and ITGA6 were enriched in CD24 lo versus CD24 hi cells and that p63 itself was expressed at about 170-fold higher levels in CD24 lo than in CD24 hi MMECs Figure 5g , validating the cell separation procedure . Strikingly , among the CD24 lo cells , the GFP-positive population showed consistently reduced p63 mRNA expression Figure 5g . Thus , in CD24 lo MMECs , in which Notch signaling is or has been active , p63 mRNA expression levels are decreased , consistent with Notch activation , decreasing p63 expression in progenitor cells in vivo . Requirement of DNp63 downmodulation and activation of Notch signaling in vivo . To address whether down-modulation of DNp63 is required to establish luminal cells in vivo , we resorted to mammary gland reconstitution experi-ments . Briefly , in 3-week-old mice , the inguinal mammary glands can be cleared of endogenous epithelium by surgically removing the nipple-near half that contains the rudimentary ductal system . The MMECs that are injected into the remaining �cleared� fat pad will give rise to a new ductal system.34 Primary MMECs infected with either GFP-DNp63 or a GFP control virus , were injected into contra lateral-cleared mammary fat pads . After 3 months , MMECs infected with GFP virus gave rise to ductal systems with widespread GFP expression Figure 6a , b , and d , whereas GFP-DNp63 virus-infected MMECs reconstituted less overall Figure 6a and had spotty GFP expression Figure 6c and e . To determine the specific cell fate of the infected cells , we performed immunohistochemistry for the myoepithelial cell marker , smooth muscle actin SMA . Coimmunostaining revealed that GFP control MMECs were present in both cell compartments with 66 % being SMA and being 34 % SMA ? Figure 6f and g . Among the DNp63-GFP-infected cells , only 14 % were SMA but 86 % were SMA ? Figure 6h and i . Thus , constitutive DNp63 expression impairs overall reconstitution and specifically inhibits luminal cell fate , indicating that downmodulation of DNp63 is required to establish and or maintain luminal cell lineage in vivo . To address whether Notch activation is functionally important for the control of DNp63 expression in vivo , we deleted both alleles of the central Notch mediator CBF1 RBP-Jk in the mammary epithelium . Mice in which both alleles of RBP-Jk were flanked by loxP sites Rbpsuhfl fl were crossed with MMTV-Cre transgenic mice.30 Analysis of mammary glands from 5-week-old mice by whole mount microscopy revealed no obvious difference Figure 7a and b , which is consistent with previous work.30 However , as the MMTV-LTR is only active in a subset of MMECs , it was conceivable that CBF1 RBP-Jk-deficient MMECs were outgrown by unde-leted , wild-type WT MMECs . To address this concern , we crossed the mice with a Cre reporter strain designated Z EG LacZ EGFP , 35 in which Cre excision activates expression of EGFP . Mammary epithelium of MMTV-Cre.Z EG double transgenic mice , with one WT allele of RBP-Jk , showed a strong GFP signal Figure 7d and f . Immunostaining revealed that about 20 % of the MMECs express GFP Figure 7h and l . In contrast , in MMTV-Cre.Z EG double transgenic mice homozygous for the conditional RBP-Jk allele , GFP signal was scarce Figure 7c and e and few GFP-expressing cells were detected by immunostaining Figure 7g and k , indicating that RBP-Jk-deficient cells were negatively selected . Inter-estingly , coimmunostaining for GFP and p63 revealed that in RBPfl WT double transgenic epithelia , GFP ? cells were present in both p63 ? and p63 compartments Figure 7h , j and l , whereas in RBPfl fl double transgenic epithelia all the GFP ? RBP-Jk-deficient MECs expressed p63 Figure 7g , i and k and SMA Supplementary Figure 4 . This indicates that RBP-Jk-deficient cells were unable to down-modulate p63 expression and did not contribute to the luminal layer . Thus , both activation of canonical Notch signaling and downmodulation of DNp63 are required to establish and or maintain luminal cells in vivo . In the present paper , we provide , to our knowledge , the first evidence for a role of DNp63 in controlling cell fate in the breast epithelium , both in primary HBECs in vitro and in the mouse mammary gland in vivo . We show that DNp63 is a determinant of basal myoepithelial cell type under negative Notch control . Our results regarding the Notch function in this context are in line with studies that implicated Notch signaling in restricting bipotential progenitors to a luminal cell fate.10,12 They extend them by providing evidence for a functional requirement of canonical Notch signaling in establishing the luminal cell lineage in vivo and identifying suppression of DNp63 expression as an important underlying mechanism . Our findings are consistent with a model for the establish-ment of breast epithelial cell fates through antagonistic interaction of DNp63 and Notch Figure 8 . The striking global changes observed with cultured HBECs suggest that myoe-pithelial and luminal cells are interconvertible , controlled by the relative balance of DNp63 and Notch expression and activity Figure 8 , dashed arrows . Alternatively , they may reflect increased plasticity of HBECs in vitro36 with a large population of DNp63 ? progenitor-like cells37 that would be the prime target for DNp63 Notch interplay leading to differentiation along specific lineage Figure 8 , full arrows . In either scenario , activation of Notch signaling triggers a transition to luminal progenitors by downmodulating DNp63 expression and associated decrease of basal markers . Increase in Notch signaling activity in luminal progenitor stage I cells results in luminal progenitor stage II cells with a CD24hi phenotype and complete loss of DNp63 expression . As luminal progenitor stage II cells differentiate into mature luminal cells , Notch signaling is , however , reduced , as suggested by our analysis of the TNR reporter mouse with loss of GFP signal in the cells of the mature ducts . This interpretation is in line with the model of transient Notch activation driving luminal cell fate proposed by Raouf et al.10 Thus , in accordance with the proposed hierarchical transition from bipotential progenitors , with concomitant reduction to either luminal or myoepithelial progenitor cells , 9 our data reveal that activation of Notch signaling in bipotential progenitors with concomitant reduction in p63 expression and activity Figure 8 , full arrow can specify a luminal progenitor cell fate characterized by decreased DNp63 , ITGA6 , and ITGB1 expression , whereas the persistent DNp63 expression and attendant low Notch activity is required to maintain the multi-potential progenitor state and or to favor myoepithelial differentiation . In a broader context , we note that during pubertal ductal elongation , proliferation and cell fate determination occur specifically at the growing tips of the ducts , whereas at other stages , in particular pregnancy , proliferation is spread all over the ductal system . Previous studies of the RBPfl fl.MMTV-Cre mouse model showed that mammary glands looked normal until mid-pregnancy , suggesting that Notch function is not important in puberty.30 However , our finding that Notch signaling activity in vivo is specifically increased during pubertal ductal morphogenesis points to the possible importance of this pathway also at this stage , while it could still be active at lower levels at other stages . In fact , using the same mouse model as those in the previous studies , but adding a GFP reporter to visualize RBP-jk deletion , we found that in the apparently normal mammary glands before preg-nancy , cells with intact Notch signaling had been selected . Few RBP-jk-deficient cells , which are GFP positive , were found and these were limited to the basal compartment . This suggests that the appearance of an overt phenotype in RBPfl fl.MMTV-Cre females only during pregnancy30 is more likely a consequence of the increased and more widespread expres-sion of Cre under MMTV control at this time than an essential function of Notch RBP-jk limited to pregnancy . Consistent with this conclusion is the finding that expression of a dominant-negative Xenopus suppressor of hairless RBP-jk homolog gene impaired both pubertal ductal outgrowth and alveologenesis during pregnancy.38 The parallels of our findings in HBECs from multiple donors and in mouse point to a central and conserved antagonistic role of Notch and DNp63 in breast epithelial homeostasis . With Notch signaling implicated in breast carcinogenesis , 15�16 the question arises whether deregulation of this antagonism has a role in tumorigenesis . The Notch pathway has been targeted and g-secretase inhibitors are currently in clinical trials . Will they affect cell type specification in tumors and or the normal breast epithelium in treated patients ? Materials and Methods Primary cell culture and viral infection .

The putative stem cell gives rise to a bipotential progenitor cell that can take a myoepithelial or luminal cell fate .

As a result , a CD24lo cell with decreased p63 expression forms and the luminal progenitor stage I cell is determined . Continued and incremental Notch activation results in a luminal progenitor stage II cell , characterized by a CD24hi phenotype and lack of DNp63 . This cell in turn gives rise to various differentiated luminal cells that have no detectable Notch activity .

20489730	The transcription factor Sox2 self-renewal www.nature.com cdd is required for osteoblast The development and maintenance of all tissues and organs are orchestrated by a complex interplay of signaling mole-cules and transcription factors , whose expression governs cell fate determination , proliferation , and differentiation . Signaling by the fibroblast growth factor FGF family of growth factors and cognate receptors has an important function in skeletal development by affecting the proliferation and differentiation of chondrocytes and osteoblasts , the two major cell types responsible for bone formation . Several human skeletal disorders are caused by activating mutations in FGF receptors FGFR .1�3 In the osteoblastic lineage , FGF stimulates the proliferation of immature cells and inhibits their differentiation.4�7 By studying the mechanisms underlying the FGF response of osteoblasts , we found that FGF signaling antagonizes Wnt-induced transcription , a process , which promotes osteoblast differentiation and function.8,9 In these cells , treatment with exogenous FGF or the presence of activated FGFR2 strongly induces the expression of the transcription factor Sox2 . Sox2 contributes to the inhibition of Wnt signaling by FGF by binding to b-catenin , and its over-expression can by itself inhibit osteoblast differentiation.8,9 The transcription factor Sox2 is a member of the SRY-related , HMG box family , that has a critical function in embryonic development and in maintaining the pluripotency and self-renewal of embryonic stem ES cells.10�12 It was originally identified as a binding partner of the transcription factor Oct-4 in ES and embryonal carcinoma cells , in which it is crucial for the expression of FGF-4,13 and was later shown to regulate the expression of many other ES cell-specific genes . It has also been recently shown to be a critical factor for the reprogramming of somatic cells into �induced� pluripotent stem cells.14 Our knowledge about the origins , fate , and life span of cells along the osteoblast lineage is limited . Primitive osteo-progenitors arise from multipotent mesenchymal stem cells that commit and then differentiate to preosteoblasts and mature osteoblasts . Although the transcription factors Runx2 and Osterix OSX have been shown to be essential for commitment to the osteoblastic lineage , few factors that have a defined function in early osteoblast lineage expansion have been identified.15�19 To elucidate the function of Sox2 in osteogenesis and in osteoblasts self-renewal and differentiation , we have gener-ated a conditional Cre-mediated knockout of Sox2 in the osteoblast lineage . These mice are highly mosaic for Sox2 inactivation , but are smaller and show decreased trabecular bone density compared with their wild-type littermates . By culturing calvarial osteoblasts from these mutant mice , we were unable to recover any viable Sox2-null cells . Excision of the Sox2 gene in primary or immortalized osteoblasts in culture produced Sox2-null cells that did not survive passa-ging in culture , could not form colonies , and arrested their growth with a senescent phenotype . These and other results identify an earlier unknown function for this transcription factor in maintaining self-renewal of the osteoblastic lineage and suggest that Sox2 expression is required to maintain osteoprogenitor cells in a multi-or unipotent stem-like proliferative state . Results and Discussion Generation of SOX2 conditional knockout mice . As the Sox2 KO is lethal in early embryonic development , 10 to precisely define the function of Sox2 in osteoblast proliferation and differentiation , we created a conditional knockout CKO of the Sox2 gene in the osteoblastic lineage using mice with a Sox2flox geo genotype hereafter referred to as Sox2flox . In these mice , one of the two Sox2 alleles , is bracketed by loxP sequences , providing a target for the Cre-recombinase , whereas the other is replaced by the b-gal geo gene that inactivates the Sox2 gene Figure 1a .20 These mice , which are phenotypically normal , were crossed with transgenic mice expressing the Cre-recombinase under the control of the 2.3 kb collagen I promoter , which is specifically expressed in the osteoblastic lineage , to elicit Sox2 excision in Cre-bearing Sox2-floxed F2 offspring Figure 1b .21 The resulting Sox2 CKO mice were initially difficult to study because they died at birth with esophageal atresia , most likely because of aberrant expression of the Cre-recombinase in the esophagus and trachea and the essential function of Sox2 in the development of the foregut.22 However , this phenotype has low penetrance , and at least 50 % of the pups survive to adulthood . These mice are smaller than their wild-type littermates and are mostly sterile Figure 1c . Micro-CT analysis reveals that mutant mice have reduced bone density with defects in trabecular bone . Bone mineral density and bone volume are reduced , whereas trabecular pattern factor , a parameter of micro-CT analysis that is increased in poor quality bone , 23 is higher in the Sox2 CKO mice Figure 1d�g . Cortical bone thickness is also reduced as is the density of parietal bones in the skull not shown . Interestingly , these effects are clearly detected even though these mice are highly mosaic for Sox2 inactivation . At birth , 450 % of the calvarial osteoblasts seem to have maintained the Sox2 gene . Although in principle this could be due to inefficient expression or activity of the Cre-recombinase , this seemed unlikely , as , if anything , the collagen I Cre mice seem to express Cre more uniformly and less tissue specifically than expected . This finding suggested that Sox2-expressing cells have a growth advantage over Sox2-null osteoblasts , a notion supported by the experiments described below . Sox2 inactivation impairs osteoblast proliferation . To analyze the phenotype of Sox2-null osteoblasts , we generated cultures of calvarial osteoblasts from the mutant mice . PCR analysis of DNA from freshly cultured cells showed that deletion of the floxed Sox2 allele had occurred . However , after culturing osteoblast pools from the P1 calvaria of the mutant Sox2flox Cre mice for 3�4 passages , the deleted Sox2 allele could no longer be detected by PCR analysis , whereas it was maintained in cultures from Sox2flox ? Cre mice , which carry a wild-type Sox2 allele that can not be excised by the Cre-recombinase , suggesting that Sox2 deletion is incompatible with osteoblast survival Figure 2a . To directly determine whether Sox2 inactivation was deleterious to cell survival , we infected freshly cultured primary Sox2flox osteoblast populations with a Cre-expressing adenovirus also expressing GFP linked to Cre by an IRES to induce Sox2 excision . We could show that Sox2 excision had taken place in a majority of the cells by PCR analysis , but again , after 2�3 passages in culture Sox2-negative cells could no longer be detected Figure 2b . To better quantitate these experiments , we performed colony assays . We infected independent cultures of primary osteoblasts derived from Sox2flox mice with the Cre-expressing adenovirus and the corresponding control adenovirus expressing only GFP . Although cells infected in the GFP-virus yielded a very similar number of colonies , Cre-virus infection drastically reduced the colony-forming ability of these cultures . In contrast , cultures of primary osteoblasts from Sox2flox ? mice were completely resistant to the effect of Cre-virus infection Figure 2c . Together , these results strongly suggested that Sox2 inactivation abolished the ability of osteoblasts to sustain proliferation in culture . To facilitate biochemical and genetic experiments that are difficult to perform in primary cultures that have a limited life span , we created several clonal lines of Sox2flox osteoblasts by immortalizing them with polyoma large T antigen PyLT . PyLT inactivates the Rb proteins , but not p53 . As earlier reported , PyLT immortalized osteoblasts are still capable of differentiating into mature osteoblasts in culture , although this process is slightly slower than in primary osteoblasts.6 Several independent clones of immortalized Sox2flox cells were infected with a Cre-expressing retrovirus that also carries the GFP gene . Infection of such cell lines leads to deletion of Sox2 gene and reduction in Sox2 protein level Figure 3a and c . As observed in primary osteoblasts , however , subsequent passaging of the Cre-virus-infected cells led to disappearance of the deleted floxed allele , indicating that cells in which Sox2 excision had occurred were incapable of survival in culture . We , therefore , performed a colony assay in which either GFP-or Cre-GFP-infected cells were plated and the number of colonies formed determined after 7 days . As shown in Figure 3b , the number of colonies obtained was drastically reduced 70�90 % in Cre-infected cells with respect to those produced by a control retroviral infection no Cre , and all surviving clones were GFP negative , representing cells that escaped retrovirus infection . Infection of wild-type or Sox2flox ? osteoblasts with the Cre-virus had no deleterious effect . Several groups have reported that Cre expression can cause non-specific DNA-damage effects in cell culture.24 Despite the lack of any effects of the Cre-recombinase in wild-type and Sox2flox ? osteoblasts , we wanted to rule out the possibility that the observed cell lethality after Cre-virus expression might be due to the toxic effects of Cre . We thus isolated mouse embryonic fibroblasts MEFs from mouse embryos and infected them with the same Cre and GFP retroviruses . Infection of Sox2flox fibroblasts , which do not express Sox2 , produced excision of the Sox2 gene , but Sox2-null fibroblasts could be easily maintained in culture Supple-mentary Figure 1b . To conclusively show that the decrease in colony formation induced by Cre-mediated excision in Sox2flox osteoblasts was due only to Sox2 inactivation , we introduced into several clones of immortalized Sox2flox or Sox2flox flox cells a �transgenic� copy of the Sox2 gene using lentivirus-mediated transduction Figure 3c . Infection with the Cre-virus led to excision of the endogenous Sox2 gene , but no significant inhibition of colony formation was observed , showing that constitutive expression of Sox2 abolishes the detrimental effects of the inactivation of the endogenous Sox2 gene Figure 3d . These experiments , therefore , show that the inability of Sox2-floxed osteoblasts to proliferate after Cre-virus infection is due to the lack of Sox2 expression and not to Cre-mediated cell damage . Inactivation of Sox 2 in cultured osteoblasts causes a senescent-like growth arrest . Examination of Sox2 - depleted cell populations 6�7 days after infection showed extensive morphological changes with the appearance of large cells with a �flat , � senescent-like morphology , and substantial inhibition of proliferation. Figure 4a . DNA synthesis was greatly decreased by 48 h after Cre-virus infection Figure 4b , but no evidence of increased apoptosis , as measured by TUNEL assay or caspase activation , was observed . As expected , Sox2-transduced cells experienced no reduction in DNA synthesis . As Sox2 overexpression inhibits differentiation in immortalized osteoblasts8 as well as in primary cells Supplementary Figure 2 , we tested the expression of several markers of osteoblast differentiation , including alkaline phosphatase ALP , Runx2 , and OSX expression.17 We did not observe any increased expression of ALP by 7 days after Cre-infection , and only a minor increase in the expression of Runx2 and OSX RNAs . Instead , we noticed a clear increase in the expression of cdk inhibitors p16 and p27 Figure 4c . Cdk inhibitors A threshold of Sox2 is necessary to maintain osteoblast survival . Although our findings with osteoblasts from Sox2 mutant mice highlighted the function of Sox2 in maintaining proliferation potential in osteoblasts , all of our experiments had been performed with osteoblasts from mutant mice carrying a floxed Sox2 allele , and it was of interest to be able to extend these observations to independent osteoblastic cell lines . Furthermore , we wished to rule out the effect of excision of any Sox2 flanking sequences such as those that may encode regulatory micro-RNAs . To address these questions , we used two immortalized osteoblast cell lines that our laboratory had earlier characterized OB1 , a PyLT immortalized immature osteoblast line , and OB5 , a spontaneously immortalized cell line derived from p53 ? calvaria.6,27 We also tested OB1-Apert cells , an OB1-derived expression is elevated in senescent cells , 25 and this together with the cell morphology of Cre-infected osteoblasts made us assay for the presence of senescence-associated b-galactosidase SABG that is considered to be a hallmark of senescence.26 Cre-infected osteoblasts stained positive for SABG , whereas Sox2-transduced cells did not , indicating that loss of Sox2 might produce a phenotype akin to senescence in osteoblasts Figure 4d . It is relevant to mention here that the endogenous b-gal from the Sox2-null allele is not expressed in these cells , probably because of the deletion of a B2 kb DNA region20 that seems to contain osteoblast-specific regulatory elements . clone carrying the activated FGFR2 bearing the S252W mutation found in Apert syndrome , that express high levels of Sox2 , at least 10-fold more than the parental OB1 cells.8 We infected these cell lines with pBabe-hygro retrovirus expressing three shRNAs directed against murine Sox2 , and a scrambled shRNA control and selected for hygromycin-resistant cell clones . These three shRNAs were found to differentially reduce Sox2 expression in the OB1-Apert cells Figure 5a , ranging from 60 to 90 % inhibition of Sox2 protein expression . As seen in Figure 5b , infection of OB1 or OB5 cells with Sox2 shRNA vectors completely abrogated colony formation . On the other hand , OB1-Apert cells were still capable of forming colonies , with an efficiency ranging between 25 and 85 % of the colonies produced by the cells expressing the scrambled control shRNA Figure 5b . The differential ability of the shRNAs to inhibit Sox2 protein expression was reflected in the ability to form colonies , as the shRNA 1043 that caused the least reduction in Sox2 levels produced the highest number of colonies . The OB1-Apert cells expressing Sox2 shRNA 900 and 998 that could form colonies grew considerably more slowly than the parental cells Figure 5c , whereas the growth of cells expressing shRNA 1043 was not affected , as expected . The proliferation of NIH3T3 mouse fibroblasts , that do not express Sox2 , was unaffected by Sox2 shRNAs as infection with all Sox2-specific shRNA viruses resulted in a number of hygromycin-resistant colonies essentially identical to that produced by the scrambled shRNA control not shown . These results show Sphere-forming osteoblasts are enriched for Sox2 expression . The results presented so far show that Sox2 is essential for osteoblast self-renewal and suggest that its expression may mark a population of uncommitted or unipotent osteoblasts . To investigate this hypothesis , we have used a technique that has been successful in identifying such stem-like cells in the nervous system , mammary gland , skin , and tumor tissues , that is the ability of these cells to form �spheres� of unattached cells in suspension culture . Indeed , a recent report has shown that calvarial osteoblasts are capable of forming �osteospheres� in suspension , representing progenitor multipotent cell populations.28 In line with this observation , we found that osteoblasts isolated from calvaria of P1 pups are capable of forming osteospheres . We found that Sox2 expression is greatly enriched in the osteosphere fractions as compared with the total adherent cell population Figure 6a . On the other hand , the expression of OSX , Runx2 , and Collagen1-a1 , markers of committed osteoblasts , was down-regulated in the spheres , confirming that they indeed represent a precursor cell population Figure 6b�d . Treatment with FGF , that induces Sox2 expression , increased osteosphere formation by primary osteoblasts 5�6-fold Figure 6e . As expected , we also found that osteoblasts made from calvaria of Sox2flox Cre mice , that are a mosaic of Sox2 positive and Sox2-null cells , show reduced osteosphere-forming ability as compared with the osteoblasts isolated from control littermate mice , indicating that Sox2 is necessary to maintain a pool of osteoprogenitor cells Figure 6f . Together , these results support the notion that , while Sox2 expression is necessary for the survival of the entire osteoblast population , high levels of Sox2 correlate with the ability to form osteospheres , and mark a subpopulation of immature , progenitor cells . In this report , we describe the novel finding that the transcription factor Sox2 has an essential function in the expansion of the osteoblastic lineage . Progenitor stem-like cells are responsible for the development and maintenance of most tissues and organs . Osteoblast populations in culture represent a mixture of osteoprogenitor cells and immature osteoblasts , and proliferation in culture selects for more immature multi-or unipotent stem-like cells.28,29 Our data show quite clearly that inhibition of Sox2 expression , whether by excision of the endogenous Sox2 gene or by RNA interference , abolishes the ability of both primary and immortalized osteoblasts to proliferate . These conclusions are also supported by the observation that mice we have generated with a CKO of Sox2 in the osteoblastic lineage have reduced bone density , in spite of being highly mosaic for Sox2 inactivation . Although a full description of the phenotype of these mice is beyond the scope of this report , clearly this phenotype is less severe that what could have been expected from the behavior of Sox2-null osteoblasts in culture . A likely reason for this is that only B50 % of the osteoblasts in the skull and presumably also in other bones have lost the Sox2 gene , probably because the collagen I promoter-driven Cre used in these experiments is expressed rather late during osteoblastic lineage development , 21,30,31 or is inefficient , allowing cells escaping Cre-mediated Sox2 excision to proliferate at the expense of Sox2-null cells . Another possible explanation is that Sox2�s function could be redundant with that of other Sox factors in vivo , such as Sox4 , whose inactivation has been also shown to impair bone develop-ment.32 However , such redundancy does not seem to occur in cell cultures , and would not account for the mosaicism of the Sox2 CKO mice . The results presented here strengthen the notion that Sox2 expression is required for the maintenance of a stem cell progenitor-like state in several tissues . Indeed , a similar requirement for Sox2 expression has been reported for neural and retinal progenitor cells.20,33,34 Our results also show that Sox2 inactivation causes growth arrest by inducing a senescent-like phenotype . Runx2-deficient osteoblasts have been reported to bypass senescense , 35 but we found that the level of Runx2 in Sox2-null cells is not appreciably altered . Sox2-null cells do not seem to be in a terminally differentiated osteocyte-like state as DMP1 , a marker of osteocytes is not expressed in Sox2-null cells data not shown . This suggests that Sox2 inactivation targets specific osteoblast genes that may be important for their proliferation . Although we have shown that Sox2 can interfere with Wnt b-catenin signaling by binding to b-catenin , such an effect requires relatively high levels of Sox2 such as those induced by FGF , 8,9 whereas the basal levels of Sox2 expression in osteoblasts are quite low . We , therefore , do not think the main function of Sox2 in the osteoblast lineage is , in the absence of exogenous Wnt stimulation , that of inhibiting Wnt signaling . Rather , we interpret the ability of Sox2 overexpression to inhibit differ-entiation as reflecting its function in maintaining osteoblasts in an immature , unipotent state . This is further supported by our observation that Sox2 expresssion is higher in osteosphere-forming cells as well as by the finding that Sox2 expression is enhanced in osteogenic cells in which differentiation is impaired.36 Although further work will be required to conclu-sively answer these questions , it is interesting to note that forced Sox2 expression in bone marrow-derived mesen-chymal stem cells MSC has been reported to promote their expansion and ability to differentiate into the osteoblastic lineage.37 Furthermore , several groups have described an anabolic effect of FGF treatment in vivo on bone formation , a finding that still awaits a mechanistic explanation.38�40 MSCs persist in adult organisms and are thought to contribute to the replacement of osteoblasts in bone turnover and fracture healing . It is tempting to speculate that the bone anabolic effect of FGF in vivo results from its ability to induce Sox2 and expand the pool of osteoprogenitor cells or of MSCs that commit to the osteoblastic lineage . If this hypothesis is correct , compounds that mimic or induce Sox2 expression in the osteoblastic lineage could be useful bone anabolic agents .

20671749	Serine 312 phosphorylation is wild-type p53 functions in MK Lee1 , WM Tong2 , ZQ Wang3,4 and K Sabapathy* , 1,5,6 dispensable for Regulation of p53 function is extremely crucial for the proper functioning of a cell , and thus the organism , as p53 activation restricts growth , whereas its functional loss leads to tumorigenesis.1,2 Expectedly , p53 is found inactivated in most tumors , 3 and activation of p53 is only noted in extreme conditions when cells are subjected to stress , as physio-logically , cells can not tolerate activated p53.4,5 Deregulated p53 activation leads to embryonic death , as shown in the case of the Mdm2 and Mdm4 deficient mice , 1 and also results in a dwarfed phenotype observed in mice expressing a mutant hyperactive p53.1 Collectively , all these findings highlight the need for precise regulation of p53 function for physiological processes to ensue . Not surprisingly , p53 is a labile protein whose levels are kept minimal primarily by the ubiquitin ligase Mdm2.6 Several post-translational modifications PTMs including acetylation and phosphorylation have also been suggested to regulate p53�s turnover.7 Acetylation at the carboxyl-terminal lysines have been shown to be important for Mdm2-dependent degradation.8 Furthermore , phosphorylation at the amino-terminal sites have been shown to be crucial for disrupting Mdm2 binding , and hence , critical for p53 stabilization.9 Most of the phosphorylation sites on p53 are clustered in its amino-and carboxyl-terminals.7 Critical amino-terminal sites suggested to regulate p53 function include the serine S residues 15 , 20 and 46.10 Among the carboxyl-terminal sites , S392 had been shown to be specifically regulated by ultra violet UV irradiation but not by IR � highlighting signal specificity � and seems to have a part in regulating optimal p53 functions.11 Other carboxyl-terminal sites , such as S315 , S373 and S376 have also been implicated to varying extents.10,12 Many of the phosphorylation sites are often modified in response to stress signals , 7 consistent with the notion that phosphorylation regulates p53 functions during the SOS response . However , the S315 site has been suggested to be unique , being regulated during cell-cycle progression and also upon endoplasmic-reticulum ER stress , an event in which p53 is not upregulated , besides genotoxic stress.10,12�16 Two seemingly opposite sets of results have emerged from the analysis of the S315 site in mouse and human cell lines � one which highlights the importance of this phosphorylation site for proper p53 functioning , and the other which highlights its role in leading to p53 degradation.12,13 One possible explanation for these conflicting findings is that these observations have been made using various phospho-mutant cDNAs , and therefore , the results may not absolutely reflect the physiological significance of the phosphorylation events because of the unusually high p53 levels in the overexpression systems . Thus , the solution to faithfully recapitulate physiological condi-tions rely on the recent advances in knock-in mouse models whereby the phosphorylable serine residues have been substituted to alainine residues � to mimic an unphosphory-lated state � in the germ-line of mice.1 We have therefore generated a knock-in S312A mutant mouse strain , in which the serine residue has been substituted with an unphosporyl-able alanine A residue , to evaluate the physiological importance of the S315 phosphorylation site . The detailed characterization of the p53S312A S312A mice is presented . Results Generation of p53S312A S312A knock-in mice . We first analyzed the protein sequence of p53 of various species by sequence alignment , which revealed that the S315 site and its neighboring sequences in human p53 are highly conver-sed among different species Supplementary Figure 1A , with the S312 residue in mouse p53 being the corresponding site Figure 1a .17 S312 has also been shown to be phos-phorylated on transformation in murine cell-based studies.18,19 To confirm this , we transfected p53 mouse embryonic fibroblasts MEFs with wild-type WT or S312A mouse p53 cDNAs and treated them with the ER-stress inducer thapsigargin TG 12 and analyzed the phosphorylation status . We observed increased phosphsorylation of WT p53 over time , whilst this was not the case in the S312A-transfected cells Supplementary Figure 1B , indicating that mouse S312 can indeed be phosphorylated in vivo . We therefore constructed the gene-targeting vector harboring the S312A mutation to generate �knock-in� mice to investigate the effects of the lack of this phosphorylation site in vivo Figure 1b .

The arrows indicate the fragments resulting from BstUI digestion of the S312A mutant transcript hybridization data not shown , and the neomycin cassette was excised to obtain p53 ? S312A ES cells that were blasto-cyst injected to generate the knock-in mice . Expression of the knock-in allele was confirmed by sequencing Figure 1c and by RT-PCR , wherein only the mutant p53 transcripts were detected in homozygous p53S312A S312A knock-in mice after BstUI digestion � which is specific to the S312A substitution � of the RT-PCR product Figure 1d . We have also sequenced the entire p53 transcript and found no additional mutations data not shown . p53S312A S312A mice are viable and mice of all genotypes were born at normal Mendelian and gender ratios Table 1 and data not shown . Of the 394 pups born , 104 were p53S312A S312A , in line with the expected number of 98.5 P ? 0.2018 Table 1 . Moreover , p53S312A S312A mice are fertile and give birth with normal litter size data not shown . Macroscopic analysis of homozygous mutant mice revealed no significant alterations , both during embryogenesis and in the adult stage up to 2 years of age data not shown . The S312A p53 is functional in both cultured cells and tissues . We first investigated if the p53S312A S312A mice could rescue the p53-dependent lethality due to Mdm2-defi-ciency . Offspring analysis from the p53S312A S312Amdm2 ? intercross revealed that the p53S312A S312A mutants could not rescue the Mdm2-deficiency-dependent lethality , as there were no p53S312A S312Amdm2 offsprings born , unlike the presence of the p53 mdm2 animals from control crosses Table 2 , suggesting that the S312A mutant p53 was not functionally compromised . We therefore investigated the biochemical properties of the S312A p53 protein using primary cells and tissues . The S312A p53 protein was phosphorylated at both S15 and S20 residues as efficiently as the WT protein , and showed a concomitant increase in the steady-state levels over time on g-irradiation , both in primary MEFs and thymocytes Figure 2a and Supplementary Figure 2A . Similar results were also obtained after UV irradiation of MEFs Figure 2b . Furthermore , whole body g-irradiation led to increased S312A p53 levels to similar extends as WT p53 in thymus and liver tissues Figure 2c , confirming that the induction of S312A protein is not compromised both in vitro and in vivo . It is noteworthy that p53 can be induced in livers of young mice20 Supplementary Figure 2B , unlike in the older mice which are found to be radioresistant.21 To evaluate whether S312A p53 is truly a functional protein , we investigated the expression of some classical p53-target genes in various organs thymus , spleen and liver and MEFs , which showed p53-dependent transactivation to similar extends and with similar kinetics in both WT and p53S312A S312A tissues and cells on g-irradiation Figure 2d . Moreover , cell-death rates were similar between p53S312A S312A and p53 ? ? thymocytes on g-irradiation over time and over various doses Figure 2e and data not shown , and were unlike p53 cells , indicating that the S312A protein is indeed functional . Analysis of cell-cycle progression also revealed that the growth rates were comparable between the p53S312A S312A and the p53 ? ? MEFs , unlike the fast growing p53 MEFs Figure 2f . Bromodeoxyuridine BrdU pulse-chase experiments confirmed these data p53S312A S312A versus p53 ? ? versus p53 20.76 % versus 22.57 % versus 40.69 % Supplementary Figure 3A . Furthermore , cycling kinetics of the BrdU ? cells was found to be similar between p53S312A S312A and p53 ? ? MEFs Supplementary Figure 3B . Analysis of total p53 levels , its subcellular localization and the expression of p53 target-genes and cyclins in synchronous cultures of p53S312A S312A and p53 ? ? MEFs also revealed no differences Supplementary Figure 3C and data not shown , suggesting that phosphorylation at S312 is not essential for cell-cycle progression under normal culture conditions . We therefore extended our investigations to evaluate whether stress-induced cell-cycle arrest was affected . Doxorubicin treatment or g-irradiation was found to effectively reduce the number of BrdU ? cells in both p53S312A S312A and p53 ? ? populations p53S312A S312A versus p53 ? ? versus p53 cells -doxorubicin 0.34�0.04 versus 0.48�0.16 versus 16.94�0.44 % g-irradiation 1.43�0.45 % versus 2.00�0.86 % versus 25.24�2.30 % p53S312A S312A versus p53 ? ? P ? 0.2381 for doxorubicin and P ? 0.3871 for g-irradiation Figure 2g , suggesting that S312 phosphorylation is also dispensable for stress-induced cell-cycle arrest . All these results together indicate that S312 phosphorylation is not required for proper p53 functioning under normal and stress conditions . p53 stability and ubiquitination is not affected in p53S312A S312A cells . As S315 phosphorylation was previously shown to reduce p53 stability , 12 we investigated the stability of S312A mutant p53 . The turnover rate of both WT and S312A p53 were found to be similar in cycloheximide pulse-chase experiments in unstressed MEFs T1 mins � S312A versus WT 15.79 versus 16.51 , 2 P ? 0.4168 Figure 3a . After g-irradiation , the half-life of p53 protein was significantly increased between 3 and 6 h in both cases Figure 3b , together suggesting that degra-dation of p53 may not be affected by the status of the S312 residue . As p53 is degraded in an ubiquitin Mdm2-dependent manner , 22�24 we assayed for ubiquitination and found both Table 1 S312A mice are born at Mendelian ratio Observed number of mice 80 210 104 Expected number of mice 98.5 197 98.5 The number of mice of various genotypes obtained by the p53+ S312A intercross is shown . The expected number of mice was calculated according to the total number of mice born and based on the expected Mendelian 1 2 1 ratio . Table 2 S312A mutant does not rescue Mdm2-dependent lethality WT and S312A p53 to be ubiquitinated to the same extend in unstressed cells Figure 3c . The ubiquitination was also reduced to similar extends on doxorubicin treatment . We further tested the physiological effects of inhibiting the association between p53 and Mdm2 , using nutlin which disrupts this association , which revealed that the numbers of BrdU ? cells were reduced to similar extends in both p53S312A S312A and p53 ? ? cultures , unlike p53 MEFs p53S312A S312A versus p53 ? ? versus p53 0.48�0.31 % versus 0.725�0.08 % versus 23.57�3.78 % p53S312A S312A versus p53 ? ? P ? 0.3703 Figure 3d . These data together show that the S312 residue is not required for regulation of p53 ubiquitination , stability and function , including that which is mediated by Mdm2 . S312 phosphorylation is dispensable for ER stress-induced cytoplasmic localization . Phosphorylation of S376 and S315 of human p53 has been shown to be necessary for the cytoplasmic localization on ER stress.12 However , we have recently reported that S373 phosphory-lation on mouse p53 the equivalent site of S376 of human p53 is dispensable for this process.25 We thus tested whether the presence of an unphosphorylable S312A p53 would affect its cytoplasmic localization on ER stress . Nuclear p53 levels were reduced on treatment with the ER stress-inducer TG in p53 ? ? MEFs Figure 4a , left . A similar reduction was also observed in p53S312A S312A MEFs Figure 4a , left , though p53 levels did not clearly and distinctly increase in the cytosolic fractions in both WT and p53S312A S312A cells Figure 4a , right . Therefore , to ascertain that the ER stress-induced nuclear p53 reduction is indeed due to increased nuclear export and not due to reduced translation , we used leptomycin B to block nuclear export of p53 . Leptomycin B treatment completely abrogated the reduction of p53 protein by ER stress in both p53 ? ? and p53S312A S312A MEFs Figure 4b , suggesting that both WT and S312A p53 proteins can be exported to cytosol effectively on ER stress , and perhaps not detected in the cytoplasmic fractions due to accelerated degradation . Consistently , TG treatment reduced nuclear p53 accumu-lation that occurred on UV-irradiation in both the WT and p53S312A S312A MEFs Figure 4c . Immunoblot analysis revealed that both WT and S312A p53 protein induction was compromised to similar extends in cells treated with TG before UV Figure 4d or g-irradiation data not shown , as previously published.12 Furthermore , analysis of p53 levels after TG IR hr 0 2 5 0 2 5 20 Viability treatment followed by g-irradiation confirmed that this pheno-menon also occurs in thymocytes Figure 4e . Taken together , it is evident that the S312A p53 can be exported out of the nucleus by ER stress regardless of stimuli and cell-type , suggesting that this phosphorylation site is not crucial in regulating the nuclear-cytoplasmic shutling of p53 . Centrosome duplication and carcinogenesis are not accentuated by the presence of S312A p53 . Human p53 has been shown to regulate centrosome duplication , partially through the phosphorylation of the S315 residue.26 Hence , we tested whether centrosome duplication was affected in p53S312A S312A MEFs . Most of the untreated WT or p53S312A S312A MEFs have one or two centrosome s per cell , whereas the p53 cells showed a slight increase in the number of cells having three or more centrosomes percentage of cells with three or more centrosomes in p53S312A S312A versus p53 ? ? versus p53 MEFs 4.326� 0.71 versus 4.043�0.88 versus 11.77�1.46 p53S312A S312A versus p53 ? ? P ? 0.918 , and p53 ? ? versus p53 Po0.0001 Figure 5a . Treatment with hydroxyurea leads to inhibition of DNA synthesis and arrest in S-phase , although centrosome duplication continues , and p53 has been shown to suppress the re-duplication of duplicated centrosomes.26 Hydroxyurea treatment resulted in majority of the p53S312A S312A and p53 ? ? MEFs having two centrosomes per cell , whereas most p53 MEFs had three or more centrosomes per cell percentage of p53S312A S312Aversus p53 ? ? versus p53 MEFs with one centrosome per cell 12.25�1.71 versus 16.5�1.18 versus 4.22�0.98 with two centrosomes per cell 54.47�4.19 versus 54.95�2.22 versus 13.11�5.9 % and with three or more centrosomes per cell 27.71�3.39 versus 22.33�1.46 versus 82.67�5.87 p53S312A S312A versus p53 ? ? P ? 0.0632 and p53 ? ? versus p53 Po0.0001 for three or more centrosomes per cell Figure 5a . These results indicated that functional p53 is indeed important for regulating centrosome duplication , and the presence of the S312A p53 was sufficient for this process . We next evaluated whether the p53S312A S312A mice were susceptible to cancer formation , in three different contexts spontaneous tumor formation , after DNA-damage by g-irradiation and in the presence of the Em-myc oncogene . Unlike p53 mice that succumb to spontaneous tumors between 3�6 months of age , p53S312A S312A homozygous mice did not develop any spontaneous tumors up to 2 years data not shown . Therefore , the effect of g-irradiation 4 Gy was investigated by irradiating 5-week-old mice and monitor-ing over time . Though there was a decrease in the survival of irradiated mice , there was no statistically significant difference between the median survival of the p53S312A S312A and p53 ? ? mice median survival weeks of p53S312A S312A versus p53 ? ? mice after IR 44.9 versus 45.7 , P ? 0.8822 time + BrdU 15 Figure 5b , suggesting that S312 phosphorylation is not important for the tumor suppressive activity of p53 on genotoxic insult . Finally , the effects of the S312A protein were analyzed in oncogene-induced carcinogenesis , using the Em-myc trans-genic mice . Whereas the survival of the Em-mycTg p53 ? mice was dramatically reduced compared with that of Em-mycTg p53 ? ? mice median survival weeks of Em-mycTg p53 ? versus Em-mycTg p53 ? ? mice 6.36 versus 19.0 , Po0.0001 , there was no significant difference in the survival between Em-mycTg p53S312A S312A and Em-mycTg p53 ? ? mice median survival weeks of Em-mycTg p53S312A S312A versus Em-mycTg p53 ? ? mice 19.00 versus 19.57 , P ? 0.7903 Figure 5c , indicating that the S312A p53 is indeed functionally active as WT p53 . Nevertheless , we performed microarray analysis to detect any subtle differences using B-lymphoma cells , and found the gene expression profiles from the Em-mycTg p53S312A S312A and Em-mycTg p53 ? ? mice to be almost identical Supple-mentary Figure 4 . These data lead us to conclude that the S312 phosphorylation of mouse p53 is dispensable for its tumor-suppressor functions . Discussion The data presented in this study , show that altering the S312 residue of mouse p53 does not affect any of the known functions of p53 both in vitro and in vivo , indicating that this phosphorylation site may not be relevant in the regulation of p53 function . S312 phosphorylation was noted more than two decades ago in mouse NIH3T3 cells , specifically on SV40-transformation.18,19 p53 Tubulin 60 50 TG Subsequent studies have identified several kinases that phosphorylate this site and documented the effects of this phosphorylation event , with results being not congruent at all times . For example , initial studies indicated that S315 was phosphorylated by the cell-cycle regulated p34cdc2 kinase , 16 as well as on UV irradiation.13 Nevertheless , both the S312A and the S315A mutants were found to be defective neither in their transactivation ability , 10,27 nor in their stability and cytoplasmic-nuclear translocation , 28�30 leading to the conclu-sion that phosphorylation at S312 S315 may regulate other functions of p53 . However , subsequent studies suggested that phosphorylation on this site led to decreased tetramer stability , 31 and that the S315A mutant had reduced transacti-vation potential.13 Recent studies have suggested a critical role for this site in regulating centrosome duplication , 26 and in the nuclear retention and binding affinity of p53 to target genes.14 Conversely , ER stress was reported to activate GSK3b , which was shown to phosphorylate S315 , leading to its cytoplasmic export.12 Consistently , Aurora A was shown to phosphorylate p53 at this site leading to ubiquitination by Mdm2,32 and consequently , S315A was shown to be retained in the nucleus and less ubiquitinated . Collectively , these in vitro-derived data indicated that the S312 S315 phosphory-lation may be important in the regulation of p53 function , though to varying degrees and probably in a context-dependent manner . We therefore embarked on evaluating the effect of this phosphorylation site in vivo by generating a knock-in mutant mouse strain . To our surprise , we did not observe any defects in transactivation , cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis , inhibition of centrosome amplification and tumor formation under various conditions . Moreover , the S312A mutant p53 was also unable to rescue embryonic lethality due to Mdm2 deficiency , altogether indicating that the S312A mutant behaves absolutely as a WT p53 protein in all aspects we have tested . These findings have several implications . First , this phos-phorylation site may not be important in the physiological context on its own , as has been suggested by some of the in vitro studies . This conclusion has several parallels . Abrogation of S23 human S20 equivalent and S389 human S389 equivalent phosphorylation sites did not significantly alter the general response to irradiation , 1,33�36 except for UV irradiation in the later context , suggesting that most of the major functions of p53 can be carried out regardless of the phosphorylation status at these residues . Thus , the general effectiveness of the phospho-mutant proteins suggests that these phosphorylation events may not be essential in regulating acute p53 functions by themselves . Although single phospho-mutant p53 knock-in mice behaved very similar to the WT mice , the S18 23A mutant , in which both S18 and S23 residues are unphosphorylatable , is almost completely defective in apoptosis and developed an array of spontaneous tumors , 1,33�36 showing that mutating multiple phosphorylation sites have synergistic effects on p53 functions . Therefore , it is possible that mice in which multiple phosphoryla-tion sites such as S18 23 312A are altered may reveal the functional significance of S312 , and requires further investigation . Second , as the S315 phosphorylation site is one that is not regulated by DNA damage only , 12,14 it is not surprising that lack of this phosphorylation site does not alter any DNA damage-dependent functions of the knock-in mice , even after 2 years of age . This is unlike the S23A and S389A mice which develop tumors much later in life , probably on accumulation of genetic anomalies over time.1,33 Nevertheless , no defects on ER stress were also observed in these mutant cells , raising the possibility that this site is indeed dispensable for all tested p53 functions . However , we can not exclude the possibility that a phenotype may be apparent in sensitized backgrounds . A salient point that requires consideration is whether the phosphorylation sites of mouse p53 are indeed functionally equivalent to their human counterparts . As noted earlier , the S15 , S20 and S392 sites are thought to be critical residues in regulating p53 function , but knock-in mice do not show major defects.34�36 Thus , it is not inconceivable that the phosphory-lation sites may have evolved to be functionally more relevant in humans and are largely dispensable in mice or other lower organisms . In support of this idea , mouse ES cells expressing a human-mouse hybrid hupki S315A mutant p53 protein S315 residue is located in the region of human p53 expressed from the endogenous locus seems to have some defects in p53-mediated gene regulation , 37 suggesting that the observed defects may be due to a combinatorial effect of the presence of human p53 sequence and unphosphorylable S315 residue . Moreover , Drosophila p53 is phosphorylated on stress but the protein levels remain unchanged , 38 contrary to the dogma that phosphorylation is generally critical for regulating p53 stability in mouse and human cells.9,17 Furthermore , acetylation of p53 was shown to be critical in human cells , but ablating all seven acetylatable lysine residues did not have any major effect on p53 functions in mice.1 In addition , the codon 72 polymorphism that seems to differentially affect the apoptotic activity of human p53 is absent in mouse p53.39 Altogether , subtle modifications on p53 by PTMs or otherwise seem to be more relevant in the human cellular context rather than the mouse environment � probably because of the proposed weaker activity of human p53 compared with mouse p5339 � and hence , elaborated to regulate human p53 activity exquisitely . In conclusion , the findings presented in this study show that altering the S312 to an unphosphorylable alanine residue does not affect any of the known major functions of p53 in mice . This suggests that either single residue substitutions may not be sufficient to discern a phenotype , or that the S312 phosphorylation is neither relevant in the mouse context nor important for p53 functions in vivo . Materials and Methods Generation and breeding of p53S312A S312A knock-in mice .

20814419	www.nature.com cdd In type II diabetes T2DM , hyperglycemia is because of inadequate insulin secretion in response to relative insulin resistance . The islet in T2DM is characterized by a deficit in b-cells , 1,2 increased b-cell apoptosis attributable to endoplas-mic reticulum ER stress3,4 and intracellular b-cell toxic aggregates of the amyloidogenic protein islet amyloid poly-peptide IAPP , 5 the expression of which increases with insulin resistance.6 IAPP is co-expressed and co-secreted with insulin by b-cells7 with its best-characterized physio-logical role being to inhibit insulin secretion through a direct paracrine effect on b-cells.8 IAPP has the propensity to form amyloid fibrils in species at risk of T2DM humans , non-human primates and cats .9 In contrast to human-IAPP h-IAPP , the rodent form of IAPP r-IAPP is non-amyloidogenic . Trans-genic expression of h-IAPP in b-cells of rodents at rates present in insulin resistance leads to the development of diabetes because of ER stress-induced b-cell apoptosis with formation of membrane-damaging intracellular IAPP oligomers comparable to those present in humans with T2DM.3,5,10�12 Conserved mechanisms protect long-lived cells with a high protein synthetic burden such as b-cells from accumulation of intracellular protein aggregates and the adverse conse-quences termed proteotoxicity.9 A quality control system in the ER recognizes misfolded proteins and targets them for degradation by the ubiquitin proteasome system.13 A second pathway of protein degradation , autophagy , also implies a role for ubiquitin in removal of misfolded proteins.14 Macroauto-phagy hereafter referred to as autophagy permits selective autodigestion of aged or abnormal organelles and clearance of ubiquitinated proteins.14 An isolation membrane forms in the cytoplasm to surround such targets through the activity of specific autophagy effectors.15 Among such effectors , micro-tubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 LC3 is cleaved into a soluble form known as LC3-I , which undergoes covalent conjugation to phosphatidylethanolamine to form an auto-phagosome-bound LC3-II.16 This lipidated form of LC3-I allows the nascent double membrane to wrap around intracellular cargo to form autophagosomes that then fuse with the lysosomes where the sequestered material is degraded by hydrolytic enzymes . Recognition of polyubiquitinated proteins destined for degradation by autophagy is mediated by the p62 sequesto-some 1 SQSTM1 through its ubiquitin-binding UBA do-main.17 Also , p62 possesses a LC3 interaction region LIR that facilitates direct interaction with LC3 in the autophago-some and causes p62 to be itself degraded by autophagy . Thus , p62 serves to target ubiquitinated proteins or organelles to autophagy.17 Predictably , p62 accumulates and forms cytoplasmic inclusions in autophagy-deficient mice e.g. , in liver and neurons as the mechanism to remove accumulating p62 and its sequestrated target is lost . Based on these observations , accumulation of p62 has become established as a marker for impaired autophagy and or defects in lysosomal degradation.18,19 Given the presence of membrane-permeant toxic oligomers in b-cells in humans with T2DM as well as in h-IAPP transgenic rodents , by definition the mechanisms to remove intracellular protein oligomers under these conditions are either defective or overwhelmed . In the present studies we approached the question of whether the increased h-IAPP expression present under conditions of insulin resistance compromises autophagy , and if so , whether this increases the vulnerability of b-cells to apoptosis . To address this , we first tested the hypothesis that high expression of amyloidogenic h-IAPP either by gene dosage or by obesity leads to impaired autophagy . We studied rodent models that collectively permitted us to affirm the hypothesis , independent of the confounding effects of hyperglycemia or nonspecific overload of the ER . We next hypothesized that suppression of the p62-mediated removal of ubiquitinated proteins leads to increased vulnerability of b-cells to h-IAPP-induced apoptosis . Conversely , we hypothesized that enhanced p62 availability decreases b-cell vulnerability to h-IAPP toxicity . Finally , we hypothesized that inhibition of the degradation of proteins sequestered by autophagy increases vulnerability of b-cells to h-IAPP-induced apoptosis and that enhanced autophagy protects b-cells from h-IAPP-induced apoptosis . Results Increased expression of h-IAPP in b-cells in vivo induces defective autophagy that precedes development of hyperglycemia . The number of autophagosomes was assessed by the conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II . In h-IAPP transgenic rat HIP rat islets , a twofold increase in LC3-II was observed in comparison to wild-type WT rats Figure 1a , indicating an increased number of autophagosomes , which could be because of either enhanced autophagosome formation or a decrease in lysosomal degradation . To resolve this issue , p62 protein levels were examined . The protein levels of p62 were increased in HIP rat islets 1.8�0.4-fold versus WT rats , Po0.05 Figure 1a . In contrast , p62 mRNA levels were comparable in islets of HIP and WT rats Figure 1b , indicating that the increase in p62 protein levels in HIP rats is most probably because of a decrease in p62 lysosomal degradation . Immunostaining for p62 revealed the presence of p62-positive cytoplasmic inclusions in b-cells of HIP but not WT rats Figure 1c . Different sizes of cytoplasmic inclusions were found , ranging from punctuate aggregates Figure 1c , i and ii to large globular structures Figure 1c , iii . These data suggest that high expression of h-IAPP leads to increased number of autophagosomes , accumulation of p62 and formation of p62-positive cytoplasmic inclusions , which may be due , at least in part , to impairment of lysosomal degradation in b-cells in vivo . The action of h-IAPP to induce defective autophagy in vivo depends on its oligomeric properties . To investi - gate whether disruption of autophagy by h-IAPP depends on its propensity to form toxic oligomers , we examined islets of mice with comparable transgenic b-cell expression of the oligomeric human form of IAPP h-TG versus the soluble rodent form of IAPP r-TG . Toxic oligomers of h-IAPP form intracellularly in b-cells of h-TG but not r-TG mice , and h-TG but not r-TG mice develop diabetes.12 LC3-II levels in islets isolated from h-TG mice were increased 5.9�1.9-fold , Po0.05 when compared with r-TG mice Figure 2a , indicating an increased number of autophagosomes . The p62 levels in islets from h-TG mice were also increased 8.4�2.8-fold , Po0.05 when compared with r-TG mice Figures 2a and b . The mRNA levels of p62 were increased by 1.2-fold in islets of h-TG mice versus r-TG mice Po0.05 , Figure 2c , indicating that the 8.4-fold increase in p62 protein levels in h-TG mice was most likely because of a decrease in p62 lysosomal degradation . In h-TG but not r-TG mice , we detected by western blot a high molecular weight band corresponding to that previously reported to be composed of tightly aggregated p62.19 Consistent with the western blots , intracellular deposits of p62 were identified by immunohistochemistry in b-cells of h-TG mice , but not in r-TG or WT mice Figure 2d . These inclusions ranged from small punctuate aggregates to filamentous structures and large globular inclusions Figure 2d , i , ii and iii , comparable to those noted in HIP rats Figure 1c . We conclude that the action of IAPP to disrupt lysosomal clearance of p62 depends on the property of h-IAPP to form toxic oligomers , and not just the synthetic burden of IAPP . Obesity exacerbates h-IAPP-induced defective autophagy . We examined changes in autophagy in the context of islet adaptation to obesity without development of diabetes obese non-transgenic ONT versus lean non-transgenic LNT , as well as in the context of failed adaptation to obesity with development of diabetes obese transgenic OT versus obese non-transgenic ONT Supplementary Table 1 . First , we examined islets from obese versus lean mice to investigate the effect of obesity on autophagy in the absence of oligomeric h-IAPP . In islets from ONT mice , there was a 1.7-fold increase in LC3-II levels in comparison to LNT mice Figure 3a . Although p62 protein levels remained unchanged Figures 3a and b , p62 mRNA expression was increased in ONT versus LNT mice Figure 3c . This suggests that in the presence of obesity-induced insulin resistance , b-cells stimu-late autophagic flux to manage the increased synthetic burden of insulin and IAPP.6 In these mice , the increased p62 mRNA expression might be crucial to deal with the consequences of the increased protein burden . We then investigated the effect of hemizygous expression of h-IAPP on lean mice . In islets from lean transgenic mice LT , we detected an increase in LC3-II levels 2.9�0.5-fold , Po0.01 Figure 3a associated with an increase in p62 protein levels B3-fold , Po0.05 Figures 3a and b when compared with LNT mice . The levels of p62 mRNA were comparable in islets from LNT and LT mice Figure 3c . These data show that hemizygous expression of h-IAPP , although insufficient to induce diabetes , is sufficient to impair lysosome-dependent degradation . Finally , to investigate the interactive effects of obesity and h-IAPP on autophagy , we examined islets from OT versus LT mice . In islets from OT mice , we detected a 1.8-fold increase in LC3-II Figure 3a and a twofold increase in p62 protein levels Figures 3a and b when compared with LT . Thus , obesity exacerbates the impairment of autophagic clearance already present in lean h-IAPP transgenic animals . To complement western blot results , we assessed p62 protein expression using immunofluorescence . Although p62 protein levels measured by western blot were similar in islets from ONT versus LNT mice , the number of b-cells containing detectable labeling for p62 was higher in ONT mice 1.5�0.2 versus 0.5�0.2 % , Po0.05 Figures 3d and e . This differ-ence might be explained by the changes in distribution of p62 within cells . In contrast to islets from LNT mice containing weak punctuated p62 labeling , in islets from ONT we detected bright clusters of p62 punctuates Figure 3g , which occupied 0.03 % of the b-cell area Figure 3f . In lean mice , hemizygous expression of h-IAPP caused an increase in the number of b-cells positive for p62 1.6�0.5 versus 0.5�0.2 % in LNT , Po0.05 Figures 3d and e , as well as the formation of large p62-positive inclusions taking up 0.35�0.05 % of the b-cell area Figure 3f . In islets from OT mice , we not only detected an increase in the number of b-cells stained for p62 4�0.8 % , Po0.05 versus LT Figure 3e , but also an increase in the number and size of p62-positive inclusions , which occupied 0.7�0.15 % of the b-cell area Po0.01 versus LT Figure 3f . The presence of p62-positive inclusions in islets from LT mice , which was exacerbated by obesity , further supports a defect in lysosomal degradation . We conclude that the healthy islet adaptation to obesity includes enhanced autophagy to compensate for increased protein demand , which is linked to efficient lysosomal clearance . However , in mice prone to the islet phenotype of T2DM because of the expression of oligomeric h-IAPP , obesity leads to defective autophagy and exacerbates impaired lysosomal degradation already apparent at lower expression levels of h-IAPP in lean mice . h-IAPP expression increases autophagosomes and p62 levels in a b-cell line , with p62 levels subsequently declining in relation to h-IAPP-induced apoptosis . To further investigate the role of p62 accumulation in b-cells of h-IAPP transgenic rodents , we used the INS 832 13 rat insulinoma cell line cells transduced with adenoviruses expressing h-IAPP or the non-amyloidogenic and non-toxic r-IAPP for comparable load of protein.20 Cells transduced with h-IAPP exhibited a B5-fold increase in LC3-II levels after 36 and 48 h Po0.01 , suggesting either an induction of autophagy or a decrease in autophagosome clearance Figure 4 , comparable to that reported above in vivo . In cells transduced with r-IAPP , LC3-II levels were also increased at 48 h 3.2�0.3-fold , Po0.001 , but to a much lesser extent than in cells transduced with h-IAPP Figure 4 . Although transduction of cells with h-IAPP adenovirus induced a transient increase in p62 protein levels , with a maximal effect observed at 24 h 1.6�0.1-fold , Po0.05 Figure 4 , transduction of cells with r-IAPP adenovirus did not affect p62 protein levels . Of interest , the increase in p62 levels detected in h-IAPP-transduced cells was followed by a rapid decline in p62 protein levels at 36 and 48 h . This decline in p62 protein levels was coincident with h-IAPP-induced apoptosis shown by the cleavage of caspase-3 Figure 4 and Supplementary Figure 2 , implying a role for p62 in b-cell survival . Loss of p62 renders b-cells more vulnerable to h-IAPP-induced toxicity . To evaluate whether p62 has a role in b-cell survival , the expression of p62 was specifically silenced by shRNA lentivirus in INS 832 13 cells . Increasing concentrations of shRNA lentivirus for 72 h resulted in a dose-dependent knockdown of p62 protein content and gradual emergence of cleaved caspase-3 Figure 5a . To determine whether a decrease in p62 expression exacerbates h-IAPP-induced apoptosis , we transduced INS 832 13 cells with p62 shRNA or control shRNA 48 h and transduced these cells with h-IAPP or r-IAPP adenoviruses for 27 h . As expected , knockdown of p62 increased the cleavage of caspase-3 in comparison to control shRNA-transduced cells Figure 5b . Furthermore , the knockdown of p62 in the presence of high expression of h-IAPP induced a significant increase in caspase-3 cleavage versus r-IAPP-transduced cells Figure 5b , Po0.001 . This shows that p62 knockdown exacerbates h-IAPP toxicity , supporting the hypothesis that p62 accumulation serves a protective role in b-cells stressed by h-IAPP expression . Increased p62 protein expression reduces h-IAPP - induced b-cell apoptosis . To further evaluate the protective role of p62 against h-IAPP-induced b-cell apoptosis , we overexpressed p62 in INS 832 13 cells transduced with h-IAPP adenovirus . The p62-GFP fusion protein was efficiently expressed in cells and the transfected cells displayed cytoplasmic inclusions that appeared as two distinct types based on size Figure 6a , right panels , comparable to those in b-cells of h-IAPP transgenic rodents . The size , number and intensity of labeling of these inclusions increased with increasing p62 expression levels data not shown . p62-GFP colocalized with the autophagic marker LC3-RFP red fluorescent protein fused to LC3 in these cytoplasmic inclusions Supplementary Figure 1 , suggesting that p62-GFP behaves as endogenous p62 in INS 832 13 cells . Expression of p62-GFP in cells caused a 26 % decrease in h-IAPP-induced apoptosis in comparison to GFP plasmid-transfected cells used as control Po0.05 Figure 6b . Thus , increased expression of p62 reduces h-IAPP toxicity and this protective effect might be mediated by the formation of large p62-cytoplasmic inclusions in b-cells . Inhibition of lysosomal degradation exacerbates h-IAPP-induced b-cell apoptosis . The accumulation of p62-positive inclusions and the increase in autophagosome number increased LC3-II induced by h-IAPP expression implies that a high expression of h-IAPP impairs lysosome function . To test whether inhibition of lysosomal degradation exacerbates h-IAPP-induced b-cell death , we treated INS 832 13 cells transduced or not with h-IAPP with E-64-d pepstatin A , the inhibitors of proteases in the lysosome . As control , LC3-II and p62 protein levels were increased in cells treated with these inhibitors , confirming the accumulation of autophagosomes and p62 data not shown . Inhibition of lysosomal degradation increased h-IAPP-induced apoptosis measured by the cleavage of caspase-3 1.6-fold increased versus non-treated h-IAPP-transduced cells , Po0.05 Figure 7a . To further confirm the observation that lysosomal function is important to protect b-cells from h-IAPP toxicity in primary cells , we repeated these studies in islets isolated from HIP rats and WT rats . In WT rat islets treated with lysosomal inhibitors , an accumulation of LC3-II and p62 was clearly detected , demonstrating that p62 is degraded by lysosomes in pancreatic islets data not shown , similar to other cell types.21 Inhibition of lysosomal degradation in HIP rat islets further increased the accumulation of polyubiquitinated proteins , and this was not observed in treated WT rat islets Figure 7b . Inhibition of lysosomal activity in HIP rat islets led to increased cleavage of caspase-3 1.7-fold increased versus non-treated HIP rat islets , Po0.01 Figure 7b and Supplementary Figure 3 . These data show that h-IAPP-induced apoptosis is exacerbated by inhibition of lysosome-dependent clearance in INS 832 13 cells as well as in primary b-cells that express h-IAPP . Enhanced autophagy decreases h-IAPP-induced b-cell apoptosis . Having established that inhibition of autophagy lysosomal degradation exacerbates h-IAPP-induced b-cell apoptosis , we next tested whether enhancement of autophagy can rescue cells from h-IAPP-induced apoptosis . We stimulated autophagy with rapamycin , an inhibitor of the mammalian target of rapamycin m-TOR signaling pathway . Cells treated with rapamycin showed decreased phosphorylation of m-TOR that indicates a stimulation of autophagosome formation Figure 8 , top panel . Treatment of h-IAPP-transduced cells with rapamycin significantly reduced the cleavage of caspase-3 66 % decrease versus non-treated h-IAPP-transduced cells , Po0.001 Figure 8 . It also decreased the modest cleavage of caspase-3 induced by r-IAPP transduction Figure 8 . These data demonstrate that rapamycin , by enhancing the autophagy pathway , protects b-cells against h-IAPP-induced apoptosis . Discussion These studies provide evidence that increased expression of h-IAPP , as occurs with insulin resistance , impairs autophagy lysosome-dependent degradation in b-cells , and that this action of h-IAPP to perturb lysosomal clearance of misfolded proteins in vivo depends on its propensity to form toxic oligomers . As we established that inhibition of lysosomal degradation increases vulnerability of b-cells to h-IAPP-induced toxicity and , con-versely , stimulation of autophagy protects b-cells from h-IAPP-induced apoptosis , the property of h-IAPP to disrupt this protection against proteotoxicity is revealed as a potentially adverse self-sustaining cycle . The p62 scaffold protein is revealed to have an important role in sequestering misfolded proteins in b-cells and as such has a protective role against proteotoxicity induced by misfolded amyloidogenic proteins . The potential role of p62 in defense against h-IAPP-induced toxicity was examined in detail after we noted accumulation of p62 protein in b-cells expressing h-IAPP . Similar p62-positive inclusions have been reported in brains from individuals with neurodegenerative diseases , including Alzheimer and Parkinson�s diseases.22,23 In b-cells as in neurons , 24 these intracytoplasmic inclusions appeared as either small punc-tate spots B0.5 mm or in much larger globular structures 1 to 2 mm . Typically , the larger p62-positive inclusions called sequestosomes are not surrounded by a membrane , and the smaller structures are surrounded by membranes and have thus been termed autophagosomes.25 The role of the p62-positive inclusions and their relationship to cell survival appears to be condition and or cell-type specific . Besides its role in selective delivery of ubiquitinated proteins to the autophagosome , p62 acts as a scaffold in several signaling pathways crucial for cell survival and or apoptosis.26 Mice deficient in p62 develop an Alzheimer-like phenotype with neurodegeneration.27 Huntingtin-induced neuronal death in cells was increased after depletion of p62.25 In contrast , removal of p62 in autophagy-deficient hepatocytes attenuates liver injury.18 Additionally , accumu-lation of p62 can also compromise proteasomal degradation , ultimately leading to cell death.28 In our studies , we found that decreased p62 availability led to increased vulnerability of b-cells to h-IAPP-induced apoptosis . Enhanced p62 levels and p62 inclusion formation were associated with reduced h-IAPP-induced b-cell apoptosis . Given these findings and the similarities between pan-creatic b-cells in T2DM and neurons in neurodegenerative diseases , we propose that p62-positive inclusions may sequester misfolded proteins or damaged organelles to protect b-cells from toxicity and may thereby delay or abolish b-cell dysfunction and apoptosis induced by misfolded h-IAPP . Although we propose that p62 has a protective role against misfolded h-IAPP , it can be predicted that marked accumulation of p62 may be associated with b-cell dysfunc-tion and apoptosis , as noted by use of lysosomal inhibitors . Thus , although p62 sequestration of misfolded proteins may serve as a buffer against proteotoxicity , ultimately the p62 protein-bound targets for degradation must be removed and degraded through the autophagy lysosomal pathway to effect this protection over the longer term . It is therefore not surprising that b-cell-specific knockout of the key autophagy initiator gene Atg7 autophagy-related protein 7 in mice led to glucose intolerance , reduced insulin secretion and diminished b-cell mass because of increased b-cell apoptosis.29,30 The accumulation of large aggregates positive for p62 and ubiquitin was also reported in b-cells of these autophagy-deficient mice.29,30 Both increased number of autophagosomes and intracellular h-IAPP oligomers have been noted in b-cells in humans with T2DM.5,31 In h-IAPP transgenic rodents , we noted increased autophagosomes that coincided with an accumulation of p62 protein levels , implying that the action of h-IAPP to increase the number of autophagosomes was secondary to impaired lysosomal clearance . However , initiation of autophagic vacuole forma-tion and lysosomal clearance are inextricably linked and we can not exclude a simultaneous role of h-IAPP in enhance-ment of autophagosome formation and alteration of lysosomal degradation . The most common risk factor for T2DM is obesity that , by its actions to induce insulin resistance , leads to a marked increase in IAPP and insulin expression.6 We show in this study that obesity in the absence of oligomeric h-IAPP prompts an increase in autophagosome formation , consistent with a previous report.29 We extend those findings to note that increased autophagosome formation is accompanied by prompt delivery of p62 targets to autophagosomes from which there is efficient lysosomal clearance . In contrast , in mice expressing h-IAPP this b-cell adaptation to obesity fails , reproducing the findings in humans with T2DM.5 We conclude that h-IAPP-induced proteotoxicity may be exacer-bated by an action of h-IAPP oligomers targeted for destruction to disrupt their own clearance by the autophagy lysosomal pathway . Toxic h-IAPP oligomers , like other soluble amyloid oligo-mers in protein misfolding diseases , have been shown to impose cellular toxicity by formation of nonselective ion channels , resulting in disruption of membranes.32,33 h-IAPP toxic oligomers may disrupt autophagosomal and or lysoso-mal membranes . This loss of membrane fidelity may impair transport of autophagosomes to lysosomes and or disrupt autophagosome lysosome fusion . Also , toxic membrane disrupting oligomers may impair function of the lysosomal proton pump and induce missorting or leakage of lyso-somal enzymes , leading to failure to effectively degrade lysosomal contents because of impaired enzyme activation.34�37 In conclusion , the p62 autophagy lysosomal pathway , which is shown to be important in protection of b-cells against proteotoxicity , is impaired by expression of h-IAPP at rates sufficient to induce apoptosis . This action of h-IAPP to render b-cells more vulnerable to toxic oligomer-induced toxicity is a potential target for b-cell protection in T2DM . Materials and Methods Animal models .

21052095	Tumor suppression largely function via the p53�p21WAF1�HDM2 pathway for promotion of cell growth arrest , senescence , or programmed cell death to eliminate damaged cells or to halt neoplastic activities.1 We had previously isolated an alter-native reading frame ARF -binding protein , Collaborator of ARF CARF , which functions in regulation of p53-mediated tumor suppression.2 Further , we discovered that the CARF protein is a vital regulator of p53-dependent senescence and apoptosis , and the determinant of cell fate is reliant on the dosage or level of CARF.3 CARF is critical for cell cycle progression , and CARF-compromised cells display hallmarks of mitotic catastrophe MC including hypercondensed chromatin , polyploidy , as well as deranged spindle fiber and centrosome assemblies . In this study , we sought to elucidate the mechanisms responsible for CARF-suppression-induced cell death and its in vivo effects . MC is characterized by mitotic arrest accompanied by increases in histone H3 , cyclin B1 and cyclin-dependent kinase 1 and deregulation of the cell cycle checkpoints , culminating into cell death.4 Although a clear definition of MC is lacking , it is widely considered as a mode of apoptosis owing to accompanying changes in mitochondrial membrane potential and caspase activation.5 Regulation of the cell survival and death processes has been largely attributed to p53-dependent and p53-independent pathways involving www.nature.com cdd retinoblastoma RB , E2F1 , p21WAF1 , Ras�mitogen-activated protein kinases MAPK and ataxia telangiectasia mutated ATM ATM-and RAD3-related ATR functions.6�9 The latter serve as prime mediators of the DNA damage response , instigating apoptosis through Ras�MAPK , RB�E2F1 and ARF�p53�p21WAF1 or mitotic DNA damage checkpoint mediated by the BRCA1 and CHK1 pathways.10�14 In the present study , we report that the suppression of CARF induces MC accompanied by activation of the mitochondrial stress and caspase-dependent pathways via induction of DNA damage and disruption of the cell cycle checkpoint regulation , culminating into apoptosis of cancer cells . Furthermore , in an in vivo tumor model using adeno-oncolytic virus armed with CARF siRNA , complete suppres-sion of tumors was observed , suggesting that CARF siRNA is a strong candidate for antitumor therapy . Results CARF-silencing-induced cell death is p53-independent and involves the mitochondrial stress pathway . We previously showed that the suppression of CARF compromised p53 function causing reduction in the level of p21WAF1 expression.15 However , it remained unclear whether functional compromise of p53 was critically involved in the cell death phenotype . CARF-silencing induced cell death in HeLa compromised p53 function owing to the presence of human papilloma virus Figure 1a , DLD-1 and C33A mutant p53 data not shown , as well as in HCT116 p53 cells Figure 1b . These data indicated that p53 is not a crucial Phase Hoechst TUNEL Histone H3 Cleaved caspase 3 -Tubulin Actin CARF Cyclin B1 H3 ATM ATR Ras CHK1 CHK2 factor for CARF-silencing-induced cell death and hence , other factors and pathways warranted further investigations . We utilized CARF siRNA in U2OS functional wild-type p53 and HeLa cells and examined the expression of cyclin B1 and histone H3 crucial regulators of mitosis and major markers of MC .5 As shown in Figure 1c , cyclin B1 and histone H3 were increased following CARF suppression . In contrast to the predominantly pancytoplasmic cyclin B1 in normal cycling cells , cyclin B1 accumulated in the nucleus of CARF-compromised cells Figure1d , arrows , which exhibited compact and condensed chromosomes as in prophase and metaphase cells , suggesting that the CARF-compromised cells were arrested at mitosis owing to inhibition of cyclin B1 degradation that normally occurs for mitotic exit and may have thus undergone MC before cell death.16,17 The fact that there was no change in FADD expression after CARF suppression Figure 1e was suggestive that the CARF suppression was not recognized as an external stress . On the other hand , specific activation of mediators of the internal stress response-apoptosis pathway , such as upregulation of Bak pro-apoptotic protein and downregulation of Bcl-2 antiapoptotic protein , were observed Figure 1e suggesting that CARF suppression was recognized as an internal stress response leading to cleavage and activation of caspases 2 , 3 , 7 and 9 . The data suggested that the CARF-silencing-induced apoptosis was mediated predominantly by the mitochondrial� internal stress pathway.18,19 To elucidate the mechanistic processes involved in this phenomenon , we next investigated three major cell stress pathways , including the Ras�MAPK , RB�E2F1 and ATM�ATR�CHK cascades , involved in p53-independent growth arrest and cell death Figure 1f . Ras pathways are activated , but not essential in CARF-silencing-induced cell death . We earlier showed that normal cells undergo stress-induced premature senescence by overexpression of CARF , which is mediated by upregulation of Ras , a small GTPase proto-oncogene activated by receptor tyrosine kinases that regulates cell survival and death pathways.3 We first sought to determine whether the Ras-MAPK pathway is involved in CARF-silencing-induced apoptosis . As shown in Figure 2a , CARF suppression led to downregulation of Ras and inactivation of its downstream effector MAP kinases , extracellular regulated kinases ERK 1 2 the level of phosphorylated ERK1 2 was decreased in CARF-compromised cells . In order to address whether this pathway is critical for CARF-silencing-induced apoptosis , we investigated whether exogenous expression of ERK1 2 could reverse the apoptosis caused by CARF inhibition . As ERK1 and ERK2 are functionally comparable in the regulation of apoptosis , only ERK1-overexpressing U2OS cells were generated . Cells expressing control GFP and GFP-ERK1 proteins were compared for CARF-silencing-induced apoptosis Figure 2b . As shown in Figure 2c and d , cell viability and cleavage of caspase 3 were observed at a similar level in control and ERK1-overexpressing cells , implying that downregulation of the Ras-MAPK signaling was not essential in cell death induced by CARF-suppression . This was further verified by an independent experiment in which we suppressed CARF in HT1080 cells , which harbor Ras overexpression and constitutively active MAPK signaling . HT1080 cells showed a high rate of sponta-neous apoptosis , as supported by caspase 3 cleavage , but suppression of CARF did not cause any further increase in cell death Figure 2e . In order to further investigate and verify the crucial involvement of the MAPK cascade , we recruited MAPK inhibitors . As shown in Figure 2f , HT1080 cells transfected with CARF siRNA were treated with PD98059 , a potent MEK1 2 inhibitor . Cell viability of control and treated cells was the same indicating that the MAPK pathway was not critically involved in CARF-suppression induced apoptosis . Treatment with another MEK1 2 inhibitor , U0126 , generated similar results data not shown . To determine whether the suppression of CARF also involves the other Ras-regulated pathways mediated by PI3K�Akt and p38MAPK , we treated cells transfected with CARF siRNA cells with wortmannin PI3K inhibitor or SB203580 p38MAPK inhibitor . Cell death was induced in an identical manner after both treatments in the CARF-compromised cells Figure 2g , indicating that the various Ras pathways are not critically involved in this cell death process . Control GFP-ERK1 Con . siRNA Con . siRNA 1.2 RB�E2F1 pathway is involved , but not required for CARF silencing-induced cell death . We had earlier shown that premature senescence induced in normal cells by CARF overexpression was associated with increase in RB.3 As the RB�E2F1 pathway modulates apoptosis by p53-independent mechanisms , we investigated if RB has a role in the CARF cell death pathway . As shown in Figure 3a , although total RB protein was not significantly altered after CARF suppression , there were proportional reductions in all phosphorylated forms of RB , including serines 780 , 795 and 807 811 and in E2F1 Figure 3a , signifying growth arrest , which may have ultimately resulted in apoptosis via cleavage of caspase 3 . To determine whether RB is essential for CARF-silencing-induced cell death , we suppressed CARF in RB Saos-2 cells . In contrast to U2OS and HeLa , Saos-2 cells were resistant to CARF-silencing-induced cell death Figure 3b and did not show caspase 3 cleavage or changes in E2F1 , p21WAF1 and CHK1 expression Figure 3c . CARF inhibition was thus , conducted in RB-restored Saos-2 cells to deter-mine whether the cell death phenotype could be reversed . As shown in Figure 3d , HA-tagged RB was restored in Saos-2 cells , however , after CARF suppression , caspase activation was still comparable to non-restored CARF-compromised cells , and no apoptosis was observed Figure 3d and e . Thus , although CARF siRNA-transfected cells were compromised for RB phosphorylation leading to growth arrest , it was not critical for the cell death phenotype . ATM is involved , but not essential for CARF silencing - induced cell death . As CARF was upregulated by DNA damage-inducing stress signals , such as treatment with doxorubicin , etoposide and camptothecin , we considered whether CARF suppression causes genotoxicity leading to apoptotic cell death and examined the effect of CARF suppression on the ATM�ATR pathways , critical regulators of the DNA damage response . As shown in Figure 4a , b and c , CARF-silencing was associated with increases in total and phosphorylated ATM at serine 1981 , as well as gH2AX in both HeLa and U2OS cells suggesting that CARF suppression initiated a DNA damage response . However , total expression of CHK2 , a downstream effector of ATM , did not show any changes and analysis of the phosphorylated forms of CHK2 , including phosphorylation at serine 19 , serines 33 35 and threonine 68 , also did not reveal any alterations between control and CARF-suppressed cells , suggesting that CARF apoptosis is not critically regulated by the ATM pathway Figure 4d . This was further suppor-ted using ATM-deficient cells , FTYZ5 and AT5 BIVA data not shown for the latter . We found that the ATM cells underwent cell death following CARF suppression very similar to ATM ? ? cells Figure 4e . Furthermore , cell death in both ATM and ATM ? ? cells showed cleavage of caspase 3 Figure 4f demonstrating that ATM is not essential for CARF-silencing-induced apoptosis . Suppression of the ATR�CHK1 pathway is a critical factor in CARF-silencing-induced cell death . In contrast to ATM and CHK2 , ATR was suppressed after CARF inhibition in both HeLa and U2OS cells Figure 4a , which was accompanied by decreases in total CHK1 and phospho-CHK1 Figure 4d . To verify that the suppression of this pathway is a critical factor in CARF-inhibition-induced cell death , GFP-CHK1 was transiently overexpressed Figure 5a and then subjected to CARF suppression . As shown in Figure 5b , although cell death was still observed in the control vector cells following CARF suppression , cell viability was maintained in the cells with CHK1 overexpression . Further , cyclin B1 and histone H3 the major markers of MC , as well as gH2AX , which showed increases in control CARF-compromised cells Figures 1c and 5c , were normalized in the CHK1-overexpressing , CARF-compromised cells Figure 5c and d . Immunofluorescent staining showed that CARF siRNA transfection effectively decreased CARF expression Figure 5d . Cyclin B1 was found predominately in the cytoplasm of cells and gH2AX foci were very rare in the control cells Figure 5e and f , 1st and 3rd columns . In the CARF-compromised control vector cells , nuclear cyclin B1 and gH2AX showed accumulation Figure 5e and f , 2nd column . In contrast , the CHK1-overexpressing cells did not accumulate cyclin B1 and gH2AX after CARF suppression Figure 5e and f , 4th column . Noticeably , cells that lacked CHK1 expression as evidenced by lack of GFP signal , white arrowheads , accumulated nuclear cyclin B1 and gH2AX after CARF suppression while CHK1-overexpressing cells did not yellow arrows . These results were also seen in HeLa cells data not shown . We further confirmed that CHK1 overexpression reverted the apoptosis in CARF-compromised cells by investigating the activation of caspases , as well as by TUNEL staining Figure 5g and h . We observed increased cleavage of caspase 9 in the control U2OS cells following CARF knockdown , as shown previously , however , this cleavage was normalized in the CHK1-overexpressing cells Figure 5g . Consistent with apoptosis , caspase 3 activity was substantially increased in control U2OS , but not in CHK1-overexpressing cells after CARF knockdown Figure 5h . TUNEL staining also revealed increased apoptosis in the control U2OS cells following CARF knockdown and a reversion of this phenotype in the CHK1-overexpressing cells Figure 5i . In order to determine the mechanism by which CARF regulates CHK1 , we performed reverse-transcription PCR to observe the transcriptional status of CHK1 following CARF knockdown . We found that CHK1 was significantly down-regulated in the CARF-compromised cells , suggesting that CARF is a transcriptional regulator of CHK1 . Thus , we conclude here that suppression of CARF resulted in downregulation of the ATR�CHK1 pathway via transcrip-tional repression of CHK1 expression , leading to MC and apoptosis , and exogenous upregulation of CHK1 reverted the cell death phenotype Figure 6 . CARF targeting causes tumor suppression in vivo . As described above , siRNA-mediated CARF suppression induced apoptosis in cultured cancer cells implicating its antitumor potential . To verify whether the suppression of CARF is antitumoral in vivo , we used A549 cells a lung carcinoma with wildtype p53 , RB and ATR�CHK1 pathways in a human tumor xenograft nude mouse model . In order to achieve stable suppression of CARF expression , we used adenovirus as a carrier . We introduced CARF shRNA shCARF under the control of a U6 promoter in the E3 region of an E1A-mutated and E1B-deleted adenovirus , Ad-DB7 , generating Ad-DB7-shCARF . Relative efficacy of the virus infection and cytotoxicity were compared with the ATM+ + ATM -- control vectors in in vitro cytotoxicity assays Figure 7a . We found that the CARF-targeting adenovirus evoked a cytotoxic response in A549 cells even at multiplicities of infection MOI 0.2 it was about threefold more potent than the control carrier DB7 . Oncolytic control and CARF-targeting adenoviruses were examined for their ability to suppress the growth of A549 xenografts established in nude mice . When the subcutaneously implanted A549 tumors reached U2OS WT U2OS+CHK1 Control CARF siRNA Control CARF siRNA approximately 100 mm3 in volume , tumors were randomized and treated with phosphate-buffered saline PBS , Ad-DB7 or Ad-DB7-shCARF thrice daily on alternate days . Daily observations on tumor volume , body weight and general activity were continued until the experiment was terminated at 50 days . As early as 3 days of treatment , there was a regression in the size of the tumors in the shCARF group Figure 7b , gray circles . Although there was a cytotoxic effect from the adenovirus carrier , beginning from day 20 of treatment , tumors of the shCARF group continued to regress while tumors of the Ad-DB7 control group began to enlarge in size . By day 50 , in comparison to the PBS-treated control tumors average tumor volume 692.6 mm3 , Ad-DB7 treated group showed B61 % reduction in tumor size average tumor volume 267.9 mm3 . The cytotoxic effect was much more pronounced average tumor volume 73.3 mm3 implicating B89 % reduction in tumor growth with CARF-targeting adenoviruses , Ad-DB7-shCARF . Furthermore , CARF-targeting adenovirus significantly averted mortality related to large tumor size . Although all the PBS control mice died by day 35 and 50 % of the Ad-DB7 control group died by the end of the experiment , all the Ad-DB7-shCARF mice were alive with no or very small tumors by day 50 Figure 7c . We observed no marked treatment-related toxicities affecting feeding , activity or body weight of mice . These data confirmed that our CARF-targeting strategy caused tumor Hoechst suppression in vivo and , hence , shCARF is a potential antitumor reagent either by itself or in concert with adeno-oncolytic viruses . We had previously found that CARF , a novel p53-regulatory protein , can dose-dependently induce senescence overexpres-sion and apoptosis downregulation .20 In this report , we elucidated the mechanisms that regulated the apoptotic process following CARF inhibition . We show here that , CARF is a pleiotropic protein that not only mediates p53 and its related pathways , but also synergizes with multiple signaling cascades including the ATM�ATR , Ras�MAPK and RB pathways responsible for cell survival and cell death . As shown in Figure 1 , we found that the apoptotic program is , through MC , mediated by activation of the mitochondrial�internal stress and caspase pathways including upregulation of Bak pro-apoptotic protein , downregulation of Bcl-2 antiapoptotic protein and activation of caspases 9 , 7 , 2 and 3 . Genome integrity is the basis for proper cell growth , proliferation and survival , and loss of genome integrity may result either in cell death or arrest to prevent growth of abnormal cells or tumorigenesis.21 It has been established that genotoxic stress or checkpoint abrogation through CHK1 inhibition can lead to MC and caspase-dependent apoptosis for which cyclin B1 accumulation is a biomarker.22,23 We found that CARF suppression downregulated the essential genome safeguards , ATR and CHK1 , which led to DNA damage as evidenced by increased gH2AX Figure 5a and c . This appeared to be the primary cause of DNA damage in CARF-compromised cells , as overexpression of CHK1 in CARF-compromised cells reverted not only the cell death phenotype , butalsoabolishedtheinductionof gH2AX Figure5 . The significance of ATR and CHK1 in maintaining genome integrity has been shown by other studies , in which exogenous suppression of this pathway leads to formation of single-stranded DNA , DNA breaks and telomere instability , and complete knockout of ATR or CHK1 is embryonic lethal.24,25 CHK1 may also function downstream of ATM , but after CARF inhibition , ATM was upregulated and activated as evidenced by phosphorylation at serine 1981 , although CHK2 was not activated and CARF knockdown in ATM deficient cells did not alter the cell fate Figures 5 and 6 . The data suggest that CARF knockdown induced genotoxicity and severely stunted the DNA damage response . As CHK1 inhibitors are currently being developed as adjuvants to enhance the efficacy of genotoxic antitumor agents , our results suggest that CARF may also be useful as a therapeutic reagent . size Tumor 300 120 100 % 80 viability 60 Animal 40 CARF suppression and the subsequent DNA damage also affected the Ras�MAPK and RB�E2F1 pathways seemingly to induce cell cycle arrest , but the reconstitution of these factors following CARF inhibition did not protect the cells against CARF-silencing-induced apoptosis . The quintessen-tial MAPK pathway is crucial in organismal development , having pivotal roles in cell survival , proliferation , differentiation and death pathways.8 This pathway consists of three major groups the ERKs , stress-activated protein kinase c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase and p38MAPK . Ras , a key upstream player in this pathway , can invoke both cellular proliferation , as observed by neoplastic activity via oncogenic Ras activation and subsequent MAPK or phosphoinositide 3-kinases PI3-K transduction and cell death . Further , MAPK are known to participate in the maintenance of G2 M arrest and they are required for exit from growth arrest and transition through mitosis.26 In our previous study , we had found that Ras can induce CARF , and we show here that CARF inhibition reciprocally decreases Ras , leading to downregulation of the Ras-mediated MAPK pathway , possibly as a measure to halt the cell cycle . Nonetheless , using two independent assays including ERK-overexpressing and HT1080 cells , we found that the Ras�MAPK pathway is not essential for CARF-inhibition-induced apoptosis . In contrast , we show that CHK1 levels remained the same in control and CARF-siRNA treated HT1080 cells Figure 2e , which suggested that CHK1 has a role in preventing cell death in these cells . Similarly , RB�E2F1 pathway , another important pathway in regulation of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis was not critically involved in CARF siRNA-involved cell death . Cell cycle pro-gression requires phosphorylation of RB by cyclin-dependent kinases and their partner cyclins to free E2F proteins and subsequent transactivation of a plethora of cell cycle regulat-ing genes.6 Hypophosphorylated RB binds to and inhibits the activity of E2F proteins , leading to suppression of a variety of genes including those required for cell cycle progression . Further , RB and E2F proteins have been implicated in regulation of apoptosis , wherein , hypophosphorylated RB binds to E2F1 , leading to growth arrest followed by apopto-sis.27,28 Proper RB function is required for maintenance of G2 M arrest following DNA damage and disruption of RB accelerated G2 M progression in the presence of DNA damage by elevating E2F activity and the expression of a mitotic regulatory genes.29 Our results demonstrated that CARF suppression led to hypophosphorylated RB and downregulation of E2F1 , suggesting that CARF inhibition may also activate this pathway to bring about growth arrest . However , although Saos-2 cells , which lack RB , were resistant to CARF-inhibition induced cell death , restoration of RB to Saos-2 did not revert the phenotype , which indicated that RB is not sufficient to revert the apoptosis induced by CARF suppression . On the other hand , CHK1 expression was identical between control and CARF siRNA-treated Saos-2 cells Figure 3c and d , suggesting that in Saos-2 , similar to those in HT1080 cells , the retention of CHK1 levels prevented the apoptotic phenotype as seen in the other cell lines with downregulated CHK1 . The data suggested that the primary effect of CARF suppression is loss of DNA protection and induction of DNA damage owing to downregulation of the ATR�CHK1 pathway through transcriptional repression of the CHK1 gene , leading to induction of mitotic arrest and cell death . We show that CARF is an essential genome safeguard that critically regulates the ATR�CHK1 pathway and its inhibition induces cell death via ATR�CHK1 dysregulation that also involves the Ras-MAPK , ATM�CHK2 and RB�E2F1 pathways Figure 6 . These results highlight the pleiotropic effects of CARF as its knockdown impinges upon multiple pathways and its potential as a novel therapeutic reagent . Furthermore , in vivo suppression of tumoral CARF com-pletely abrogated tumor growth leading to 100 % animal survival , providing evidence that CARF is a strong anticancer therapeutic target Figure 7 . Our in vivo strategy involved using oncolytic adenovirus to carry shCARF directly to tumors , which caused complete tumor regression , and viability of the animals was preserved as compared with the vehicle controls . Infection of tumor cells with adenoviruses induces an immune response which enhances the recognition of tumor antigens.30 However , a high infective dose may cause acute cytotoxicity . To circumvent this , generation of mutant adenoviruses with enhanced specificity to tumor cells to decrease side effects and increase efficacy has been developed . Adenovirus carrying the E1B7 deletion Ad-DB7 has been shown to markedly increase oncolysis and apoptosis , potentiating its development as a novel anticancer therapy , but its tumor-targeting effect is still considered mild , thus , it may be more effective as an adjuvant treatment.31 Previously , adenovirus with E1 deletions exhibited enhanced efficacy and tumorilytic activities when administered in conju-nction with radiotherapy or chemotherapeutic drugs.32,33 Alternatively , using the mutant adenovirus as anticancer gene carriers had also demonstrated increased oncolytic efficacy.34 Thus , in our study , we utilized Ad-DB7 as a gene carrier for shCARF . Although Ad-DB7 alone showed a moderate degree of oncolysis and inhibition of tumor growth , by 21 days of treatment , tumor growth resumed followed by animal mortality presumably owing to the increase in tumor burden Figure 7 . In contrast , Ad-DB7-shCARF showed tumor regression throughout the experimental period and complete preserva-tion of animal viability . This demonstrated that CARF suppression might be a safe and effective antitumor reagent in conjunction with oncolytic adenovirus administration with no observed side effects such as cytotoxicity .

Adenoviruses were chosen to carry shRNA against CARF as an in vivo carrier because of their enhanced oncolytic ability and safety.33 We introduced shCARF , the sequences of which are identical to the CARF siRNA described above , under the control of an U6 promoter in the E3 region of an E1A-mutated and E1B-deleted adenovirus , Ad-DB7 , generating Ad-DB7-shCARF .
