19763139	Review D Boison* , 1 , J-F Chen2 and BB Fredholm3 It is becoming increasingly clear that inflammatory processes play an important role in neurodegenerative disease , just as inflammation is becoming increasingly implicated in various systemic diseases elsewhere in the body.1 As the immune responses in brain show uncommon features , it was long considered to be �immune privileged� . However , cells that are involved in adaptive immune reactions do enter the brain , and this can result in major CNS pathology . Multiple sclerosis is an important example . Furthermore , immune reactions , often attributable to the innate immune system , feature in many , if not all , neurodegenerative diseases . Microglial cells , astro-cytes , endothelial cells , oligodendrocytes , and neurons all produce signals to orchestrate these reactions . Arachidonic acid metabolites , nitric oxide , cytokines , and chemokines all appear to play some role . Recently , the role of ATP and adenosine as critically important signaling molecules has become appreciated.2,3 This awareness that a multiplicity of signals other than those principally involved in nerve�nerve communication play a role in neurodegenerative disease has also meant that we have to consider other cells than neurons as critically important players . The present brief review will focus on adenosine and to a lesser extent ATP signaling , and the role of glial cells in neurodegenerative disease . The review will feature results from the authors� own work more prominently than would be motivated from an objective standpoint . www.nature.com cdd Glial Control of Adenosine Homeostasis In mammals , purine de novo synthesis proceeds via formation of IMP , which is then converted into AMP however , there is no de novo synthesis pathway for adenosine . Physiologically , intracellular adenosine can be formed by either dephos-phorylation of AMP by 50-nucleotidase , or , alternatively , by hydrolysis of S-adenosylhomocysteine , whereas extracellular adenosine can be formed from released adenine nucleotides by a cascade of ectonucleotidases.4 Two metabolic pathways are responsible for the removal of adenosine deamination into inosine via adenosine deaminase ADA EC 3.5.4.4 and phosphorylation into AMP via adenosine kinase ADK EC 2.7.1.20 . Based on its low KM for adenosine , ADK is considered to be the primary route of adenosine metabolism.5 Recent findings indicate that extracellular levels of adenosine , and consequently the levels close to synapses , are largely regulated by astrocytes , 6�10 and an astrocyte-based adeno-sine cycle has been proposed.11,12 Glial release of ATP as source for extracellular adenosine . ATP can be released from neurons and astrocytes , is identified as a neurotransmitter in both CNS and PNS , and exerts a multitude of largely excitatory effects by activation of specific ATP receptors P2X and P2Y receptors .13 Vesicular release has also been clearly demonstrated from endocrine cells , and here release of ATP may differ in several ways from that of the hormone , because of so-called kiss-and-run release.14 Thus , ATP can be released even in situations when the vesicle fusion is too incomplete and transient to allow release of the stored hormone . Perhaps this can occur also in nerves . However , under physiological conditions the vesicular release of ATP , not from neurons , but from astrocytes , has been identified as a major source of synaptic adenosine.15 Transgenic mice that express a dominant-negative soluble NSF attachment protein SNARE domain selectively in astrocytes were characterized by the loss of the adenosine A1 receptor-mediated tonic inhibition in synaptic slices , indicating that under physiological conditions astrocytic release of ATP followed by degradation into adenosine via ectonucleo-tidases is a major source of adenosine15 that affects synaptic transmission . A kiss-and-run-like exocytotic release of ATP has been detected in astrocytes.16 Another , possibly related , mechanism involves release of ATP from a lysosome pool in astrocytes.17 However , astrocytes appear to use also other mechanisms to release ATP as a signal . One of those involve connexin hemichannels , 18 but recent work provides strong reason to assume that pannexin-1 , rather than connexin-43 , provides the most responsible channel.19 Another proposal is that ATP is released via maxi-anion channels , and this may be particularly important in astrocytic swelling.20 The P2X7 receptor may in some conformations allow ATP to be released . Finally , ATP may be released whenever there are increases in membrane volume via incorporation of intracellular vesicles into the membrane , or when there is a shedding of small vesicles.21 In addition to the mechanisms described above , astrocytes can directly release adenosine , especially in response to hypoxic stimulation , 6,22 even though release of adenosine per se is more typical of neurons.23 In that case the release depends on export of adenosine via the equilibrative nucleoside transporters . Since astrocytes can contact thousands of synapses and coordinate synaptic networks , 8,24 it is conceivable that astrocytic release of ATP and its subsequent degradation into adenosine has a major regulatory function in setting a global adenosine-mediated inhibitory tone within a neuronal net-work . In addition , other glial cells can also contribute . For example , in retinal tissue , stimulation of glial cells leads to an adenosine-mediated inhibition of neuronal activity , but in this case Muller cells rather than astrocytes appear to be most important.25 The distribution of adenosine formed from breakdown of released ATP will obviously also depend on the distribution of the enzymes that degrade the nucleotide . It was shown long ago that 50nucleotidase tended to accumulate in areas of a lesion , 26 and we now know that CD73 , the ecto-50nucleotidase , is highly expressed in microglial cells , as is the ecto-NTPDase nucleoside triphosphate diphospho-hydrolase , CD39.27 Elimination of adenosine via astrocytic adenosine kinase . Several lines of evidence indicate that astrocytic ADK is the key regulator for ambient levels of adenosine i In adult brain , ADK is predominantly expressed in astrocytes 10 ii pharmacological inhibition of ADK is sufficient to prevent seizures in various models of epilepsy 28 iii genetic knockout or knockdown of ADK in cultured cells induces secretion of adenosine into the medium 29�32 iv transgenic overexpression of ADK triggers seizures by reduction of ambient adenosine 33 v inhibition of ADK in hippocampal slices increases endogenous adenosine and depresses neuronal firing , whereas inhibition of ADA had no effect 34 vi a substrate cycle between AMP and adenosine , which involves ADK and 50-nucleotidase , enables minor changes in ADK activity to rapidly translate into major changes in adenosine and35 vii ADK activity is regulated in response to brain injury and is subject to developmental regulation.10,36,37 Based on these considerations , and based on the lack of a classical transporter-regulated reuptake system for adenosine and the ubiquitous presence of bidirectional equilibrative nucleoside transporters , 38 ADK likely fulfills the role of a metabolic reuptake system for adenosine . Thus , tight regulation of ADK expression levels and of its specific activity becomes a necessity . Therefore , it is not surprising that ADK is highly conserved in evolution , that no naturally occurring mutations of the Adk gene are known , and that a genetic disruption of the Adk gene is lethal.5,39 The fact that astrocytic ADK is of critical importance in regulating extracellular adenosine concentrations implies that the nucleoside transporters that facilitate adenosine uptake into astrocytes are important . Astrocytes express one concentrating sodium dependent and two equilibrative nucleoside transporters.40 Inhibition of this transport could potentially be used to elevate brain adenosine levels under conditions where extracellular adenosine is derived from extracellular ATP , but they would be less useful under conditions when adenosine is derived from intracellular production.41 It is interesting to note that cannabinoids can block the equilibrative transporter and this effect can partly explain the immunosuppressive effects of these com-pounds.42 The central role of astrocytes in regulating extracellular levels of adenosine is demonstrated in Figure 1 . Glial Adenosine Receptors There are four types of evolutionarily conserved and pharmacologically well-characterized adenosine receptors ARs called A1 , A2A , A2B , and A343 Figure 2 . Adenosine is the endogenous agonist at all these receptors , but at A1 and A3 receptors inosine can act as a partial agonist.44,45 The A1 and A3 receptors couple to the Gi family of G proteins and , thus , stimulate K ? channels , reduce transient voltage-dependent Ca2 ? channels , and inhibit cAMP formation A2A receptors couple to members of the Gs family Golf in striatal neurons , whereas A2B receptors couple to many G proteins including Gs , Gq , and G12 . Adenosine is approximately equipotent on A1 , A2A , and A3 receptors , whereas A2B receptors require higher agonist concentrations , if cAMP changes is the readout , 45 but if microtubule associated protein MAP kinase activation is used to measure receptor activa-tion adenosine is virtually equipotent on all four receptors.46 All four ARs are detected in astrocytes , 22 and all have been reported to be expressed in microglial cells or microglial cell lines.47�49 A1 receptors . A1 receptors on astrocytes reduce their proliferation rate in culture.50 As in many other types of cells , activation of A1 receptors can not only decrease cAMP accumulation but also stimulate phospholipase C , especially if this pathway is simultaneously activated by other stimuli.51�53 A1 receptors help protect astrocytes from damage and cell death , 22,54,55 partly via activation of PI3K and Erk 1 2 phosphorylation . Nerve activity promotes myelination and it has been shown that this response is dependent on ATP , 56 but ATP acts on oligodendrocytes indirectly , because ATP acts on astrocytes to release leukemia inhibitory factor . This response may be modified by adenosine , as A1 receptors are present in oligodendroglia57 and stimulate their migration . It has been shown that A1 receptor activation leads to white matter loss , and that A1 receptors contribute to hypoxia-induced white matter loss.58 A1 receptors on microglial cells are reported to reduce excessive activation of microglial cells upon immune activation.59 Activation of these microglial receptors may secondarily affect oligodendroglial cells59 and also astrocyte proliferation , 60 which emphasizes the possibility of an extended glial network of signaling . A1 receptors on neurons especially at nerve terminals are critically important in mediating the dampening effect on neuronal activity mediated by adenosine generated from ATP released from astro-cytes.6,61 The highly abundant A1 receptors at nerve endings may preferentially signal via Go proteins to inhibit transient calcium channels , whereas the same receptors in nerve cell bodies and dendrites may preferentially regulate potassium channel conductance via G1 proteins . A2A receptors . In brain , A2ARs are expressed at high levels in striatal neurons and at low levels in neurons outside of the striatum and in glial cells.62,63 Many functional measure-ments such as cAMP levels and cytokine release coupled with pharmacological tools have clearly demonstrated the presence and function of A2ARs in glial cells.64 A2AR binding densities are at the range B30�60 fmole mg protein in primary cultured microglial cells or in sorted microglial cells derived from striatum , as estimated by 3H-ligand binding studies.65,66 Furthermore , the expression of the A2AR in glial elements in both the striatum and the solitary tract is confirmed by electronmicroscopic studies.63,67 It should be noted that A2AR expression in microglia and astrocytes is usually low under physiological conditions and frequently below the detection limit of histological methods i.e. , immunohistochemistry , autoradiography , or in situ hybridization .62,64,68 Importantly , expression of A2ARs in glial cells is induced following brain insults . For example , LPS treatment induced A2AR mRNA and protein in primary cultures of mixed glial cells mainly in microglial cells at 16 h and peaked at 48 h after the treatment.65 Recently , using double immunohisto-chemistry analysis , we demonstrated that A2AR expression is induced in microglial cells and astrocytes of mouse substantia nigra at 24 h after 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyri-dine MPTP intoxication . The induction of A2ARs in glial cells by brain insults and inflammatory signals , coupled with local increase in adenosine and proinflammatory cytokine levels such as IL-1b , which further induces A2AR expression , may serve as part of an important feed-forward mechanism to locally control neuroinflammatory responses in the brain . It has been shown that adenosine , acting on A2A receptors , can increase extracellular levels of glutamate , both by reducing glutamate uptake via GLT-1 and by direct release.69,70 Thus , some of the reported effects of A2A receptors on glutamate release may be based on mechanisms mediated by astro-cytes rather than by neurons . A2ARs in glial cells may exert complex actions on neuronal cell death both , potentially deleterious as well as neuro-protective and possibly other functions such as modulation of synaptic transmission . In astrocytes , activation of A2ARs by extracellular adenosine increases astrocyte proliferation and activation , 71,72 but inhibits the expression of iNOS and the production of NO , 73 and regulates glutamate efflux by astrocytes.69 Thus , modulation of astrogliosis by A2ARs is likely involved in brain repair processes , possibly via formation of tissue scar . In microglial cells , activation of A2ARs has mixed effects on microglial proliferation , but has clear facilitating effects on the release of cytokines , including upregulation of cyclooxygenase 2 and release of prostaglan-din E2 PGE2 , 74 and on increases in nitric oxide synthase NOS activity and NO release65 and nerve growth factor expression.75 A2B receptors . It was shown early on that cyclic AMP accumulation in brain slices was due to an AR different than that responsible for adenylate cyclase stimulation in striatum , and it is now clear that a major part of the brain slice cAMP response is due to A2B receptor activation on astrocytes.76 A2B receptors can couple with two different classes of G proteins , Gq and Gs . Gq regulates intracellular calcium and vesicular release , whereas Gs affects a plethora of cAMP-dependent signaling pathways . The A2B receptor may also activate phospholipase C77 and appears to be responsible for the adenosine-induced stimulation of IL-6 from astrocytes.78 In airways , A2B receptors , via cAMP , regulate chloride channels.79 Since this occurs also in the intestine , it is fair to predict that cells in the CNS likewise alter chloride flux via A2BR signaling . In particular , the possibility exists that adenosine is an important regulator of astrocytic swelling via modulation of volume-regulated anion channels . A2B receptors may also play an important role in the development of the nervous system it was intially proposed that the important regulator , netrin , required signaling via A2B receptors , 80 but later studies showed that netrin does not require simulataneous A2BR signaling , 81 but that netrin signaling requires prior A2B activation because the receptor is thereby regulated.82 A3 receptors . Astrocytic A3 receptors appear to regulate chemokine release.83 Activation of A3 receptors by endogenous adenosine protects astrocytes from cell death induced , for example , by hypoxia.22 Microglial cells have functional A3 receptors coupled to MSAP kinase and p38 signaling.47,84 Although adenosine itself has little effect on microglial migration , it was shown that migration induced by ATP , 85 perhaps predominantly via P2Y12 receptors , 86 is lost when ATP hydrolysis via CD39 is eliminated , and can be restored by adenosine.27 Although it is not absolutely certain that the relevant AR is the A3R , it is tempting to speculate that there is a similarity to the situation in neutrophil leucocytes where ATP acting on a P2Y receptor acts in concert with adenosine acting on A3 receptors to stimulate migration.87 Microglial cells and A3 receptors may also be of particular importance in the regulation of chemokine release and chemokine actions.88 Glial Cells and Neurovascular Coupling Glial cells play important roles in coupling neuronal function to the cerebral microvasculature that controls cerebral blood flow CBF , 89,90 in the sense that increased neuronal activity requires corresponding increases in CBF . Apart from large processes that stain for intermediate filaments and give astrocytes their stellar appearance , astrocytes have a multi-tude of fine processes that have little overlap with processes from other astrocytes and that define individual astrocytic domains , which each contain 300�600 neuronal dendrites and 105 synapses in rodent hippocampus.8,91�93 Thus , a single astrocyte can sense the activity , and integrate the function , of hundreds of neurons within its domain . In addition , each astrocyte extends at least one process with endfeet surrounding blood vessels of the microvasculature . There-fore , astrocytes are uniquely located to adjust regional CBF to regional energy metabolism . The vasodilator adenosine has been identified as an important mediator that couples CBF to neuronal activation.94 Thus , adenosine was demonstrated to mediate glutamate-induced vasodilation in the cerebral cortex.95,96 Topical application of glutamate dilated pial arterioles , an effect that could be reversed by an A2AR antagonist , but not by an A2AR antagonist.95 Likewise topical superfusion AMPA on the cortical surface through a closed cranial window resulted in increases in pial arteriolar diameter , an effect that could be reversed by A2A and A2BR blockade , but not by inhibition of NO synthase , cyclooxygenase-2 , or cytochrome P-450 epoxygenase.96 Apart from the activation of vascular ARs , adenosine can exert important regulatory functions by activation of astrocytic ARs.97 Thus , the adenosine-evoked calcium response in acutely isolated astrocytes was found to be coupled to the A2B receptor 77 based on these findings adenosine could be implicated in promoting the propagation of calcium increases throughout astrocytic processes . In-creased Ca2 ? in turn is also associated with the release of ATP through connexin hemichannels , a process that is potentiated by A2BR activation.98,99 Through these mechan-isms ATP release and degradation into adenosine via ectonucleotidases appears to mediate arteriolar dilation in response to neuronal activation.100 This process was depen-dent on astrocytes , since application of the selective gliotoxin , L-AAA , led to complete loss of arteriolar dilation in response to neuronal activation.101 Glial Control of Glutamate and Excitotoxicity Astrocytes play a fundamental role in the pathogenesis of ischemic neuronal death.102 A large body of evidence indicates that astrocytes are involved in the control of glutamate homeostasis and susceptibility of the brain to excitotoxic injury.103 Glutamate transporters are expressed in many different types of brain cells , but astrocytes are primarily responsible for glutamate uptake . Studies using genetic deletion or antisense oligonucleotides-mediated knockdown of the astroglial glutamate transporter GLT-1 have demon-strated that this transporter is the predominant subtype responsible for the clearance of extracellular glutamate in the brain.104,105 Affected animals were highly susceptible to glutamate-dependent excitotoxicity and developed epileptic seizures.104,105 After uptake of glutamate into astrocytes , the enzyme glutamine synthetase converts glutamate into gluta-mine , which is then transported into neurons where it is converted back into glutamate . Interestingly , a loss of glutamine synthetase was found in the sclerotic hippocampus of human patients with temporal lobe epilepsy106 and the authors of that study concluded that reduced activity of the glutamate�glutamine cycle led to accumulation of extra-cellular glutamate . Apart from the mechanisms described above , astrocytes themselves can be a significant source of extracellular glutamate , which can be released by a variety of mechan-isms.107 It has been demonstrated that Ca2 ? elevations in astrocytes induce the excitotoxic release of glutamate from these cells.108 Most importantly , the Ca2 ? -dependent astrocytic release of glutamate was also dependent on the vesicular glutamate transporters VGLUT1 2 and the vesi-cular SNARE protein , cellubrevin , and was consistent with a vesicular release mechanism of glutamate that was similar to synaptic release of glutamate.108 Finally , it was shown that astrocyte-derived glutamate targets synaptic N-methyl-D-aspartic acid NMDA receptors , 109 providing a rational explanation for the astrocyte-based control of neurotoxicity . Given the emerging roles of astrocytes in the control of neuronal excitotoxicity , neuroprotective efforts targeting the functional integrity of astrocytes may constitute a superior strategy for future neuroprotection . Novel Methods for Studying the Role of Glia Co-culture of glia and neurons . Many original insights into gliotransmission were discovered using co-culture systems and then extended to brain slices or the intact brain . For example , the first evidence for gliotransmission came from studies of mixed cultures of astrocytes and neurons demonstrating that experimentally evoked Ca2 ? elevation in astrocytes evoked elevation of Ca2 ? in adjacent neurons.110,111 In this method , cultured cells from postnatal day 1�4 rodent brain are first enriched with one population of either glial or neuronal origin using specific culture conditions and then confirmed by immunohistochemistry. Glial or neuronal cells are then plated separately or together onto a coated substrate . The distinct morphology of glial cells and neurons allows identification of these distinct cell types and permits direct application of electric field potentials , micropipette tips , or neurochemical substrates to astrocytes in order to evoke a specific elevation of calcium in glial cells e.g. , in astrocytes .110,111 The spatiotemporal control over mechanical stimuli has permitted the selective stimulation of single astrocytes in mixed cultures of rat forebrain astrocytes and neurons . Using this strategy it was demonstrated that the elevation of calcium , triggered by focal electric field potentials in single astrocytes , induced a wave of calcium increase that was propagated from astrocyte to astrocyte , and importantly , this wave of calcium increase also evoked large increases in the concentration of cytosolic calcium in neurons depending on those astrocytes.110,111 More recently , mixed co-cultures in multi-compartment dishes were equipped with the capability to provide electronic stimuli selectively to neurons in mixed cultures of oligodendrocytes and dorsal root ganglion neurons . This approach led to the finding that ATP and adenosine , released from neurons , act as potent neuron�glial transmitters that inhibited oligodendrocyte progenitor cell proliferation , stimulated their differentiation , and promoted the formation of myelin.56,112 Transgenic overexpression and targeted knockout of genes in defined glial populations . Glial cells have been shown to release gliotransmitters , including ATP , 9,17 glutamate , 111,113 and D-serine , 114 to coordinate synaptic networks . However , neurons and glia share these same chemical signaling molecules , making it difficult to define the role of gliotransmitters . To molecularly dissect the role of glial signaling molecules , genetic approaches have been developed to selectively manipulate the SNARE-dependent release of gliotransmitters using a glia-specific promoter . Pascual and Haydon developed a transgenic mouse line , which uses the tet-off system to allow conditional expression of the cytosolic portion of the SNARE domain of synptobrevin-2 [ dominant-negative SNARE dn-SNARE ] selectively in astrocytes.15 The selective expression of dn-SNARE was achieved by the use of an astrocyte-specific glial fibrillary acid protein promoter . To confirm the cell type selectivity of astrocytic transgene expression , Pascual and co-workers used enhanced green fluorescent protein EGFP as a reporter system and showed that EGFP was visually detectable in 97 % of the dn-SNARE-transgene-expressing cultured astrocytes , and that EGFP-positive cells colocalized specifically with the astrocytic marker , but not with neuronal , NG2�glial , or oligodendroglial markers . This transgenic line has been used successfully to demonstrate the functional significance of gliotransmission on synaptic plasticity in hippocampus , 15 and more recently in the sleep-wake cycle.61 Similarly , transgenic overexpression of a mutant disease-causing gene in a defined glial cell population has been used to study the role of superoxide dismutase-1 SOD1 in astrocytes in the development of motor neuron death . Nagai et al.115 demonstrated that the astrocyte-selective expression of mutant human SOD1 but not in spinal motor neurons , microglia or fibroblasts killed spinal primary and embryonic mouse stem cell-derived motor neurons . As a complementary genetic approach , the selective deletion of signaling molecules in defined glial cell populations can be accomplished using the Cre-loxP strategy . For example , Boillee et al.116 generated a transgenic line LoxSOD1G37R that carried a mutant human SOD1 gene flanked at both ends by a 34-bp LoxP sequence . These �floxed� mice were then cross-bred to two transgenic lines with expression of the Cre protein under control of i the promoter from the Islet-1 transcription factor , which directs the expression exclusively in progenitors of motor and dorsal root ganglion neurons , and ii the CD11b promoter , which directs the expression exclusively in the myeloid lineage including macrophages and microglial cells . The establish-ment of these two novel transgenic lines allowed to demonstrate that the SOD1 mutation in motor neurons and microglial cells contributes distinctly to the onset and progression of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis whereas expres-sion of SOD1 in motor neurons is the primary signal for the initiation of motor neurodegeneration and an early sign of disease progression , the genetic inactivation of SOD in microglial cells had little effect on the early disease phase , but markedly attenuated disease progression.116 Thus , these genetic approaches to selectively manipulate signaling molecules in defined glial or neuronal populations provide critical insights into the distinct role of glial cells in the development of neurodegeneration . Flow cytometric analysis and FACS . The structural complexity of brain tissues hampers the dissection of unique roles of glial cells under various physiological and pathological conditions . Glial cells are characterized by a unique morphology , which permits distinction of neuronal versus glial cells in intact brain by immunohistochemistry . However , it is difficult to quantify immunohistochemical changes without performing labor-intensive stereological analysis . Furthermore , there is a critical need to isolate large numbers of pure glial cells from intact brain for detailed molecular analysis such as qPCR and microarray analysis . Flow cytometric and fluorescence-activated cell sorting FACS can be adapted to partially circumvent these limitations for the study of glial cell functions in brain . In the first application , defined glial cell populations such astrocytes , microglia , or oligodendrocytes are identified by labeling with a fluorescent antibody directed against specific cell-surface markers . Quantitative changes of glial popula-tions in normal and injured brains are determined by flow cytometry . For example , we recently used this analysis to evaluate the change of CD11b ? a cell-surface marker for microglial cells and GFAP ? a maker for astrocytes cells in mouse striatum after treatment with MPTP and the A2AR antagonist KW6002.117 This analysis not only provided an improved quantitative assessment of the effect of the A2AR antagonist on microglial activation at the very early phase of MPTP intoxication , but also identified a specific microglial cell population i.e. , CD11b ? cells with a large cell size representing fully activated microglial cells , which are most sensitive to KW6002 treatment in the brain.117 In the second application , FACS permits isolation and purification of distinct populations of glial cells from neurons from brain tissues using fluorescent antibodies directed against cell-surface markers . The sorted glial cell populations can then be used for detailed molecular analyses such as quantitative PCR and microarray analysis . For example , Lovatt et al.118 successfully performed microarray profiling of sorted astrocytes from mouse cortex using FACS and surprisingly demonstrated that most enzymes in the tricarboxylic acid cycle are expressed at higher relative levels in astrocytes than in neurons . Adenosine Signaling in Glial Cells , Excitotoxicity , and Cell Death As outlined above , synaptic levels of adenosine are largely controlled by an astrocyte-based adenosine cycle and the activity of the astrocyte-based enzyme ADK . Consequently , adenosine signaling in glial cells effects excitotoxicity and cell death in a variety of experimental paradigms . In addition , several forms of brain insult activate microglial cells . Here , ATP release is critically important , 85 but the ATP response in microglial cells is markedly enhanced by adenosine gener-ated from ATP.27 Epilepsy . The adenosine kinase hypothesis of epilepto-genesis implies that dysregulation of ADK is a major contributing factor to the epileptogenic cascade12 Figure 3 . Consequently , ADK expression levels that determine levels of ambient adenosine determine the brain�s susceptibility to acute seizure-induced cell death . Mice with only moderate transgenic overexpression of ADK in the brain 141 % of normal were highly susceptible to acute seizure-induced cell death and did not survive beyond 3 days following status epilepticus , 37 whereas engineered mice with reduced levels of ADK in the forebrain 62 % of normal were completely resistant to seizure-induced cell death.37 Resistance to seizure-induced excitotoxic cell death in ADK-deficient mice was dependent on adenosine and increased adenosine A1R activation , since blockade of A1Rs with its selective antagonist 8-cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropylxanthine restored wild-type-like seizure-induced excitotoxic cell death.37 Astrogliosis is a pathological hallmark of the epileptic brain and contributes to seizure generation by a variety of mechanisms.12,119,120 A recent study in our laboratory has identified the enzyme ADK in astrocytes as a molecular link between astrogliosis and neuronal dysfunction in epilepsy.37 In a mouse model of CA3-selective epileptogenesis , we found spatio-temporal colocalization of astrogliosis , upregulated ADK , and focal spontaneous electrographic seizures that were all restricted to the CA3 region , the site of the epileptogenesis precipitating acute injury importantly , seizures could be suppressed pharmacologically by ADK inhibition.37 In this model , the seizures remained highly localized and restricted to the astrogliotic scar , presumably due to normal adenosinergic control of the surrounding brain tissue . Transgenic overexpression of ADK , as well as genetic disruption of the A1R , was sufficient to trigger spontaneous seizures , indicating that adenosine dysfunction rather than astrogliosis per se was responsible for seizure generation.121 Conversely , mice with genetically induced reduction of ADK in forebrain were completely resistant to the development of spontaneous seizures.37 In vitro studies performed on hippocampal slices have subsequently demonstrated that reduction of the basal tone of adenosine by ADK is permissive to seizure generation , whereas ADK did not limit activity-dependant adenosine release.122 Together , these findings provide a neurochemical rationale for adenosine augmenta-tion therapies AATs . Consequently , several focal AAT-approaches , based on intracerebral adenosine-releasing implants , have demonstrated robust anticonvulsive and , possibly , antiepileptogenic efficacy in a variety of experi-mental paradigms that have been reviewed elsewhere.123,124 Traumatic brain injury . Traumatic brain injury triggers an acute surge in adenosine , presumably as a consequence of ATP release , and this may represent an endogenous neuroprotective mechanism . In one study , adenosine levels increased 61-fold following controlled cortical impact CCI in rats and peaked at 20 min following the impact.125 The existence of an endogenous protective action of adenosine at A1 receptors early after experimental TBI was further corroborated by the finding of lethal status epilepticus in A1 R-knockout mice subjected to either controlled cortical impact.126 or to kainic acid-induced hippocampal injury.127 In contrast to A1R-knockout mice , A2AR-knockout mice were largely protected from the adverse effects of CCI.128 In line with these findings , increases in cerebrospinal fluid caffeine concentration were associated with favorable outcome after severe traumatic brain injury in humans , likely due to caffeine-mediated inhibition of A2ARs.129 Likewise , chronic , but not acute , caffeine attenuated the consequences of TBI in the mouse CCI model.130 Although it probably does not contribute to the surge in adenosine following brain injury , acute downregulation of ADK in astrocytes has been described as a consequence of stroke36 or acute seizures , 131 and this may prolong the adenosine increase . Parkinson�s disease . The adenosine A2A receptor is a leading non-dopaminergic therapeutic target in Parkinson�s disease PD Figure 4 . Interest in this receptor within the context of PD derives primarily from two lines of experimental and clinical investigations first , decade-long preclinical studies demonstrated a unique colocalization of A2ARs and dopamine D2Rs in striatopallidal neurons . Antagonistic interactions between A2ARs and D2Rs at the molecular , neurochemical , and behavioral level explain the motor-stimulant effects of A2AR blockade.132�134 Thus , A2AR antagonists , such as KW-6002 istradefylline and SCH420814 , have now completed clinical phase IIB�III trials . Despite some limitations of these clinical trials and admittedly modest effects �OFF� time reduced by one hour , these studies confirm that selective A2AR antagonists can stimulate motor activity by potentiating the L-dopa effect in advanced PD patients.135,136 Second , in addition to symptomatic relief , A2AR antagonists appear to more directly attenuate dopaminergic neurodegeneration , as suggested by convergent epidemiological and experimental evidence . Following an initial report from the Honolulu Heart Program137 by Ross and co-workers , several large-cohort , prospective studies have confirmed a similar inverse relationship between the consumption of caffeinated coffee and the risk of developing PD . Including the Health Professionals� Follow-Up Study and the Nurses� Health Study these studies involved a total of 47 351 men and 88 565 women , 138 whereas a more recent study conducted by the Finnish Mobile Clinic Health Examination Survey included 19 518 men and women.139 These studies firmly established a relationship between increased caffeine consumption and decreased risk of developing PD in males . In addition , studies with animal models of PD provide a compelling clue about the potentially protective effects of caffeine , by demonstrating that pharmacological blockade by caffeine or selective A2AR antagonists or genetic depletion of the A2AR attenuates dopaminergic neurotoxicity and neurodegeneration.140�142 These studies provide a neurobiological basis for the inverse relationship between increased caffeine consumption and reduced risk of developing PD . Despite consistent demonstration that A2AR antagonists afford neuroprotection against MPTP or 6-hydroxydopamine-induced dopaminergic neurotoxicity , the mechanism by which A2AR inactivation protects against the loss of dopaminergic neurons remains unknown . The particular challenge lies in explaining the apparent dichotomy between restricted ex-pression of the A2AR in striatopallidal neurons and neuropro-tection against degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra where only a scattered expression of A2ARs is detected . An additional challenge is to identify the cellular mechanism , which allows A2AR inactivation to protect neurons against a broad spectrum of brain insults , from ischemia to excitotoxicity to mitochondrial toxicity.143 In this context , the involvement of the glial A2AR becomes an attractive possibility , since glial function and neuroinflamma-tion is commonly associated with diverse pathological condi-tions as mentioned above . Indeed , we recently demonstrated that MPTP treatment markedly upregulates A2AR expression in microglial cells at 24�48 h after treatment , 65,66 which may result in further amplification of the A2AR-mediated modulation of neuroinflammation in PD models . Consistent with this notion , an immunohistochemical study showed that KW-6002 reduced the loss of striatal dopamine contents and nigral cell bodies , and this coincided with inhibition of microglial activation.144 Furthermore , we demonstrated by flow cytometry that KW-6002 attenuated MPTP-induced microglial activation at 48 h after MPTP treatment.117 In conclusion , A2AR antagonists may confer neuroprotection by acting at A2ARs in glial cells , at least in the MPTP model of PD . Ischemia . During ischemia an imbalance between ATP degradation and resynthesis brings about a rapid and marked increase in extracellular level of adenosine in the brain during ischemia.145�154 In addition hypoxia will increase ATP release , resulting in further adenosine production . Although no clinical reports with purinergic compounds in human stroke exist , it is widely believed that adenosine and its receptors function as an endogenous neuroprotectant under these conditions.155�161 Indeed , adenosine162 or adenosine-potentiating agents such as inhibitors of ADA or ADK , 163�167 or of adenosine transport151,166,168�173 offer protection against ischemic neuronal damage in different in vivo ischemia models . Furthermore , transgenic overexpression of ADK aggravates cell death , whereas reduction of ADK level in the hippocampus increases protection after transient focal ischemia.36,174 Such a protective effect is attributed to stimulation of adenosine A1 receptors that exert a protective role in ischemia by presynaptic reduction of Ca2 ? influx , by inhibition of the release of excitatory neurotransmitters , 175,176 and by post-synaptic hyper-polarization and reduction of neuronal activity through increases in K ? and Cl ion conductances.177 The efficacy of A1 receptor stimulation on neuroprotection depends on the model used and no protective effect was observed in a global ischemia model.178 Since adenosine does influence glutamate release , it is suggested that this is not critically important in some ischemic models . However , adenosine probably acting at the A2A receptor may in fact contribute to neurotoxicity , neuronal damage , and cell death . The potential neuroprotection by A2AR antagonists was first reported in a global ischemia model with the less selective antagonist CGS 15 943.179,180 Further studies substantiated this finding in different models of ischemia with the selective A2A receptor antagonist 8-3-chlorostyryl caffeine CSC and SCH 58 261181,147,182 in various animal models of stroke.183,184 Studies of genetically manipulated mice confirmed the neuroprotective role of A2A receptor antago-nists on ischemic brain damage.185 Major protective effects of A2A receptor antagonists in stroke have been attributed to reduced glutamate outflow.183,186,187 It should be considered however , that in several studies , A2A receptor agonists have been found protective in the global ischemia model in the gerbil180 and that A2A-knockout mice show aggravated hypoxic ischemic injury in neonatal mice.188 Possible mechanisms are not clear yet , but include A2AR-mediated protection via inhibition of platelet aggregation , vasodila-tion , 163,189 or anti-inflammatory actions . Lastly , activation of A3Rs produced mixed results and the exact contribution of A3Rs to ischemic brain injury is not clear.190 So far , support for a role for glia in the neuroprotective effect of A2AR antagonism in ischemia comes from the observation that the A2A receptor antagonist SCH 58261 reduces p38 MAPK activation in microglial cells184 and phospho-JNK in neurons and oligodendrocytes191 in the ischemic hemisphere 24 h after permanent MCAO . Since p38 MAPK and JNK are activated up to 24 h after ischemia192,193 and are involved in neuronal death , 194,195 this correlation indicates that A2AR antagonists may confer neuroprotection against ischemic brain injury through modulation of glial function and neuro-inflammation . However , reduced MAPK activation might be secondary to a reduction in the excitotoxic cascade that primes p38 and JNK activation , since reduction glutamate outflow in the ischemic brain by A2AR blockade is believed to be one of the main underlying mechanisms.196 Further studies with selective manipulation of glial ARs or glial function in vivo are critical to our understanding to what extend adenosine regulation of glial signaling and function is responsible for ischemic brain injury . Conclusions and Major Open Questions The discussion above has shown that much is now known about a role of glial cells in mediating the effects of adenosine and other purines in different neurodegenerative states . It is clear that many of the actions of endogenous or exogenous adenosine and ATP are in fact due to actions on glial cells . This makes it much more complicated to understand precisely how adenosine acts , and it has become apparent that the often diverse actions reported are due to the fact that several different receptors , located on many cell types , are involved . In order to get a better understanding , there are several major questions that require an answer . Among the questions that need to be addressed in future research we find 1 . Is the acute adenosine surge that follows brain injury a trigger for subsequent astrocyte activation ? 2 . Do all the proposed mechanisms of ATP release from glial cells in fact occur , and are the triggers for astrocytic ATP release via these mechanisms different ? 3 . To what extent does regional variation in the expression of ecto-nucleotidases control the distribution of adenosine in brain ? 4 . Can adenosine signals propagate within the brain via astrocyte�astrocyte communication ? 5 . Given the major increase in glial cells in humans , how far can we extrapolate from rodents to man ? 6 . When several ARs , with at least partly opposing signaling , appear to regulate a single biological response , are the receptors located on different cells or on very different parts of the same cell ? 7 . Given that two GPCR molecules can form dimers , but apparently only one of them can actually signal , is there any functional significance of heterodimers between two types of purine receptors ? 8 . Can activation of endothelial cells at the vascular interphase signal to synapses ? 9 . Are microglial cells directly involved in synaptic transmis-sion or do they mainly help prune synaptic contacts ? 10 . Why are effects of A2ARs on inflammation different in CNS and peripheral organs ? Schmiedebergs Arch Pharmacol 2000 362 299�309 . 36 .

Figure 1 Extracellular adenosine levels are thought to be regulated by an astrocyte-based adenosine cycle . Astrocytes can release ATP via vesicular release and or by direct release through hemichannels h-ch . Extracellular ATP is rapidly degraded into adenosine ADO by a series of ectonucleotidases . Adenosine can also be released directly via equilibrative nucleoside transporters nt . Intracellularly adenosine levels are largely controlled by adenosine kinase , which is part of a substrate cycle between adenosine and AMP . Small changes in adenosine kinase activity rapidly translate into major changes in adenosine . Intracellular adenosine kinase is considered to be a metabolic reuptake system for adenosine . Only selected mechanisms and pathways are shown for details please refer to the main text Figure 2 ARs , their coupling to G-proteins , and some of the downstream consequences of receptor activation Figure 3 Role of the adenosine ADO ADK system in regulating acute and chronic responses to injury . Left Within hours after brain injury e.g. , stroke , trauma , prolonged seizures a surge in micromolar levels of ADO results that protects the brain from further injury and from seizures . Hypoxia and trauma can directly lead to a rise in extracellular ATP that is rapidly degraded into adenosine . High levels of adenosine are known to inhibit ADK , further amplifying the adenosine surge . Right The acute adenosine surge contributes to trigger astrogliosis via a variety of mechanisms that include modulation of astrocytic ARs , modulation of inflammatory processes , and release of cytokines . Astrogliosis leads to overexpression of ADK , resulting in adenosine deficiency , which contributes to seizure generation Figure 4 The dual functions of A2AR antagonists in PD models A2AR antagonists act at the A2AR in striatal neurons to stimulate motor activity . Furthermore , it is postulated that A2AR antagonists may modulate microglial activation in substantia nigra to exert a possible neuroprotective effect in an animal model of PD 
19876070	Review Muscular dystrophies are a heterogeneous group of inherited diseases , primarily characterized by severe and chronic skeletal muscle degeneration . Duchenne muscular dystrophy DMD is the most severe disease among similar dystrophic diseases and is caused by frame-shift deletions , duplications , or point mutations in dystrophin gene . Patient mobility is highly affected , usually resulting in wheelchair dependency , and death occurs due to respiratory or cardiac failure.1,2 New strategies for the treatment of this disease are currently being investigated and are categorized by two approaches endogenous activation and exogenous delivery Figure 1 . The first strategy consists of re-activating endogenous cells to achieve muscle hypertrophy , counter-acting the mass force loss in inflamed fibres . To reach this goal , a growing range of small molecules or recombinant proteins has been tested , including insulin-like growth factor 1 IGF1 , 3,4 MagicF15 or valproic acid.6 The second strategy , on the contrary , relies on exogenous tools gene and or cell therapies to improve muscle regeneration , thus providing new , functional fibres to the dystrophic muscle . Gene therapy targets the genetic defects , attempting to overcome patholo-gical mutations by providing the muscle with the correct form of the gene7 or by correcting the splicing through the exon-skipping vectors8,9 or drugs , such as PTC124.10 Cell therapy , however , is based on stem cell-driven muscle regeneration , by systemic or local injections . This review will focus on in vivo cell therapy strategies and improvements in the treatment of sarcoglycan dystrophin complex-related dystrophies , such as Duchenne or limb-girdle muscular dystrophies . Sarcoglycan dystrophin complex-related muscular dystro-phies are caused by disruption of the sarcoglycan�dystrophin complex that normally anchors the actin fibres to the sarcolemma , generally resulting in chronic muscle wastage , progressive fibrotic infiltrations and force decrease . Moreover , cardiac involvement is often described , in terms of chronic dilatative cardiomyopathy , scar infiltrations , aneurisms and repeated microinfarctions . DMD is the most severe form and it is caused by frame-shift mutations or huge deletions in the dystrophin gene . It is one of the largest gene in the human genome and encodes a 14-kb mRNA . In this type of dystrophy , the protein is completely or partially lost . A less severe phenotype is observed in Becker dystrophy , in which mutations still affect the dystrophin gene , but myofibres retain a truncated and low-active isoform of the protein . Some forms of limb-girdle muscular dystrophy LGMD2 are also caused by mutations in sarcoglycan complex proteins , for example , a-or b-sarcoglycan asg or bsg depletion , and can result in severe pathological phenotypes . Several animal models have been developed to study muscular dystrophies , particularly for DMD and LGMD2 . The most widely used model for dystrophy is the mdx mouse that carries an X-linked mutation in the dystrophin gene , thus mimicking , at least in principle , the DMD genotype in humans . In mdx mice , the effects of degeneration are less severe , mainly due to the presence of relatively high numbers of revertant fibres 1�3 % 11 and an upregulation of utrophin . Utrophin is a smaller analogue of the dystrophin and may account for the partial compensatory effect on muscle wastage.12,13 Recently , it has been demonstrated that mdx satellite cells undergo telomere erosion , which may also contribute to the inability of these cells to continuously repair DMD muscle . It is possible that muscle stem cells or myogenic progenitors that maintain telomerase activity until late passages , may contribute in part to the muscular regeneration , that provides mdx mice with a normal life span.14 Feasible models of LGMD2 are a-sarcoglycan-and b-sarcoglycan-knockout mice . These mice are very close to the human phenotype of LGMD2D and LGMD2E , respec-tively , as they show chronic skeletal muscle degeneration and , in the case of bsg-KO mice , dilatative cardiomyo-pathy.15,16 In a-sarcoglycan-KO mice , asg gene is disrupted through a neomycin cassette insertion between exons 1 and 9 , through homologous recombination of the flanking regions . Similarly , in the b-sarcoglycan-KO mice , the region encom-passing exons 3�6 of bsg gene is disrupted . LGMD mice are considered a better animal model than mdx mice because of their lack of revertant fibres , which often render mdx mice-related results controversial.17 Canine models of DMD are being also extensively studied.18,19 The larger fibres in canine muscles mimic the human dystrophy effects better than that of the mouse . At present , there are two major colonies of dystrophic dogs all over the world , bearing the same mutation in different genetic backgrounds a colony of Golden Retrievers and one of Beagle dogs . These animals are both derived through cross-breeding of a naturally born , affected founder because transgenic creation would be unethical in these animal models . The mutation lies in intron 6 of dystrophin gene and results in aberrant splicing that causes a premature transcrip-tion stop codon . Dystrophic dogs , from both varieties , show extremely affected motility , posing , salivation , severe chronic scar infiltrations and skeletal muscle degeneration . In these animals , revertant fibres are also almost undetectable , thus providing a good model to analyze regeneration effects of cell and genetic therapies . Cell Models for In Vivo Skeletal Muscle Regeneration To date , the only clinical treatments for muscular dystrophy are steroid administration and non-invasive intermittent positive pressure ventilation . These treatments result in amelioration of symptoms and improved quality of life.20 Despite the benefits of slightly longer lifespan , alleviation of pain and surgical management of scoliosis , this therapy shows many side effects , such as weight increase , and has no real beneficial effects on skeletal muscle architecture and force.21 Thus , cell therapy represents a theoretical valuable alternative . The main goal of cell therapy is to directly regenerate wasted , adult muscle fibres through systemic or targeted injection of stem cells , which function to block muscle loss and restore , at least partially , the normal muscular activity . It is currently a difficult task to conjugate high efficiencies in cell motility , homing , engraftment and differ-entiation into the complex environment of a severely inflammed and degenerated muscle . Several cell models have been tested in vivo , with diverse results Table 1 . Three main classes of stem cells with a myogenic differentiation potential have been considered for cell therapy protocols in preclinical studies for the treatment of muscular dystrophy i embryonic stem cells ESCs and induced pluripotent stem cells iPSs ii bone marrow-derived stem cells BMSCs and circulating progenitors and iii local myogenic-committed progenitors . ESCs and iPS cells . Embryonic stem cells ESCs are generally considered the most promising natural source of pluripotent cells for cell therapy , but few attempts have been reported in muscle regeneration and efficiencies are still quite low . Importantly , ethical issues around their pro-curement and use , such as blastocyst disgregation and oocyte requirement , have raised a lot of concerns and limited the use of human ESCs hESCs for research purposes in several countries . The critical step in using ESCs resides in cell conditioning before engraftment , a necessary step that increases the differentiation rate towards myogenesis and avoids teratoma formation . A heterogeneous suspension , derived from a co-culture of male embryoid bodies and female freshly isolated dystrophic satellite cells , has been demonstrated to produce few chimeric , dystrophin-positive myofibres in injured muscles of female mdx mice.22 Promising results have been obtained with hESCs , cultivated to enrich in mesenchymal precursors . The CD73 ? NCAM ? sub-fraction was able to differentiate into myotubes in vitro and , remarkably , to regenerate up to 7 % of injured skeletal muscle in immunodeficient mice.23 Recently , another strategy has been developed using paraxial mesoderm progenitors that are isolated from differentiating ESCs . The PDGFRa ? Flk1 fraction of Pax3-induced , embryoid body-derived cells shows activation of myogenic transcription factors in vitro and good differentiation in dystrophin ? fibres on transplantation into both cardiotoxin-injured and dystrophic muscle . Injected mice also show an amelioration of the contractility force . In this case , intra-arterial administration of cells resulted in higher engraftment than intravenous injection.24 In another study , paraxial mesoderm progenitors were isolated as PDGFRa ? VEGFR2 ? cells , which also have been successfully tested in cardiotoxin-injured quadriceps of KSN nude mice.25 A new source of pluripotent cells comes from the reprogramming of adult murine or human somatic cells , by means of pluripotency transcription factor expression . Human iPS induced pluripotent stem , hiPS cells are reprogram-med from differentiated , adult cells , such as fibroblasts , to an ES-like status , by retroviral-mediated transduction of OCT4 , SOX2 , KLF4 and , even if dispensable , c-MYC.26�28 As hiPS cells are created by reprogramming adult cells into a flexible , embryonic-like state , they have been claimed as alternative pluripotent cells to overcome the ethical issues regarding the use of ESCs . However , some reservations exist regarding the in vivo safety of hiPS cells , which must be addressed in the future . Recently , a wide range of disease-specific hiPS cells has been generated from patients with various Mendelian or complex diseases , including Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy.29 These cells could repre-sent a greater advancement in terms of plasticity and life span , in comparison with other cell lines tested to date . Moreover , these DMD-or BMD-specific hiPS cells show the same genetic background of the donor , thus representing a good model for in vitro drug testing and , if genetically corrected , a suitable cell line for extensive skeletal muscle repair . Bone marrow-derived and circulating progeni - tors . Mesenchymal stem cells have been tested in acute and chronic muscle wastage , but results are still controver-sial . After bone marrow transplantation BMT in dystrophic mice , BMSCs are able to migrate and contribute to the formation of new Myf5 ? fibres through repeated rounds of inflammation and regeneration , which is typical of the mdx mouse muscles.30 In humans , the clinical case of a young DMD patient deletion of the exon 45 in the dystrophin gene has been reported , which 12 years after BMT , showed donor nuclei fused to 0.5 % of dystrophic myofibres.31 Real-time RT-PCR analysis detected a small amount of a truncated , in-frame isoform of dystrophin , lacking exons 44 and 45 , and trace amounts of the wild-type gene 0.0005 % , although a direct correlation between the BMT-derived nuclei and the dystrophin isoform expression was missing . In addition , human mesenchymal stem cells isolated from synovial membrane of adult donors , on intramuscular delivery into tibialis anterior of mdx mice , efficiently produce new , func-tional myofibres , without any sign of fusion . These cells also contribute to the long-term satellite cell population and restore mechano growth factor MGF expression in treated muscles.32 The myogenic potential of these cells seems to be strongly related to the microenvironment surrounding the delivered cells because when injected systemically in dystrophic mice , they are observed in almost all tissues . Given the broad availability of the source , human multi-potent adipose-derived stem cells hMADS have been investigated as a possible alternative for muscle regeneration . hMADS are CD44 ? , CD90 ? and CD105 ? , confirming their mesenchymal lineage . Once injected intramuscularly into tibialis anterior of immunocompetent and immunosuppressed Table 1 Stem cell types for the treatment of chronic or acute skeletal muscle damage Stem cell types SMPs Muscle-SP cells mdx mice , they fuse with host fibres , resulting , 6 months later , in a large number of chimaeric myofibres expressing human dystrophin . Interestingly , no differences are reported between immuno-competent and immuno-suppressed hosts and it also seems that hMADS significantly reduce necrosis in the dystrophic muscle.33 These promising results have since been enhanced by priming the adipose-derived mesenchymal cells by co-culturing with myoblasts34 or forced MyoD expression.35 A sub-population of circulating , haematopoietic stem cells expressing CD133 , which constitutes another interesting and easily isolatable cell pool , has been reported to express early myogenic markers.36 Intramuscular or intra-arterial injection of genetically corrected CD133 ? progenitors , isolated from both peripheral blood and muscles of DMD patients , results in a significant recovery of muscle morphology , function and re-expression of human dystrophin in scid mdx mice.37 In contrast , several studies have reported of absent or incomplete muscle repair by mesenchymal or haematopoietic stem cells . On being intravenously injected into a mouse model for LGMD2F mice lacking d-sarcoglycan , bone marrow side population cells engraft and fuse into skeletal fibres , but do not restore d-sarcoglycan expression.38 Green fluorescent protein-positive bone marrow GFP ? BM cells , delivered through retro-orbital injection , fuse with B3 % of fibres in the tibialis anterior of treated mdx mice , but almost no dystrophin expression is detected in GFP ? myofibres . However , where dystrophin is detected , its expression is spatially more limited than in revertant fibres.39 These data have been confirmed in another study , in which it has been demonstrated that X80 % of BM-derived muscle-incorporated nuclei in the transplanted dystrophic mouse are �silent� . In-corporated nuclei fail to express myogenic factors , including dystrophin , and this �silencing� is still retained even in the presence of strong chromatin-remodelling agents , such as 50-azacytidine.40 It has also been demonstrated that haema-topoietic cell transplantation HCT alone result neither in any skeletal fibre regeneration nor in expression of dystrophin or other muscle genes.41 Nevertheless , an interesting role for HCT in muscle regeneration may come from immunoto-lerance effects towards allogeneic myoblast engraftment . DMD dogs have been successfully treated using both peripheral HCT and freshly isolated myoblasts from the same healthy donor . Donor myoblast-related dystrophin expression increased up to B7 % of wild-type levels and was maintained for at least 24 weeks , without any pharmacological immuno-suppression.42 Finally , bone marrow-derived multipotent adult progenitor cells MAPCs were observed to durably repair muscles in ischaemic limbs , by efficient revascularization of necrotic tissues.43 Local myogenic-committed progenitors . Satellite cells are quiescent unipotent myoprecursors , located between the fibre and the basal lamina during embryogenesis , they form during the second wave of myogenesis and , after contributing massively to the first post-natal muscle growth , they stop proliferating and reach their niche.44 They can also be re-activated on muscle damage , re-entering cell cycle and contributing to the formation of new muscle fibres.45 Given their natural commitment , it�s easy to imagine satellite cells as a major candidate for muscle regeneration in muscular dystrophies . On single fibre transplantation into radiation-ablated mdx tibialis anterior , donor satellite cells multiply and expand , re-populating the satellite cell pool and differentiate into functional myofibres.46 Pax7 ? CD34 ? GFP ? satellite cells , isolated from Pax3GFP ? mice diaphragms , have also been demonstrated to be a good cell model for mdx irradia-ted muscle treatment , resulting in the restoration of dystrophin expression in many skeletal fibres and contributing to the resident satellite compartment.47 Injections were adminis-tered intramuscularly and , notably , two major problems arose satellite cells have a very low migration capability and , furthermore , cells showed impaired engraftment capability when expanded in vitro , even if for few days.47 To test the regeneration capability of satellite cells at a clonal level , single-cell dilutions of CD34 ? integrina ? luciferase-expressing satellite cells were injected into the skeletal muscle of a NOD SCID mouse depleted of resident satellite cells by 18 Gy irradiation . It was shown by in vivo imaging that a single satellite cell can reconstitute the satellite compartment and , on further damage , can rapidly re-enter a new proliferation wave , generating new myofibres.48 Recently , interesting findings resulted from a prospective isolation of skeletal muscle precursors SMPs , consisting of a CD45 Sca1 Mac1 Cxcr4 ? b1-integrin ? subset within the endogenous satellite compartment . When injected into cardiotoxin-injured muscles in immunodeficient mdx mice , SMPs robustly contributed to muscle regeneration up to 94 % by fusing with pre-existing fibres or stimulating de novo myogenesis . Muscle histology and contractile force in treated mice were significantly better than those in untreated mice . Furthermore , SMPs contributed greatly to the endogenous satellite population , undergoing new cycles of re-activation on subsequent induced damage.49 However , as freshly isolated SMPs were injected , without in vitro expansion , the migration capability remains restricted in the areas surrounding the intramuscular injection site . One of the major concerns about satellite cells is that , probably , they are not a homogeneous population . As argued by Collins et al. , 46 the variable engraftment rate of satellite cells from a single myofibre transplantation could be due to the functional heterogeneity of the satellite cell pool and of their niche of origin . Satellite cell heterogeneity is still a contentious issue and has been extensively reviewed in several studies50,51 and is still open for debate.52 Muscle side population SP cells are defined as Sca1 ? CD45 ? cells , able to rapidly efflux the Hoechst dye 33342 , and are being investigated as potential myogenic progenitors . They are associated with the muscle vasculature and are spontaneously committed towards the haematopoietic line-age . On co-culture with myoblasts , they can form myotubes in vitro and , if injected intramuscularly into crushed tibialis of a scid bg immunodeficient mouse , can give rise to up to 1 % of regenerating fibres.53 The efficiency of SP-mediated muscle regeneration has been increased to 5�8 % by injection into the femoral artery of mdx5cv DMD mice , resulting in Pax7 and desmin expression by donor cells , after extravasation and recruitment to inflammation sites.54 Impressive results have been obtained with the identification of a rare subset 0.25 % of SP cells , characterized by both satellite-and SP-related markers , such as Sca1 ? ABCG2 ? Syndecan4 ? Pax7 ? , and found in the typical satellite compartment , under the basal lamina . Once sorted from the mononuclear fraction of the hind limb , they can grow in association with single muscle fibres and can robustly undergo myogenic differentiation in vitro . On intramuscular injection in the presence of 1.2 % BaCl2 , these satellite-SP cells have been shown to efficiently compete with endogenous satellite cells in regenerating the wild-type muscle . Injected cells resulted in 30 % fibre regeneration and , strikingly , in up to 75 % reconstitution of the endogenous satellite cell pool . The newly generated satellite cells were able to undergo new rounds of proliferation and muscle repair on subsequent injuries . Furthermore , the same long-term effects have been proven through injections into dystrophic mdx4cv tibialis anterior muscles , producing up to 70 % regenerating fibres.55 However , BaCl2-induced muscle damage is not a widely used and accepted regenera-tion model , and this must be taken into consideration when interpreting these findings . Recently , a new type of vessel-associated muscle-derived stem cells has been investigated as a suitable potential model for chronic muscle therapy , namely mesoangioblasts MABs . They can be isolated from the dorsal aorta of E9.5 embryo56 or from adult skeletal muscle of mice , dogs and humans.57�59 MABs are CD34 ? , Sca1 ? , PDGFRa ? , PDFGRb ? , NG2 ? and ALP ? , thus supporting the idea that they are a sub-group of the pericytic population.60 They show high proliferation rates in vitro , without transformation potential , and display , in in vitro and embryonic chimaera systems , multipotent differentiation capability towards myogenic , osteogenic , chon-drogenic and adipogenic lineages . On intra-arterial injection into inflammated muscles of asg-KO mice or DMD Golden Retriever dogs , they are capable of consistently regenerating up to 50 % the muscle architecture , sarcoglycan dystrophin expression and electrophysiological properties of wasted dystrophic muscle.57,58 Similarly , good results have been achieved through human MAB transplantation into scid�mdx immunodeficient dystrophic mice.59 Treatment of dogs with MABs resulted in very good and long-term results in some animals , in terms of general motility restoration and whole muscle regeneration , whereas other animals did not show a good engraftment and any clinical improvement.58 This confirms the general idea that back-ground variability in dystrophies in larger organisms , such as dogs or humans , has to be evaluated for effective cell therapies . Furthermore , another class of myogenic precursors has been isolated from endothelial population of adult human muscle , through FACS-mediated prospective isolation of CD56 ? CD34 ? CD144 ? cells . These myoendothelial pro-genitors , on injection into injured muscle of scid mice can achieve muscle engraftment and fibre neo-formation at an higher degree than CD56 ? canonical myoprecursors.61 Cell Conditioning and Priming To increase engraftment specificity and differentiation poten-tial , cell transplantation can be combined with pre-injection cell conditioning or with genetic manipulation . Cell migration limitations are often a major cause of low engraftment efficiencies in skeletal muscle , which is a very complex tissue with severely limited cell motility , particularly in the presence of large fibrotic or necrotic areas . Thus , some attempts have been made to assist migration by condition-ing cells with migration-enhancing soluble factors or by overexpressing commiting mobilizing proteins before apply-ing them to the degenerated muscle . A lot of interest has been shown in Notch signalling , as a potential enhancer of myogenic commitment . Rat BMSCs , transfected with a plasmid for the intracellular domain of Notch1 NICD and injected locally or intravenously into injured muscles of rats or nude mice , account for a very high level of regenerating fibres up to 89 % .62 Given that NICD is the active signalling form of the receptor , it could be possible that finer genetic tools to activate Notch signalling could enhance myogenesis by donor cell injection , although recently it has been demonstrated that a temporal switch from Notch to Wnt3a signalling activation is necessary during normal adult myogenesis.63 Encouraging in vivo results have come from cell therapy experiments involving soluble factor-dependent cell condi-tioning . Hmgb1 , a cytokine secreted by activated macro-phages and monocytes , is able to increase the recruitment of MABs out of the vessels into the muscle . Heparin�Sepharose beads , loaded with Hmgb1 and injected into the femoral artery , were shown to promote the trans-endothelial migration of intra-arterial-injected embryonic MABs into non-injured tibialis anterior of wild-type mice.64 Pre-treatment of MABs with mobilization cytokines , such as SDF1 and TNFa , highly increase MAB homing into dystrophic muscle of asg-null mice , thus reducing approximately 50 % the aspecific homing into filter organs . Their regenerative effect was magnified by TNFa priming and a4-integrin overexpression.65 Furthermore , improving the angiogenic potential in necrotic areas could help cell therapy . For example , tendon fibroblasts expressing placenta growth factor PIGF , an angiogenic factor and matrix metalloproteinase 9 MMP9 , injected intramuscu-larly into aged asg-KO mice , result in a dramatic increase in the extension of regenerated dystrophin ? muscle areas after intra-arterial delivery of wild-type MABs.66 Such results corroborate the idea that a deeper knowledge of cytokines and angiogenic factors regulating the inflammation-depen-dent recruitment of myoprecursors will serve to improve the benefits mediated by cell therapy . Genetic Manipulation for Autologous Cell Therapy Correction of the dystrophic genotype in the transplanted cells could allow the usage of autologous cells , instead of heterologous wild-type cells , thus avoiding immunosuppres-sive drugs . A widely used strategy relies on lentiviral transduction of muscle-regenerating cells to allow integration and expression of the disrupted gene . To correct DMD , several alternatives of the dystrophin gene which is too long to be introduced in a lentiviral vector exist , such as micro-or mini-dystrophin . These are shorter isoforms of the native protein , which retain a partial functionality , thus providing , in principle , a possible molecular rescue on differentiation towards newly formed myofibres . mdx5cv mice , injected intravenously with auto-logous muscle-SP cells that were previously transduced with human micro-dystrophin hmDYS -expressing lentiviruses , show some skeletal fibres positive for the human version of the lacking protein.67 Similarly , very good results came from transplantation of hmDYS-transduced human pericytes into mdx�scid mice.59 In GRMD dog treatment , autologous MABs , transduced with human micro-dystrophin , induced a quite widespread expression of dystrophin and other proteins of the sarcoglycan complex in analyzed muscles and a partial recovery of the histological architecture . However , treated dogs had poorly restored general motility and force.58 These results may support the idea that , especially in higher organisms , mini-or micro-genes are not so feasible , or , at least , show highly variable and only short-term effects . Genetic correction can be addressed also for treatment of other genetic defects resulting in dystrophy , as when asg-KO MABs , carrying a lentiviral asg cDNA construct under a constitutive promoter , are injected into LGMD2D mice , there is extensive fibre regeneration , mobility and muscle force recovery.57 Conclusions and Perspectives Stem cell-based therapy is the most attractive approach for the treatment of DMD and other muscular dystrophies , and research in this direction has moved rapidly in past few years . Experiments in small and large animal models are paving the way for clinical experimentation , but it would be imprudent to predict a �cure� from these first attempts . Nevertheless , several clinical trials have been started or planned , involving myoblast or perycyte injection from HLA-matched donors and , given the growing variety of possible myogenic progenitors in literature , the number will increase during the near future . Other clinical trials are focusing on gene-or antibody-based strategies , such as adeno-associated viruses carrying g-sarcoglycan or m-dystrophin and antibody-triggered myo-statin blockade.21 Furthermore , encouraging results have come from clinical trials related to exon-skipping technology . Specific exons carrying mutations can be skipped by antisense oligonucleo-tides administration to restore the reading frame and result in the production of internally deleted , but functional dystrophin . Recently , two clinical trials involving two different drugs , AVI-4658 developed by the MDEX Consortium , United Kingdom and manufactured by AVI BioPharma , Bothell , WA , USA and PRO051 developed by University of Leiden , The Nederlands in collaboration with Prosensa B.V. , were performed on Duchenne patients . In both trials , biopsy data showed that injections of antisense oligonucleotides , to skip exon 51 , into dystrophic muscles , successfully induced new dystrophin production , with no adverse events . These pioneering studies are now followed by randomized controlled trials of systemic therapies both in The Netherlands and the United Kingdom . Therefore , it is reasonable to expect encouraging results that may also drive a combination of the stem cell-and gene-based therapies . It is critical to better understand the biological properties of stem cells and their paracrine role in the treatment of muscular diseases , to realize the potential positive effects of these new cures . The scientific community largely accepts the presence of adult stem cells in all tissues but their origin is still contro-versial . We and other authors suggest pericytes as a source of stem cells present in skeletal and cardiac muscles.59,60 They are influenced by their surrounding when maintaining a specific cell commitment , although this has to be clarified in pathological tissues . Interestingly , other research groups have identified mesenchymal cells as stem cells for all tissues , 68 raising questions regarding the possibility that the primary source of cell plasticity is confined to the bone marrow . It could be possible that cells move from bone marrow towards pericyte compartment , to adopt a specific cell fate , influenced by local niche . To further elucidate their origin , it is necessary to generate transgenic animals to track endogenous stem cells during muscle development and regeneration . Despite the fact that current regulatory restrictions will defer the clinical translation of new approaches , that are successful in animal models , several trials have been started . Moreover , the actual huge costs of GLP�GMP good laboratory and manufacture practice stem cell technology limit the feasibility of cell therapy treatment for patients affected by muscular dystrophy . However , strategies to lower costs are being investigated to develop treatments that are available for large numbers of patients . In conclusion , it is critical to better understand the biological properties of stem cells and their paracrine role in the treatment of muscular diseases , to realize the potential positive effects of these new cures . Therefore , it is reasonable to expect encouraging results from the on-going trials that may also drive a combination of stem cell-and gene-based therapies for the treatment of muscular dystrophies .

19927157	Review In recent years , the classical dichotomy between inflamma-tory and degenerative diseases of the central nervous system CNS has been challenged by a series of discoveries showing that the two processes coexist both in degenerative disorders � such as Alzheimer�s disease or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis � and in classical inflammatory disorders , such as multiple sclerosis MS .1,2 Multiple sclerosis is the most common cause of neurological disability in young adults , believed to follow immune-mediated aggression of the central myelin by blood-borne autoreactive T lymphocytes . In many cases , the clinical course of MS is characterized by recurrent episodes of neurological deficits in the early stages relapsing-remitting MS RRMS , and by a progressive neurological decline after 15�20 years from the diagnosis secondary progressive MS .3 A minority of MS patients has a progressive course from the onset , with rare or nonexistent clinical relapses primary progressive MS .3,4 Inflammatory demyelination of the white matter of the CNS is the primary pathological hallmark of RRMS , whereas gray matter atrophy and neuronal degeneration predominate in the progressive forms of the disease.5 Recent discoveries , however , have led to a reconsideration of the perceived www.nature.com cdd relationship between inflammation and neurodegeneration in MS , because it is now accepted that one process is not simply the culminating event of the other . Inflammation and neurodegeneration , in fact , seem to be intermingled rather than occurring in series in this disorder . Common molecular pathways bringing together the two pathological processes have , in fact , been described.1,2 Activated immune cells are able to damage neurons in the absence of any antigen specificity.6,7 Damaged neurons do trigger local CNS-con-fined auto immune responses.8 Brain atrophy and cortical thinning , reduction in neuronal-specific markers , iron deposi-tion and other gray matter abnormalities have been found in the inflammatory phase of MS RRMS subjects with conventional and advanced in vivo imaging techniques . Cognitive deficit has been described in a relevant percentage of MS patients already at the first episode of the disease clinically isolated syndrome .9 All together , these pieces of evidence support the concept that gray matter and white matter alterations in MS patients might initially occur independently , as a result of CNS-confined inflammatory processes , and then evolve intermingled as neurodegenera-tion can be the consequence of primary neuroinflammation and vice versa.3�5 To support this working hypothesis , it is noteworthy to mention that in addition to focal axon damage secondary to demyelination , and to retrograde , anterograde and transneuronal degeneration , axon transection can be induced by cytotoxic T cells as well as soluble molecules released by CNS resident microglia and invading blood-borne mononuclear cells inflammatory cells e.g. , axon-specific antibodies , complement , NO , oxygen radicals , proteases and eicosanoids .10 Finally , neuronal damage in MS can also be due to acquired neuronal channelopathies , altered activity of sodium calcium exchanger , glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity , intraneuronal calcium accumulation and inhibition of mitochondrial respiratory chain.10,11 Role of Glutamate in MS Neuronal Injury Glutamate is the major excitatory neurotransmitter in the CNS , and its concentration at the synaptic cleft is finely regulated by multiple mechanisms , which include the gluta-mate-glutamine cycle and the activity of glutamate uptake and transport mechanisms . Altered glutamate metabolism resul-ting in excessive synaptic excitation has been convincingly associated with neuronal damage in many acute and chronic neurological disorders , through a process termed excitotoxi-city.12 Excitotoxic neuronal damage is therefore the result of abnormal intracellular ion accumulation flowing through NMDA and non-NMDA glutamate receptors , leading to membrane lysis and to the activation of fatal degenerative processes and dendritic apoptosis.12 Also , metabotropic glutamate mGlu receptors have been claimed to modulate excitotoxic neuronal damage , as group I mGlu receptors mGlu 1 and 5 have a preferential synaptic localization and shape both AMPA13,14 and NMDA signaling and toxicity , 15 whereas group II mGlu mGlu 2 and 3 and group III mGlu receptors mGlu 4 , 6 , 8 are preferentially located in presynaptic neuronal elements or in glial cells , where they can be both neuroprotective15 or detrimental for neuronal survival.16,17 Early studies have identified the neurotransmitter glutamate as an important determinant of neurodegenerative damage in the course of MS.18,19 In fact , glutamate levels increase in the cerebrospinal fluid20,21 and in the brains of MS patients , 18,19 whereas the AMPA , NMDA and kainate receptors are upregulated.22 In addition , expressions of glutamate trans-porters are altered in MS23�25 and in animal models of the disease , 26,27 and the loss of glutamate transporters in cortical lesions correlates with microglial activation and synaptic damage.28 Finally , overactivation of glutamate receptors causes MS-like lesions , 29 whereas glutamate receptor an-tagonists exert beneficial effects in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis EAE 30�33 and in MS , 34 by limiting not only oligodendrocyte but also neuronal damage.30,31,35 When administered at the onset of neurological deficits , various AMPA receptor antagonists NBQX , MPQX , GYKI52466 , GYKI53773 have been found to be capable of attenuating clinical decline , independently of any effect on CNS lympho-cyte infiltration.18,19 The same was true for the NMDA receptor antagonists memantine , amantadine and MK-801,27,28 and for the inhibitor of glutamate transmission riluzole.36 We have recently found that the in vivo blockade of AMPA receptors not only ameliorated the clinical course of EAE , but also preserved dendritic spine loss occurring in this model of MS . These results support the involvement of AMPA receptors in EAE-induced dendritic spine degeneration.35 Furthermore , glutamate-triggered neurodegeneration might be favored by a parallel alteration of GABA transmission in MS brains , causing an imbalance between synaptic excitation and inhibition . Accordingly , a neurophysiological study has reported a marked brain hyperexcitability in MS patients , likely resulting from impaired GABA-mediated synaptic inhibition , 37 and preliminary evidence is also available in mice with EAE D. Centonze , manuscript in preparation . Alteration of Synaptic Transmission in Experimental MS Activated leukocytes and microglia are the most accredited source of glutamate during inflammation of the CNS , 38,39 whereas synaptic release has received some attention only recently . By means of conventional whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from single neurons , we recently addressed glutamate-mediated synaptic currents in corticostriatal brain slices from C57Bl 6 mice immunized with myelin oligoden-drocyte glycoprotein 35�55 peptide to induce EAE.35 We found that the duration of glutamate-mediated spontaneous and miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents sEPSCs and mEPSCs was increased in striatal cells in both the presymptomatic and clinical phases of the disease , as expected for enhanced excitatory transmission in these neurons . In particular , we found a slower decay phase of sEPSC and mEPSCs , whereas rise time and amplitude of these synaptic events were normal . Glutamate NMDA receptors were not involved in this alteration , which was entirely mediated by AMPA receptors . As the activity of AMPA receptors is known to be regulated by both the expression and phosphorylation states of specific receptor subunits , 40 we also measured the expression of the GluR1 subunit of AMPA receptors and its phosphorylation at the Ser845 residue . In isolated striatal postsynaptic membranes and in the whole dissected striatum , we found that both total GluR1 and GluR1-p-Ser845 expression were upregulated in EAE , whereas markers of presynaptic activity were normal.35 These results suggested to us that postsynaptic sites of striatal neurons were exposed to excessive glutamate activity in EAE , possibly causing synaptic degeneration since the very early phases of the disease , as schematically depicted in Figure 1 . However , it is extremely unlikely that excessive AMPA receptor function is the only synaptic event leading to dendritic and neuronal degeneration in EAE brains , as many transmitter systems and receptor subtypes are altered in this disorder and in MS . Reduced signaling through cannabinoid CB1 receptors , for example , has been identified as an early synaptic change in EAE , 41 and this alteration might well contribute to dendritic pathology and neuronal loss . In fact , we have recently found that voluntary exercise can attenuate the clinical deficits of mice with EAE by preserving cannabinoid CB1-mediated transmission and dendritic integrity even in the absence of overt effects on glutamate transmission . EAE-induced abnormalities of glutamate-mediated sEPSCs were , in fact , still present in mice with EAE with access to a running wheel , although this therapeutic environmental manipulation was capable of reducing clinical score and dendritic spine loss in these mice.42 Along with AMPA and NMDA receptors , mGlu receptors are also likely to contribute to glutamate transmission changes in EAE and in MS brains . For example , a significant reduction in the expression of mGlu 1 receptors has been reported to occur concomitantly with increased mGlu 5 receptors in the cerebellum of mice with EAE as well of patients with MS , 43 whereas both receptors increase in the context of MS lesions.23 Also , mGlu 2 , 3 , 4 and 8 have been found to increase in active MS lesions , especially in reactive astrocytic and microglial cells.23,24 The impact of these complex adaptations on synaptic transmission and secondary neuro-degeneration has not yet been explored , and it is difficult to predict , as both neuroprotective and detrimental effects could be postulated . Accordingly , mGlu 1 receptors are critically involved in AMPA-mediated long-term synaptic depression , 13,14 implying that the dramatic downregulation of these receptors seen in EAE and in MS might favor AMPA-mediated neuronal toxicity . In line with this hypothesis , treatment with the mGlu 1 receptor enhancer resulted in ameliorated motor performance in mice with EAE.43 Increased signaling through mGlu 5 receptors might also be involved in the neurodegenerative damage of MS , as the activation of these receptors has been found to exacerbate NMDA-mediated excitotoxicity.15 Role of EAE-Specific Inflammatory T Cells in Synaptic Functioning Under physiological conditions , T-cell trafficking from periph-eral tissues to the brain is essential for CNS immunosurveil-lance from danger signals . Such immunosurveillance may also include the preservation of an appropriate synaptic transmission , which is essential for the physiological function-ing of the CNS cells . As a matter of fact , it has been recently shown that inflammatory effector T cells can inhibit hippo-campal long-term potentiation LTP in vitro.44 In EAE , effector T cells activated in the periphery against myelin antigens and subsequently invading the CNS are considered as the primum movens of the experimental disease and , as shown by passive T-cell transfer experi-ments , do substantially contribute to clinical deficits that are caused by primary inflammation , followed by secondary demyelination and axonal damage.3 Several lines of evidence suggest that T-cell CNS invasion might also considered as the first step in the chain of events leading to brain inflammation and secondary neurodegeneration occurring in MS patients.39,45 Thus , we first investigated whether EAE-specific T cells were involved in the abovementioned synaptic transmission deficits seen in EAE . In the presymptomatic and symptomatic phases of EAE , we found inflammatory infiltrates in the striatum and the cortex mainly composed by CD3 ? T cells . This indicates that not only the white matter but also the gray matter structures are infiltrated by these cells during experimental MS . After aseptically removing the spleens and lymph nodes from donor mice with EAE , we prepared suspensions of CD3 ? T lymphocytes and placed them onto a single brain slice obtained from normal mice , to see whether the activated T lymphocytes were able to replicate the synaptic alterations seen in EAE brains . EAE-specific CD3 ? T cells were indeed able to alter glutamate-mediated sEPSC kinetic properties in slices from control animals , in a way reminiscent of the defects seen in EAE brains . However , it was not only sEPSC decay time but also sEPSC rise time that was altered by T lymphocytes , possibly indicating that these inflammatory cells change glutamate-mediated synaptic transmission by altering the activity of both NMDA and AMPA receptors.35 T cells infiltrating the brain not only regulate synaptic transmission and plasticity mediated by glutamate , 30,35 but are also regulated by this neurotransmitter , as they respond to glutamate by activating a neuroprotective pathway.46 Thus , glutamate-mediated control over T cells invading the CNS might function as a feedback regulatory mechanism to limit T-cell-induced excitotoxic damage , but a failure of this potentially neuroprotective system has been described in T lymphocytes from MS patients.47 Role of Activated Microglia in EAE-Specific Synaptic Alteration The identification of CNS-resident astroglia and microglia as important components of innate immunity was indeed crucial to understand the role of inflammation in neuronal damage . Although reactive gliosis was considered as a well-known event solely accompanying both acute and chronic neuronal damage epiphenomenally , it is now becoming clear that this phenomenon is also of pivotal importance in regulating and instructing the harmful inflammatory response causing neu-ronal network derangement . On the one hand , activated astroglia can mediate both the protective and toxic effects during neurodegenerative diseases.48 On the other , reactive microglia has an active role in the defensive attack against viruses and bacteria , but intense activation can also be detrimental for the survival of neighboring cells when this activation aims at clearing up apoptotic cells or neuron debris during neurodegenerative disorders.49,50 This dual role of glial cells in the CNS during inflammatory and neurodegenerative disorders has prompted us to hypothesize that infiltrating CD3 ? T cells might activate , through the release of proinflammatory cytokines , endogenous microglial cells , which in turn could contribute to the synaptic alterations we have observed in mice with EAE . To test this hypothesis , we stimulated microglial primary cell cultures with a cocktail of proinflammatory Th1 cytokines tumor necrosis factor-a , TNFa interferon-g , IFNg and inter-leukin-1b , IL-1b , which are released within the striatum during acute inflammation.35 We next tested whether or not activa-tion of microglia in the striatal areas might lead to synaptic transmission alterations . Incubation of control brain slices with in vitro activated microglia increased the duration of sEPSCs by slowing their decay phases . These results mimicked the synaptic deficits seen in mice with EAE . We also found that activated microglia deposited on slices from mice with EAE did not further increase the sEPSC decay phase , indicating that EAE occluded the effects of activated microglia on this parameter.35 These results support the conclusion that microglia , activated by effector T cells invading the brain , are responsible for synaptic alterations in EAE Figure 2 . Role of Activated Microglia in Neuronal Damage Inflammatory processes occurring within the CNS trigger a rapid activation of microglia . This activation is evident in situ as such cells show a rapid morphological transition from resting �ramified� cells to amoeboid-activated cells.51 Morpho-logical changes are also accompanied by functional changes as reactive microglia enter in a proliferating phase leading to a substantial increase in their number within the inflamed tissue52 Figure 1 . This activation entails a multitude of metabolic changes sustaining the ability of these cells to function as phagocytes and antigen-presenting cells . In mice with EAE , we detected the first cohort of proliferating microglial cells preceding the onset of the disease , 35 reaching a peak of proliferation at 20 days on immunization d.p.i and declining during the chronic phase of the disease . We further confirmed using short labeling protocols based on acute 50Iodio 20deoxyuridine administration that microglia proliferate actively during the acute but not the chronic phase of EAE L. Muzio , personal communication . We can only hypothe-size , at this stage , that a wave of microglial proliferation is followed by a wave of programmed cell death , 53 possibly as a compensatory feedback phenomenon . Whether or not activation of microglia during the acute phase of EAE is sufficient to induce neuronal cell death is still a matter of debate , as previous studies have convincingly shown that acutely activated microglia produce potentially toxic inflammatory mediators , but chronically activated micro-glia enhance growth and survival of neural progenitor stem cells and produce immunosuppressive cytokines.54�56 At this stage , we can only speculate that neurons may undergo programmed cell death at later time points during the course of EAE . Although several studies are in line with this idea , 45,46,57,58 the nature of the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon is not well understood . Nevertheless , the morphological and functional changes of microglial cells observed in mice with EAE Figure 3 clearly support the ensuing idea that activated microglia exert a key role in determining synaptic alterations and possibly neuronal damage . It is also important to note that the relationship between microglial cells and synaptic transmission and damage in MS seems to be particularly complex , as activated microglia in the gray matter , similar to T cells , both regulate and are regulated by glutamate signaling . Activated microglial cells , in fact , are capable of releasing57,58 and of metabolizing glutamate , 57,58 and in regulating the sensitivity of neuronal AMPA receptors to synaptically released glutamate.57,58 In addition , stimulation of mGlu 2 receptors which are upregu-lated in MS lesions57,58 enhances microglia-dependent TNFa release and neurotoxicity , 16,17 whereas activation of micro-glial mGlu 3 , 4 and 8 also upregulated in MS lesions57,58 has the opposite effect.45 Finally , in white matter MS lesions , microglia macrophage activity is essential to clear myelin debris , thus promoting remyelination.59 Role of Inflammatory Cytokines in Synaptic Alteration Many soluble mediators are released by activated T lympho-cytes and microglia during neuroinflammatory diseases , and have the potential to influence synaptic transmission.60�63 In particular , TNFa , IFNg and IL-1b are all potential candidates for such an action , as they are released in response to microglial activation , 49,50,64,65 increase in the CSF of MS patients , 66�68 and have been shown in vitro to enhance excitatory synaptic transmission60,62,69 and downregulate GABA synapses.60 As a matter of fact i IL-1b increases glutamate NMDA receptor-mediated synaptic transmis-sion , 70,71 and also regulates AMPA receptor expression and phosphorylation 62 ii TNFa increases AMPA receptor ex-pression and synaptic efficacy , an effect also relevant for synaptic plasticity 60,61 and iii IFNg has been shown to was consistently activated in mice with EAE b compared with healthy controls induce excitotoxic damage by enhancing AMPA receptor activity through the formation of a neuron-specific , calcium-permeable receptor complex with the GluR1 subunit of AMPA receptors.69 We have identified TNFa as a critical molecule involved in the synaptic alterations seen in mice with EAE , as we found that TNFa mRNA content increased in EAE brains in parallel to microglial activation.35 Incubation of control brain slices with TNFa mimicked the effects of EAE and of activated microglia on sEPSC kinetic properties , by increasing their decay time and duration . Furthermore , as in the case of the activated microglia , TNFa administration failed to alter other parameters of glutamate transmission , and did not increase further sEPSC duration in slices from mice with acute EAE . Together , these data suggest that TNFa has the potential to promote dendritic spine loss in EAE brains35 through an excitotoxic mechanism . Direct evidence of this process is , however , still lacking . Finally , to confirm the role of TNFa in the synaptic effects of activated microglia , we performed recordings in slices incubated with both activated primary microglia and TNFR-Ig , blocker of the activity of ambient TNFa . In these experiments , a blockade of TNFa signaling fully prevented the alterations of sEPSCs induced by microglia , suggesting that , at least in vitro , the synaptic effects of microglia are mostly mediated by the TNFa released.35 It is likely , however , that in the in vivo condition , activated microglial cells exert a more complex neuromodulatory action , as they are able to release glutamate itself , 72 together with many other secreted molecules such as IFNg and IL-1b , which can further modulate the sensitivity of both AMPA and NMDA receptors to their endogenous ligand.49,50,64,65 Role of Inflammatory Cytokines in Neuronal Damage The inflammatory milieu has often been regarded as tout court hostile to neural cells , and proinflammatory cytokines are considered toxic for neurons and oligodendrocytes . This view has been challenged by newly introduced concepts such as the protective autoimmunity73 and the shift of sense of cytokines during the inflammatory reaction74 underlying the existence of a tissue-protective role for cytokines during recovery from neuroinflammation . Still , at least during the acute phase , where the inflammatory reaction has the main aim of eliminating the alien from the target tissue , the damaging role of cytokines prevails . To this respect , TNFa is paradigmatic . Astrocytes activated by TNFa induce apoptotic oligodendroglial death in vivo75 and , in turn , activate the cerebral endothelium . Microglial cells produce TNFa in the CNS and express as many other CNS cell types including oligodendrocytes , both p75 and p55 receptors.76 It is in fact believed that in these cells TNFa acts as an autocrine-paracrine growth factor . Brain endothelial cells do not produce TNFa but express both the p75 and p55 receptors , 77 which , when engaged , determine increased expression of adhesion molecules , 78 or determine the release of soluble factors i.e. , prostaglandin E2 active in the brain parenchyma.79 In the white matter , however , TNFa is also capable of exerting beneficial effects in experimental MS , as it promotes remyelination by stimulating the proliferative activity of oligodendrocyte precursor cells through TNFa-receptor-2.80 A neurotoxic role has also been indicated for other prototypical cytokines such as IL-1b , IL6 and IFNg , 81 although it is unclear whether this effect is direct or mediated by other molecules such as reactive oxygen species or glutamate . Role of Arc Arg3.1 Gene in CNS-confined Inflammation and Synaptic Changes The immediate early gene Arc Arg3.1 is found in the postsynaptic area where it is able to regulate the AMPA receptor trafficking82 and to contribute to the longer phases of LTP.83 Several lines of evidence suggest that its expression is under the control of both the NMDA and AMPA receptors . Indeed , NMDA receptor activation increases its expression levels , whereas AMPAR activation induces its downregula-tion.84 However , Arc Arg3.1 expression is also controlled by extracellular signals such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor BDNF . Indeed , the Arc Arg3.1 mRNA levels within the granule layer of the dentate gyrus are dramatically upregu-lated on BDNF brain infusion , 85 thus suggesting that diffusible signals may also exert a crucial role in controlling the neuronal function . As the tissue-specific inflammation associated with EAE is characterized by the expression in situ of a broad number of cytokines , we studied whether the expression levels of Arc Arg3.1 may be regulated by these molecules . In a first experiment , we evaluated Arc Arg3.1 mRNA expression levels by using in situ hybridization . In mice with EAE between 20 and 30 d.p.i. , Arc Arg3.1 mRNA levels appeared un-changed within the cerebral cortex and the hippocampus but was dramatically downregulated in the striatum.35 Although the sensitivity of this technique is sufficient to detect small differences in mRNA gene expression , the Arc Arg3.1 mRNA levels were also evaluated by real-time PCR on striatal microdissections . This analysis confirmed the previous result and showed an approximately 50 % reduction in the Arc Arg3.1 mRNA levels within striata derived from mice affected by EAE . The inflammatory milieu , which acts within the CNS of mice with EAE , contains a broad number of molecules secreted in part by CNS-infiltrating blood-borne derived cells and in part by activated microglial cells and astrocytes . Thus , we tested whether prototypical Th1 cytokines IFNg , TNFa and IL-1b can modulate the Arc Arg3.1 mRNA expression on primary neuronal cultures . Within a few hours of administration , these cytokines were capable of significantly reducing the Arc Arg3.1 mRNA , suggesting a new role for proinflammatory cytokines in controlling the expression of an immediate early gene . The dramatic downregulation of Arc Arg3.1 seen in EAE as a consequence of the proinflammatory release by activated microglia prompted us to hypothesize an active role of this early gene in controlling synaptic transmission during experi-mental MS . Our hypothesis was supported by several lines of evidence . Both the mRNA encoded by the Arc Arg3.1 gene and the Arc protein accumulate in dendritic spines , where they interact with actin in the control of synaptic transmission.86 The interaction of Arc with dynamin and endophilin , two proteins known to have a role in endocytosis , has also been described.82 Arc and endophilin associate with vesicles that traffic AMPA receptors , and expression of Arc transgene increases the rate of surface AMPA receptor endocytosis and reduces the level of surface AMPA recep-tors.87 Furthermore , Arc reduces AMPA-mediated sEPSCs , whereas Arc Arg3.1 overexpression results in a cell-wide decrease in the surface expression of GluR1-containing AMPA receptors.87 By controlling the strength of AMPA-mediated excitatory transmission , Arc expression has an essential role in the induction of homeostatic plasticity , 87,88 a form of long-term synaptic adaptation believed to compensate for Hebbian forms of plasticity LTP and LTD , by scaling neuronal output without changing the relative strength of individual synapses.89 All these data might indicate that the alterations of sEPSCs seen in mice with EAE during Arc Arg3.1 downregulation and in response to TNFa reflect the induction of homeostatic plasticity mechanisms , and establishes a strong link between long-lasting synaptic changes and dendritic degeneration in experimental MS . Conclusions The effects of soluble mediators , such as cytokines in controlling synaptic activity , have previously been described variably.61 The consequences for human physiology and pathology are however difficult to extrapolate , despite the extreme interest of these findings . As described above , the effects of T cells , microglia and secreted inflammatory cytokines can in fact be both detrimental and neuroprotective , depending on the duration of the inflammatory process and on its preferential location in the white or gray matter . The case of BDNF appears to be particularly significant in this respect . BDNF is in fact released by activated T cells , microglia and astrocytes in MS lesions , where it promotes remyelination and neuronal and oligodendroglial survival.90�92 On the other hand , increased BDNF release in the gray matter by immune cells and by neurons might favor excitotoxic neuronal damage during the acute phase of neuroinflammatory diseases , as BDNF increases glutamate release93,94 and controls AMPA and NMDA receptor phosphorylation , expression and traffick-ing.95,96 It also favors LTP of excitatory transmission , whereas it preferentially inhibits GABA release.95�97 Together , these findings indicate that BDNF exerts complex and opposite effects in the white and gray matter of patients with MS . According to this conclusion , increased BDNF release has been claimed to mediate the therapeutic effects of MS-specific medications on tissue destruction in white matter inflammatory lesions , 59 whereas MS subjects with impaired BDNF signaling exhibit less severe gray matter atrophy.98 The investigation of the cross-talk between the immune system and neurons using synaptic activity , glutamate excitotoxity , synapse and spine integrity , and neuron-glia interaction as primary readouts has to be taken as a step forward , and put in the context of experimental and human pathology . The results that we have presented in this review article are mainly obtained in a mouse model of MS , but they already have potential clinical consequences , in terms of comprehension of pathogenic mechanisms and in the possible identification of novel therapeutic targets for MS . The synaptopathy that we and others described to be concomitant to , and caused by , neuroinflamation may constitute , when prolonged enough and pushed beyond a possible point of no return , the long searched for link between inflammation and neurodegeneration in chronic diseases of the CNS such as MS . It may also help to explain , along with many other pathological events , the early cognitive deficits seen frequently in some MS patients , and may explain the correlation that has been described5 between the amount of inflammation in the early phases of the disease and the rate of progression in the late , so-called neurodegenerative , phase . We can further speculate that synaptic changes occurring early during immune-mediated inflammatory demyelinating disorders of the CNS � caused by pro-inflammatory molecules released by activated blood-borne or CNS-resident immune cells � might also contribute to limiting plastic compensatory �protective� changes e.g. , driven by developmental molecules or stem precursor cells occurring within neural networks . This can be considered as a contributing phenomenon to foster the transition of CNS-confined inflammatory neurologi-cal disorders into chronic irreversible and progressive neurodegenerative disorders . We firmly believe that new investigations in the forthcoming years will shed further light on the link between inflammation , synaptic transmission and neuronal damage , and that soon these results will be taken to the bedside of patients affected by neuroinflammatory disorders .

19960025	Dual roles of Drosophila p53 differentiation in cell death and cell p53 is a well-known tumor suppressor . Depending on cell type and cellular context , activation of p53 can trigger multiple cellular responses , including cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis reviewed in Vousden and Prives1 . Although p53 functions through several mechanisms , it has been best characterized as a transcription factor that activates target genes including the cyclin-dependent kinase CDK inhibitor p21 and the pro-apoptotic genes Puma and Noxa.1 In addition , p63 and p73 , two p53 paralogs , have been identified in vertebrates reviewed in Pietsch et al.2 and Stiewe3 . They can not only induce apoptosis , but also have additional functions because p63 and p73 knockout mice show clear developmental defects , in contrast to p53 -null mice that are viable and develop normally.2,3 The analysis of the p63 phenotype revealed that p63 is required for epithelial stem cell maintenance . In the absence of p63 , these stem cells undergo terminal differentiation and do not remain to sustain the epidermis.4 p63 mice die shortly after birth . The p73 phenotype is more complex , and also includes differentiation defects of certain populations of neurons in the brain . Further complicating is the observation that there are antagonistic p53 family members that are produced from additional intronic promoters generating N-terminally truncated DN isoforms reviewed by Stiewe3 and Murray-Zmijewski et al.4 . The DN isoforms can bind with the full-length transactivating TA isoforms of p53 , p63 and p73 , and antagonize their functions.3,4 Thus , this complexity makes it very difficult to dissect the functional mechanisms of the p53 family members in vertebrates . It is therefore attractive to examine the ancestral function of p53 orthologs in invertebrates such as Drosophila . The Drosophila genome contains a single p53 family member , referred to as Drosophila p53 Dp53 .5�7 Similar to mammalian p53 , Dp53-null mutant flies are viable and fertile , and with the exception of an apoptotic defect of primordial germ cells , they have no obvious developmental defects.8,9 In contrast to mammalian p53 , Dp53 appears unable to induce radiation-induced cell-cycle arrest.5,6,8 Similarly , mammalian cells lacking p63 and p73 are also unable to induce DNA damage-induced cell-cycle arrest.10 Consequently , Dp53 and various forms of irradiation do not induce the expression of the Drosophila p21 homolog , dacapo dap .8,11 Importantly , the pro-apoptotic function of p53 is well conserved in Drosophila . In response to apoptotic stimuli , the pro-apoptotic genes reaper rpr , head involution defective hid and grim are both necessary and sufficient to induce apoptosis through inhibition of the caspase inhibitor Diap1 , which subsequently leads to activation of the initiator caspase , Drosophila Nedd2-like caspase Dronc , and two major effector caspases , Drosophila interleukin-1 converting enzyme DrICE and death caspase-1 Dcp-1 reviewed by Xu et al.12 . In response to radiation-induced DNA damage , Dp53 activates the transcription of rpr to initiate apoptosis.6 In this process , hid is also induced , but the details are less clear.8,11,13 Expression of Dp53 in developing Drosophila eyes induces massive cell death.5,7 However , the Dp53-induced eye phenotype can not be completely blocked by expression of p35 , a potent inhibitor of DrICE and Dcp-1,5 suggesting that an effector caspase-independent mechanism of Dp53-induced apoptosis may exist in Drosophila . There is precedence for a potential caspase-independent function of p53 . Overexpression of the C. elegans p53 homolog cep-1 caused wide-spread cell death independently of caspase activation.14 In this study we further examined the phenotypes obtained by expression of Dp53 in Drosophila eyes . We show by mutant analysis that only hid , but not rpr , is required for Dp53-induced apoptosis in this system . In addition , expression of Dp53 can activate the canonical caspase-dependent apop-tosis pathway in Drosophila . Consistently , and in contrast to previous reports , we found that p35 can block cell death induced by expression of Dp53 . However , inhibition of apoptosis does not rescue the Dp53-induced rough and small adult eye phenotype . We show that expression of Dp53 causes differentiation defects of various cell types , including photoreceptor neurons and cone cells , independently of its pro-apoptotic function . These differentiation defects imply that Dp53 may also have genetic features of mammalian p63 and p73 proteins . Intriguingly , expression of the p53 target gene , human p21 , or its Drosophila homolog dap can suppress Dp53-induced cell death as well as cell differentiation defects . These findings reveal that Dp53 incorporates functions of multiple mammalian p53 family members and provide new insights into the pathways activated by Dp53 . Results Expression of Dp53 induces cell death through the canonical apoptosis pathway in Drosophila eyes . Expression of Dp53 in the fly eye either directly under control of the eye-specific glass multimer reporter GMR promoter GMR�Dp53 or using a modified upstream activating sequence UAS -Gal4 system GMR-Gal4 GMR UAS GUS �Dp53 referred to as GMR4GUS�Dp53 8 induces small and rough eyes with glossy appearance Figures 1a�c .5,7,8 This eye ablation phenotype is induced specifically by Dp53 as it can be fully rescued by co-expression of a dominant-negative form of Dp53 , Dp53H159N see Ollmann et al.5 , or by Dp53 RNAi data not shown . It has been reported that the eye ablation phenotype of GMR�Dp53 can not be rescued by co-expression of the caspase inhibitor p35 , an inhibitor of the effector caspases DrICE and Dcp-15 see Figure 2h . This observation may suggest that GMR�Dp53 causes the eye ablation phenotype independently of caspase activation . Therefore , we examined the pro-apoptotic function of Dp53 in more detail . First , we labeled GMR�Dp53 and GMR4GUS�Dp53 eye imaginal discs from late third instar larvae with an antibody detecting activated caspases cleaved caspase-3 Cas3* . The obtained labeling pattern Figures 1d�f resembles the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling TUNEL pattern in these discs Figures 1g�i and corres-ponds to the expression domain of GMR.15 Therefore , Dp53 can induce caspase activation . Next , we asked whether the three major pro-apoptotic genes , rpr , hid and grim , are required for Dp53-induced cell death . Deficiency 3L H99 Df 3L H99 referred to as H99 , which deletes these three genes , 16 was used for mosaic analysis . In late third instar GMR4GUS�Dp53 eye discs , Dp53-induced cell death , as detected by TUNEL , is com-pletely blocked in H99 mutant clones arrows , Figure 2a , a0 . Furthermore , Dp53-induced cell death is also absent in mutant clones of the initiator caspase dronc Figure 2b , b0 or its adaptor ark Figure 2c , c0 , which encode the apop-tosome components of the canonical apoptotic pathway.17�21 These results indicate that the canonical Drosophila apoptotic pathway indeed mediates GMR�Dp53-induced cell death . We next asked why expression of the caspase inhibitor p35 does not suppress the GMR�Dp53-induced eye phenotype5 Figure 2h and examined whether expression of p35 can block Dp53-induced apoptosis at the cellular level . Strikingly , simultaneous expression of p35 and Dp53 under control of the same GMR�GAL4 driver strongly inhibits Dp53-induced apoptosis in the developing eye disc Figure 2d , d0 . The suppression of Dp53 by p35 is not restricted to eye imaginal discs and can also be observed in wing imaginal discs Supplementary Figure S1 . Taken together , these data suggest that Dp53 activity triggers apoptosis through the canonical apoptotic pathway , including pro-apoptotic genes and activated caspases . Intriguingly , we also noticed that although GMR�Dp53-induced cell death is completely blocked in H99 , dronc or ark mutant clones , and is strongly suppressed by expression of p35 , the resulting adult eyes are not or only partially rescued , as indicated by their rough and glossy appearance compare Figures 2e�h with Figures 1b and c . This is in striking contrast to the strong suppression of the GMR-hid-and GMR-reaper-induced eye ablation phenotypes by loss of dronc and ark , or expression of p35.22�26 Therefore , this analysis raises two questions . First , which of the H99 genes , rpr , hid or grim , are required for caspase activation and apoptosis in GMR�Dp53 eye discs ? Second , why is the eye ablation phenotype of GMR�Dp53 not rescued when apoptosis is blocked ? Hid is the major effector of Dp53-induced apoptosis in the Drosophila eye . To examine which pro-apoptotic genes mediate GMR�Dp53-induced apoptosis , we first examined the expression of hid in GMR�Dp53 eye discs . Compared with wild-type eye discs Figure 3a�a000 , the protein level of Hid is strongly increased in the area in which GMR drives expression of Dp53 and apoptosis Figure 3b , b00 see also Figure 2d . Because Dp53 encodes a transcription factor , we tested whether this increase of Hid protein is due to increased hid transcription using a hid-lacZ reporter transgene see Material and Methods . In GMR�Dp53 eye discs , hid is indeed transcriptionally induced Figure 3b , b000 . hid expression in response to Dp53 was not only present in developing eye discs but was also found in wing discs Supplementary Figure S2b , b0 when compared with controls Supplementary Figure S2a . Because rpr has been shown to be a direct target of Dp53 in response to X-ray-induced DNA damage , 6 we also analyzed expression of rpr in GMR�Dp53 . However , high background expression levels of the rprXRE-lacZ X-ray response element XRE reporter transgene prevented us from assessing rpr expression in eye discs data not shown . Nevertheless , we were able to detect increased reporter expression of the rprXRE-lacZ transgene upon expression of Dp53 in wing discs Supplementary Figure S2d , d0 compared with controls Supplementary Figure S2c . Therefore , both hid and rpr are transcriptionally induced by Dp53 in imaginal eye and wing discs . From the H99 mutant analysis Figure 2a , we know that one or more of the H99 genes are important for GMR�Dp53-induced apoptosis . To identify which gene is required for Dp53-induced apoptosis , we tested individual mutants . Surprisingly , loss of rpr by using a combination of deletions H99 Df 3L XR38 , 27 or a null mutant of rpr , rpr87 see Moon et al.13 , did not significantly affect the level of GMR�Dp53-induced apoptosis Figure 3c , c0 and d , d0 . In contrast , null mutants of hid suppress most of GMR�Dp53-induced cell death Figure 3e , e0 indicating that Hid is the primary mediator of apoptosis induced by GMR-Dp53 . GMR�Dp53 causes cell differentiation defects indepen-dently of its apoptotic function . Although GMR�Dp53 induces apoptosis mainly through hid and its downstream canonical apoptotic pathway , the adult GMR�Dp53 eye phenotype can not be rescued by blocking the apoptotic pathway compare Figures 2e�h with Figures 1b and c . It is therefore reasonable to examine whether eye-specific expression of Dp53 can cause developmental defects other than apoptosis . It has been suggested that Dp53 expression may also cause differentiation defects.28 To analyze this possibility , we examined differentiation of various cell types in Dp53-expressing eye discs by using the cellular differentiation markers Embryonic Lethal Abnormal Vision ELAV labels all photoreceptor neurons R1�R8 , Rough Ro R2�R5 and Seven-up Svp R2 , R5 , R1 and R6 . The expression of these differentiation markers in wild-type and GMR�Dp53 eye discs is shown in Supplementary Figure S3 . Although differentiated photoreceptor neurons are slightly disorganized at the late larval stage , differentiation of all types of photoreceptor neurons , as visualized by these differentiation markers , appears largely normal in GMR� Dp53 Supplementary Figure S3b�b0 . In contrast , the numbers of R7 photoreceptor neurons and cones cells labeled by the markers Prospero Pros and Cut , respec-tively , are strongly reduced compared with wild type Figures 4a�d0 . Therefore , expression of Dp53 under control of the GMR promoter affects differentiation of R7 and cone cells . To further examine the differentiation defect , GMR�Dp53 pupal eye discs were analyzed . In pupal GMR�Dp53 eye discs , ommatidia are severely misorganized , as indicated by enlarged interommatidial space , ommatidial fusions arrows , Figure 4f and reduced number of cone cells in each ommatidium . Altogether , these data indicate that GMR�Dp53 causes differentiation defects in developing Drosophila eyes . Because Dp53 induces apoptosis , we wondered whether these differentiation defects are caused by the pro-apoptotic function of Dp53 , and analyzed cell differentiation in Dp53-expressing , but apoptosis-deficient , background . In control experiments , inhibition of apoptosis in otherwise wild-type background does not affect cell differentiation data not shown . Although cell death is blocked in H99 or dronc mutant tissues see Figures 2a , and b and 5b , R7 photoreceptor differentiation is not rescued in GMR�Dp53 eye discs Figure 5a , b0 . Similar results were obtained during pupal development Figures 5c�e0 . This analysis suggests that expression of Dp53 causes differentiation defects indepen-dently of its pro-apoptotic role . Next , we analyzed why differentiation of R7 and cone cells was affected by GMR�Dp53 , but not that of other photo-receptor neurons . R7 and cone cells are the last cell types to be specified in the larval eye disc . In contrast , photoreceptors R8 , R2 , R3 , R4 and R5 are specified earlier at around the time when GMR induces expression of Dp53 . Thus , it is possible that Dp53 is expressed too late to block differentiation of photoreceptor neurons R8 and R2�R5 . We examined this possibility by inducing Dp53-expressing clones at earlier stages . To block Dp53-induced apoptosis and thus to obtain Dp53-expressing clones , the caspase inhibitor p35 was expressed simultaneously with Dp53 . Under these conditions , all types of photoreceptor neurons as indicated by ELAV labeling are missing in Dp53 p35-expressing tissues arrows , -Figure 5f�f000 . Expression of p35 alone does not affect photoreceptor and cone cell differentiation data not shown . Thus , these observations suggest that Dp53 can only block differentiation if it is expressed before the onset of differentia-tion . In summary , these data show that expression of Dp53 can interfere with differentiation of all cell types in developing Drosophila eyes independently of its pro-apoptotic function . Human p21 and Drosophila Dap suppress both GMR� Dp53-induced apoptosis and cell differentiation defects . It has been reported that expression of human p21 can suppress Dp53-induced apoptosis in Drosophila.5 Because we showed above that Dp53-induced cell differentiation defects and apoptosis are independent of each other see above , we further examined whether and how human p21 can rescue GMR�Dp53-induced phenotypes in more detail . Expression of p21 under GMR control GMR�p21 causes a rough eye phenotype due to decreased cell proliferation Figure 6a .29 GMR�p21 does not or only mildly induce cell death and does not affect photoreceptor differentiation Figures 6b and c . Consistently with previous observations , GMR�p21 suppresses GMR� Dp53-induced apoptosis in larval eye discs Figure 6e . More importantly , in contrast to p35 , GMR�p21 rescues both the R7 differentiation defect in larval eye discs and the eye ablation phenotype of GMR�Dp53 adults Figures 6d and f . Similarly , although to a lesser extent , expression of the Drosophila homolog of p21 , dacapo dap , 30,31 also suppre-sses both Dp53-induced cell death and cell differentiation defects Figures 6g�i . As described above , because expression of Dp53 induces expression of the apoptotic gene hid , we examined whether GMR�p21 can modulate GMR�Dp53-induced expression of hid . Indeed , the protein level of Hid is reduced when human p21 is co-expressed in Dp53-expressing eyes compare Figure 6j with Figure 3b000 . This observation suggests that p21 interferes with Dp53 upstream of hid to suppress Dp53-induced apoptosis in Drosophila Figure 6k . Discussion In this study , we used the developing Drosophila eye as an in vivo model to analyze the function of Dp53 at the cellular level . Our study makes three important points . First , Hid is the major effector of GMR�Dp53-induced apoptosis , trigger-ing the canonical caspase-dependent apoptotic pathway . Second , Dp53 induces differentiation defects of all cell types in the eye . This activity is independent of the pro-apoptotic role of Dp53 , and reminiscent of mammalian p63 and p73 . Third , these dual roles of Dp53 can be inhibited by expression of human p21 or its Drosophila homolog dap . In the following , we discuss these observations in detail . Hid is the major effector of GMR�Dp53-induced apoptosis . Previous studies of radiation-induced cell death have shown that the pro-apoptotic genes rpr and hid are transcriptionally induced by Dp53.6,8,11,32,33 The fast induction within 30 min of hid and rpr suggested that they may be direct targets of Dp53.8 A radiation-responsive enhancer containing a typical p53-binding consensus site was identified in the upstream regulatory region of rpr.6 GMR�Dp53 induces reporter expression from the same radiation-responsive enhancer , suggesting that induction of rpr by Dp53 is independent of context . However , despite expression of rpr , loss of rpr does not significantly influence GMR�Dp53-induced apoptosis . In contrast , complete loss of hid significantly abrogated GMR�Dp53-induced apoptosis , suggesting that Hid is the major mediator of GMR�Dp53 . This is consistent with previous findings that heterozygosity of hid partially suppresses radiation-induced apoptosis.8 Therefore , it seems that Dp53 � whether its expression is induced by irradiation or by the heterologous GMR promoter � induces apoptosis by similar molecular mechanisms . It is unclear why hid has a more important role in GMR� Dp53-induced apoptosis than rpr in this system . Simple expression of rpr may not be sufficient for apoptosis induction and additional activation may be required . However , this possibility seems unlikely because expression of rpr from the GMR promoter is sufficient to induce apoptosis.34 Alterna-tively , the developing eye may be more prone to hid-induced apoptosis because those cells that die by developmental apoptosis in the eye die primarily by hid-induced apoptosis.35 Such a tissue-specific requirement has also been reported for rpr , which is required for apoptosis of abdominal neuroblasts in the central nervous system.27 Thus , it will be interesting to analyze the pro-apoptotic requirements of Dp53 in other tissues including neuroblasts . Dp53 has a conserved function in regulating cell differentiation . Our analysis indicates that Dp53 blocks cell differentiation of photoreceptor neurons and cone cells independently of its pro-apoptotic role . Interestingly , Dp53 can only block differentiation if it is expressed before the onset of differentiation . Notably , p53 , p63 and p73 have also been implicated in the control of cell differentiation reviewed in Vousden and Prives1 and Stiewe3 . However , in the cases reported , the expression of the p53 family members in undifferentiated cells actually induces differentiation instead of inhibiting it , as shown in this study for Dp53 . For example , the TA isoform of mouse p53 induces differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells.3,4 Nevertheless , the antago-nizing DN isoforms of p63 and p73 have been found to promote stem cell proliferation . For example , DNp63 is highly expressed in epidermal stem cells , and loss of p63 triggers these cells to terminally differentiate , suggesting that DNp63 inhibits differentiation reviewed in Stiewe3 and Murray-Zmijewski et al.4 . Similarly , expression of DNp73 inhibits myogenic differentiation.3,4 DNp63 and DNp73 can also interfere with p53-induced differentiation programs.3,4 Importantly , the Dp53 gene also has an internal promoter36 and the originally identified Dp53 gene , including the one used in this study , actually corresponds to the DN isoform of Dp53.36 Therefore , our finding that expression of Dp53 suppresses cell differentiation is consistent with the inhibitory role of DN isoforms in cell differentiation . Therefore , Dp53 has similar genetic properties to mammalian DNp63 and DNp73 isoforms . This statement is also supported by the observation that mammalian cells lacking p63 and p73 are unable to induce DNA damage-induced cell-cycle arrest , 10 similar to Dp53 . However , both mammalian p53 and Drosophila Dp53 lack the sterile alpha motif SAM domain at the C-terminus , which is characteristic for p63 and p73.37 The SAM domain supports oligomerization of p63 and p73 . The absence of the SAM domain may indicate that Dp53 is more related with mammalian p53 rather than with p63 and p73 . Nevertheless , BLAST searches with Dp53 revealed higher similarity with mammalian p63 and p73 than with p53.37 Furthermore , it was recently shown that the SAM domain of Dp53 was replaced during evolution by a helix domain , which also supports oligomerization.38 Thus , both genetically and functionally , Dp53 resembles p63 and p73 more than p53 . p21 and Dacapo antagonize an early step of Dp53 activation . Depending on the cell type , expression of human p21 can suppress p53-induced apoptosis reviewed by Janicke et al.39 . Because after DNA damage p53 induces cell-cycle arrest through induction of p21 , it is thought that p21-mediated suppression of p53-induced apoptosis would give cells the opportunity to repair damaged DNA first , before induction of apoptosis , depending on the extent of DNA damage.39 We extend these observations further and show in this study that human p21 not only suppresses Dp53-induced apoptosis , but also suppresses the Dp53-induced block of cell differentiation . Remarkably , the suppression of Dp53-induced phenotypes is more efficient by human p21 than by Drosophila Dap . It is surprising that this control of Dp53 activity is conserved in flies , given that Dp53 is not required for radiation-induced cell-cycle arrest and also does not induce dap expression.5,6,8,11 However , the fact that Dap exerts at least some anti-Dp53 activity suggests that human p21 did not acquire this activity recently in evolution . It rather seems that Dap may have partially lost it because it is not induced by Dp53 and thus there was no selective pressure for Dap to maintain its anti-Dp53 activity during evolution , and hence the weaker suppression . The molecular mechanisms by which p21 suppresses p53-induced apoptosis are unclear and somewhat contradictory reviewed in Janicke et al.39 . According to several studies , the anti-apoptotic function of p21 seems to be mediated through binding and inhibition of caspase-3 , apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 ASK1 , Jun kinase JNK , p38 and CDKs.39 However , our study provides three lines of evidence that p21-mediated suppression of Dp53 occurs upstream of hid expression . First , the Dp53-induced block of cell differ-entiation , which is independent of hid , is suppressed by p21 . Second , Dp53-induced expression of hid is strongly reduced by p21 . Finally , the apoptotic phenotype of GMR-hid is not affected by co-expression of p21 data not shown . Thus , these data support the notion that p21 and Dap suppress GMR�Dp53 upstream of hid . p21 does not affect the protein levels of Dp53 in GMR�Dp53 data not shown , suggesting that p21 does not interfere with Dp53 expression , translation or stability . Because p21 suppresses Dp53 at a very early step and because Dp53 is thought to directly bind to the hid promoter , 8 we would suggest that p21 directly interferes with the ability of Dp53 to induce gene expression . Alternatively , it is also possible that the suppression of Dp53 by p21 is indirect , and that Dp53 requires a cell-cycle-competent environment for hid expression . Further studies are needed to clarify these questions . In summary , these findings reveal that Dp53 incorporates functions of multiple mammalian p53 family members and provide new insights into the pathways activated by Dp53 . It will now be interesting to identify the mechanisms by which Dp53 inhibits cell differentiation and how p21 overcomes it . Materials and Methods Fly strains and crosses .

Generation of the hid-lacZ and rprXRE-lacZ reporter lines hid-lacZ . The 30 kb genomic DNA upstream of the hid start site was cloned in three parts with approximately 10 kb each and a small region of overlap around 100�200 bp . These three DNA fragments were then cloned and inserted into a Drosophila reporter plasmid , pCaSpeR-hs43-lacZ , respectively . Each reporter construct was named based on the distance upstream of the hid start site , for example , hid20 10-lacZ contains regulatory DNA 10�20 kb upstream of the start site . Transgenic flies were then generated using standard procedures . The hid20 10-lacZ reporter was found to respond in GMR�Dp53 eye discs Figure 3b and was used in this study as the hid reporter . rprXRE-lacZ .

20010783	Cell death is essential for the elimination of unwanted or harmful cells during development , homeostasis and pathogenesis . Apoptosis is morphologically characterized by nuclear shrinkage and fragmentation , cellular condensation , membrane blebbing , formation of apoptotic bodies and activation of caspases.1 Research during the last decade clearly illustrates the important contribution of alternative forms of cell death in development and homeostasis.2 For a long time , necrosis has been considered an uncontrolled form of cell death , but accumulating evidence shows that necrotic cell death is carried out by complex signal trans-duction pathways and execution mechanisms.3,4 In vitro , necrosis is morphologically characterized by rounding of the cell , cytoplasmic swelling oncosis , presence of dilated organelles and absence of chromatin condensation.1,4 Necroptosis refers to a regulated form of necrosis , which is biochemically defined as a form of cell death that is dependent on the serine�threonine kinase receptor-interacting protein 1 RIP1 .4�6 The patho physiological relevance of necroptosis has been underestimated for a long time because of the absence of a defined biochemical marker . This has now changed with the identification of necrostatins.1,6 Using the RIP1 inhibitor , necrostatin-1 Nec-1 , 7,8 the contribution of necroptosis has been demonstrated in a wide range of pathological cell death events , such as ischemic brain injury , myocardial infarction , excitotoxicity and chemotherapy-induced cell death.8 RIP3 , which functions in close concert with RIP1 , was recently shown to be required for tumor necrosis factor TNF -induced necroptosis when apoptotic signaling is blocked.9 Apparently , RIP3 activates glycolysis-and glutaminolysis-enhancing bioenergetics , with concomi-tant complex I-mediated reactive oxygen species ROS production.9 Other mediators of TNF-induced necroptosis are calcium , ceramide , cytosolic phospholipase A2 cPLA2 and lysosomal membrane permeabilization LMP .4 Severe oxidative stress has also been associated with LMP and consequent necrosis.10 Extracellular application of 0.01�1 mM peroxide is physiologically relevant and broadly mimics the release of endogenous H2O2.11 For example , activated neutrophils generate up to 6 10 14 mol H2O2 h per cell , generating a local concentration of 10�100 mM H2O2.12 Lysosomes , which are rich in free iron and lack enzymes for H2O2 degradation , favor Fenton-type-mediated generation of reactive hydroxyl radicals.13 This formation of hydroxyl radicals results in enhanced lipid peroxidation of membranes , and consequent LMP.14 Scavenging iron in therapy , using metal-protein-attenuating compounds , has been proven to be beneficial in neurodegenerative diseases , thereby making inhibition of LMP and consequent necrosis an interesting therapeutic strategy.15 The different subcellular events in necrotic signaling are elusive . Therefore , this study analyzed , by high-resolution live-cell imaging , the occurrence of ROS generation , changes in mitochondrial transmembrane potential MTP , LMP and plasma membrane permeabilization PMP during TNF-mediated necroptosis , H2O2-induced necrosis and anti-Fas-mediated secondary necrosis in the same cellular context , that is , in L929sAhFas cells . Results ROS production during TNF-induced necroptosis and H2O2-induced necrosis . A comparative morphological ana-lysis of TNF-induced necroptosis and H2O2-induced necrosis in L929sAhFas cells by time-lapse imaging confirmed the absence of apoptotic features . Instead , we observed that both stimuli induced rounding of the cell , followed by cellular swelling and granulation of the cytoplasm . Finally , the plasma membrane gets an inflated �balloon-like� appearance on its rupture Supplementary Figure 1a�h . In both TNF-and H2O2-induced cell death , no caspase activity was detected , in contrast to anti-Fas-induced apoptosis Supplementary Figure 1i and j . TNF-and H2O2-induced cell death elicits intracellular oxidative stress , which is monitored using CM-H2DCFDA as a probe in live-cell imaging . In parallel , PMP was determined by propidium iodide PI uptake and taken as a reference end point in all experiments . On TNF stimulation , ROS generation gradually increased without major morphological changes Figure 1a and b , between points t1 and t3 , Supplementary video 1a , followed by an oxidative burst before PMP . In contrast , in H2O2-induced necrosis , the onset of an oxidative burst occurred more rapidly Figure 1c and d , Supplementary video 2a . In both conditions , the beginning of the ROS peak coincided with the initiation of typical necrotic features , such as rounding and swelling of cells Figure 1a , Supplementary video 1b and Figure 1c , Supplementary video 2b . None of the above-mentioned observations were seen in unstimulated cells Supplementary Figure 2a . Conclusively , TNF elicits a modest increase in ROS production during the signaling phase , which is followed by an oxidative burst coinciding with Fluorescence Fluorescence 40 40 30 30 20 t3 20 the cellular disintegration phase , whereas H2O2 induces a high level of ROS generation starting shortly after H2O2 treatment . Mitochondrial transmembrane potential in TNF-induced necroptosis and H2O2-induced necrosis . Another typical biochemical event during cell death is modulation of MTP . Reduction of MTP is an early event in apoptosis.16 In TNF-induced necroptosis , however , increased MTP has been reported.17 To follow the changes in MTP during TNF-and H2O2-induced cell death , cells were loaded with TMRM , which is sequestered by actively respiring mitochondria , and analyzed by time-lapse microscopy . PMP was determined by SYTOX Green uptake . In agreement with Goossens et al. , 17 we observed hyper-polarization of mitochondria with biphasic kinetics Figure 2a and b , points t2�t6 , starting shortly before the onset of cellular rounding Supplementary video 3a and b . In contrast , H2O2 caused immediate hyperpolarization that rapidly returned to baseline Figure 2c and d , Supplementary video 4a and b . None of the above-mentioned observations were seen in non-dying cells Supplementary Figure 2b . Therefore , we conclude that both forms of necrotic cell death exhibit mitochondrial hyperpolarization , although with different kinetics . Lysosomal membrane permeabilization during TNF-induced necroptosis and H2O2-induced necrosis . As LMP has been reported as a crucial event during apoptosis and necrosis , 14 we next analyzed lysosomal integrity using LysoTracker Red DND-99 . During TNF-induced necroptosis , the onset of the typical oncosis morphology coincided with the start of LMP Figure 3a and b , point t4 , Supplementary video 5a and b , just after the onset of mitochondrial hyperpolarization Figure 2a and before oxidative burst Figure 1a . In contrast , on addition of H2O2 , lysosomes rapidly started to leak Figure 3c and d , Supplementary video 6a and b , which persists longer than in TNF-induced 60 t3 10 Mean t1 necroptosis . No LMP was seen when monitoring unstimulated cells Supplementary Figure 2c . These data demonstrate that lysosomal disruption is a late event in TNF-induced necroptosis and an early event in H2O2-induced necrosis . demonstrate that TNF-induced necroptosis and H2O2-induced necrosis are characterized by LMP , mitochondrial hyperpolarization , oxidative burst and PMP , but they occur with different kinetics . Apoptosis is characterized by a caspase-dependent signaling phase and a burial phase during which apoptotic cells are rapidly recognized and taken up by phagocytes . In the absence of phagocytic capacity , apoptotic cells proceed to secondary necrosis characterized by the same features of necrotic cell death.18 Therefore , we examined whether the subcellular events described ROS production , mitochondrial hyperpolarization and LMP during secondary necrosis . The above results above also occurs during secondary necrosis after anti-Fas-mediated apoptosis in L929sAhFas cells . Secondary necrosis , similar to primary necrosis , is characterized by oxidative burst Figure 4a , Supplementary video 7 , mito-chondrial hyperpolarization Figure 4b , points t1�t2 , Supple-mentary video 8 and LMP Figure 4c , Supplementary video 9 . Differential roles of RIP1 , mitochondrial complex I and cPLA2 during different types of necrosis . The kinase activity of RIP1 is crucial for death receptor-induced necrosis.19,20 Moreover , it has been reported that H2O2-induced necrosis is also reduced in RIP1-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts MEF .21 Using RNA interference , we confirmed the importance of RIP1 in TNF-induced necroptosis , but we did not observe any effect on H2O2-induced necrosis or on anti-Fas-induced secondary necrosis Figure 5a . Nec-1 , a chemical compound that directly 100 cells 80 PI 20 100 80 cells PI 20 % SYTOX Green TMRM siCtrl siRIP1 H2O2 TNF anti-Fas H2O2 TNF inhibits RIP1 kinase activity , 1,6 completely blocked TNF-induced necroptosis in L929sAhFas Figure 5b and Supple-mentary Figure 3f and MEF cells Supplementary Figure 4a . In contrast , Nec-1 did not affect H2O2-induced necrosis or anti-Fas-induced secondary necrosis Figure 5b , Supplementary Figures 3d�e and 4b . Studies have reported that necrotic killing of L929 cells by TNF involves mitochondrial complex I-mediated ROS produc-tion22 and cPLA2 activity.23 Butylated hydroxyanisole BHA efficiently inhibits TNF-induced necrotic cell death but not H2O2-induced necrosis or anti-Fas-induced secondary necrosis Figure 5c , Supplementary Figure 3d�f . Inhibiting cPLA2 by bromoenol lactone BEL or mitochondrial complex I by rotenone substantially delayed the onset of TNF-induced necroptosis , but did not block H2O2-induced necrosis and anti-Fas-induced secondary necrosis Figure 5d�e and Supplementary Figure 3g�l . Instead , cell death was even accelerated when anti-Fas-or H2O2-stimulated cells were treated with rotenone and when H2O2-stimulated cells were incubated with BEL . Knockdown of cPLA2 or a chaperone involved in the assembly of mitochondrial complex I , the NADH dehydrogenase ubiquinone 1-a subcomplex assem-bly factor 1 NDUFAF1 , resulted in a similar inhibition of TNF-induced necroptosis Supplementary Figure 5c and d , whereas no inhibition was observed in H2O2-induced necrosis and anti-Fas-induced secondary necrosis Supplementary Figure 5a , b and d . In concordance with the data of Kim et al. , 24 inhibition of Nox1 by diphenylene iodonium DPI also significantly delayed TNF-induced necroptosis , whereas it accelerated H2O2-induced necrosis and anti-Fas-induced secondary necrosis Figure 5f and Supplementary Figure 3j�l . Similar results were obtained in TNF-stimulated L929sA cells stably overexpressing CrmA L929sACrmA , which is a cell death model for sensitized necroptosis Supplementary Figure 3m .25 We conclude that in contrast to TNF , H2O2-induced necrosis and anti-Fas-induced secondary necrosis in L929sAhFas cells does not rely on RIP1 , cPLA2activity or mitochondrial complex I-dependent ROS production . consecutive LMP are crucial in H2O2-induced necrosis , but not in TNF-induced necroptosis or in anti-Fas-induced secondary necrosis . Indeed , the timing of LMP in TNF-induced necroptosis indicates that it is a late event coinciding with cellular disintegration , as in the case of secondary necrosis Figures 3b and 4c . To confirm this differential induction mechanism of LMP in TNF-induced necroptosis and H2O2-induced necrosis , we analyzed the effect of CA-074-Me , which was shown to block cell death by acting upstream of LMP in a cathepsin B-independent manner.28 This inhibitor significantly blocked TNF-induced necrop-tosis , whereas H2O2-induced necrosis and anti-Fas-induced secondary necrosis remained unaffected Figure 5h and Supplementary Figure 3g�i . In this manner , the differential inhibitory action of both inhibitors , DFO and CA-074-Me , on TNF-induced necroptosis and H2O2-induced necrosis underscores the different induction mechanisms of LMP . Differential role of Fenton-type reactions during different types of necrosis . The previous data clearly show that H2O2-induced necrosis does not rely on RIP1 , mitochondrial complex I-mediated ROS production or cPLA2 . However , the live-cell imaging data above suggest that LMP may have an initiating role in H2O2-induced necrosis . A report by Kurz et al.26 demonstrated that an interaction between H2O2 and redox-active iron ions is required to initiate cellular damage . As intralysosomal iron chelation can protect against H2O2-induced cell death , 27 we analyzed the effect of the iron chelator desferrioxamine DFO on TNF-and H2O2-induced necrosis in L929sAhFas cells . DFO effectively blocked H2O2-induced necrosis , regardless of the concentration of H2O2 used , but did not affect TNF-induced necroptosis or anti-Fas-induced secondary necrosis Figure 5g and Supplementary Figure 3a�c . Similar results on DFO pretreatment were obtained in MEF cells stimulated with TNF or H2O2 Supplementary Figure 4a and b or on using the lipophilic iron chelator salicylaldehyde isonicotinoyl hydrazone SIH instead of DFO Supplementary Figure 6 .27 These observations indicate that Fenton-type reactions and Recent research has uncovered several forms of cell death that are distinct from classical apoptosis.1,5 In this report , we analyzed subcellular events during necroptosis , necrosis and secondary necrosis in the same cellular context by using high-resolution time-lapse imaging . TNF induces a regulated form of necrotic cell death , also called necroptosis , 6 whereas H2O2 elicits necrosis due to physicochemical insult . Fas-mediated apoptosis consists of a highly regulated signaling phase , which , in the absence of phagocytosis , is followed by a cellular disintegration phase called secondary necrosis . To distin-guish the signaling pathways elicited during necroptosis and necrosis , we performed mechanistic studies to resolve the molecular signaling pathways implicated and compared the subcellular events at the level of mitochondria and lysosomes . Comparative analysis of TNF-and H2O2-induced cell death by time-lapse imaging confirmed the absence of apoptotic morphological features . Instead , we observed that both cell death stimuli induced typical necrotic morphological features . In some cell types , moderate concentrations of H2O2 o100 mM induce apoptosis.10 However , we were unable to detect caspase activity or apoptotic morphology at any cytotoxic concentration of H2O2 Supplementary Figure 1i and j , data not shown . It should be noted that zVAD-fmk did not sensitize cells for H2O2 treatment , in contrast to its effect on TNF-induced necroptosis Supplementary Figure 1k and l , indicating the implication of distinct necrotic signaling pathways between TNF and H2O2 . This is in contrast to previous studies reporting that in MEF cells both TNF-and H2O2-induced necrosis rely on RIP1.21 However , in our study , RIP1-deficient MEF cells are indeed protected against TNF-induced necroptosis , but do not exhibit altered sensitivity to H2O2-induced necrosis compared with wild-type MEF cells Supplementary Figure 7 . Moreover , addition of Nec-1 , a RIP1 kinase inhibitor , 7 did not protect primary MEF cells against the cytotoxic activity of H2O2 , but attenuated TNF-induced necroptosis Supplementary Figure 4 . These results demonstrate that in L929sAhFas and MEF cells , H2O2-induced necrosis , in contrast to TNF-induced necroptosis , is RIP1 independent . Inhibitors of mitochondrial complex I , cPLA2 and Nox1 , retard TNF-induced necroptosis , pointing to the involvement of mitochondrial , membrane and lysosomal subcellular compartments in necrotic cell death.29 In this respect , there is extensive documentation that mitochondrial complex I-mediated ROS production contributes to necroptosis.22,30,31 The multiple effects of BHA as a mitochondrial complex I inhibitor , oxygen radical scavenger and cPLA2 inhibitor explain its strong antinecrotic effects on TNF-induced necroptosis.30 BHA also completely abrogated zVAD-fmk-mediated sensitization of mice to TNF lethality.32 In contrast , H2O2-induced necrosis occurs independently of the above-mentioned signaling pathways . Our time-lapse imaging data demonstrate that lysosomes rapidly start leaking on addition of H2O2 . Preincubation with the iron chelator , DFO , which accumulates in lysosomes after endocytic uptake , 27 comple-tely blocked H2O2-induced necrosis . In contrast , the same treatment hardly affects TNF-induced necroptosis in L929sAhFas and MEF cells , suggesting differential involve-ment of Fenton-type reactions . An attempt to link the described molecular signaling events to individual subcellular biochemical events , that is , LMP , oxidative burst and mitochondrial hyperpolarization , failed because of photo-toxicity . A combination of inhibitor , probes and repetitive light exposure was toxic without the addition of the cell death stimulus , TNF or H2O2 . Therefore , we were unable to address this question . Time-lapse imaging data demonstrate that TNF-induced necroptotic cell death consists of a signaling phase and a cellular disintegration phase . In contrast , H2O2-induced necrosis starts immediately with the cellular disintegration phase . During the signaling phase of TNF-induced necrosis , the gradual increase in ROS formation is most likely dependent on mitochondrial complex I and or Nox1 , because inhibitors of either enzyme significantly retard TNF-induced ROS production and necroptosis.22,24,31 The steady increase in ROS generation in TNF-induced necroptosis is followed by mitochondrial hyperpolarization at the end of the signaling phase , and consequent rounding of cells , LMP and oxidative burst . Mitochondrial hyperpolarization has been attributed to increased oxygen consumption and increased electron flow.17 However , it is also conceivable that RIP1-mediated inhibition of the adenine nucleotide transporter33 results in a reduction in the mitochondrial matrix levels of ADP , leading to a decrease in ATP synthase activity or to its reverse activity . The latter mechanism instead hydrolyzes ATP and pumps protons against the electrochemical gradient to the mitochon-drial inner membrane space , 34 resulting in increased MTP . Apparently , this MTP increase occurs with a biphasic pattern , but the reason for this remains unclear . Generally , the fluorescence of probes that monitor MTP is quenched when accumulating in mitochondria.35 TMRM has been reported to induce intramitochondrial self-quenching at the concentration applied in this study 200 nM .36 Typically , on mitochondrial uncoupling , a transient increase in TMRM fluorescence partially reflects decreased intramitochondrial self-quenching . To exclude the possibility that the monitored increase in MTP is not indicative of an actual decrease , we performed an additional control experiment by treating TMRM-loaded cells with a mitochondrial uncoupler , carbonyl cyanide m-chlor-ophenyl hydrazone CCCP . Using 200 nM of TMRM , a small transient increase of 10 % is observed before the final reduction in the presence of CCCP Supplementary Figure 8a . This initial increase is not observed using 30 nM TMRM Supplementary Figure 8b , confirming the data of Ward et al.36 However , we would like to emphasize that the increase in mean fluorescence observed during necrotic cell death is 10-fold higher than in the case of CCCP . Therefore , we conclude that the observed mitochondrial hyperpolarization is not because of intramitochondrial self-quenching . Schematic representations illustrate the timing of sub-cellular events in TNF-and H2O2-induced necrosis and in Fas-mediated secondary necrosis Figure 6a�c , using PMP as a reference point . In all three types of necrotic cell death , the cellular disintegration phase is characterized by a continuous decrease in LMP until the eventual loss of PMP . Necrosis ? -Fas Lysotracker This gradual LMP coincides with mitochondrial hyperpolariza-tion and a burst of ROS production . The occurrence of secondary necrosis is often regarded as an in vitro artifact because of the absence of phagocytic capacity . However , in extreme cases of extensive apoptosis and insufficient phagocytic capacity in vivo , it may have a patho physiological role . Lysosomal disintegration leading to the release of cathepsins , and oxidative burst may participate in the gene-ration of modified damage-associated molecular patterns DAMPs through proteolysis37 and generation of oxidized products.38 In that respect , the cellular disintegration phase serves as a last life-buoy to attract immune competent cells and to initiate regeneration processes . In conclusion , the cellular disintegration phase of the three types of necrosis necroptosis , necrosis and secondary necrosis is characterized by the same sequence of sub-cellular events , such as LMP , mitochondrial hyperpolari-zation , oxidative burst and eventually PMP . Moreover , the finding that LMP in apoptosis only occurs during the secondary necrosis phase may clarify the debate on the role and timing of LMP in apoptosis . Our time-lapse imaging results indicate that LMP in necroptosis and secondary necrosis is a late process coinciding with the cellular disintegration phase . Therefore , it is unlikely that LMP has an important signaling function during apoptosis itself , but it may contribute to the generation of DAMP molecules . A better understanding of the impact of necrotic signaling pathways and cellular disintegration process in homeostasis and pathophysiology could lead to therapeutic opportunities in immunotherapy and regenerative medicine . The importance of chemical-induced necrosis by oxidative stress is further underscored by the potential use of metal-protein-attenuating compounds in the treatment of patients with chronic anemia or neurodegenerative diseases.15 Materials and Methods Cells .

20019745	Review Adult brain architecture is the result of a complex interaction between genetic developmental programmes and experience-driven plasticity processes.1,2 A large number of studies demon-strated the existence of time windows in early postnatal life , named critical periods CPs , during which neural circuits display a heightened sensitivity to acquire instructive and adaptive signals from the external environment . Various brain regions subserving major behavioural functions e.g. , sensory percep-tion , motor control and language have CPs that occur at different times and are activated and regulated by distinct mechanisms.3,4 The primary visual cortex V1 is a paradigmatic model for studying experience-dependent plasticity . Although the maturation of the visual system starts before eye opening and the initial targeting of neural connections is subjected to either genetic programmes or spontaneous activity , a proper development of the visual system requires sensory experi-ence.5,6 A total absence of sensory input leads to a delay in the functional and anatomical maturation of the visual cortex , which appears immature far beyond the end of the critical period . Adult animals reared in darkness from birth dark rearing , DR display serious physiological deficits in their visual cortex , including reduced orientation and direction tuning , lower cell responsiveness , larger receptive field sizes , altered spontaneous activity , immature ocular dominance OD distribution and lower visual acuity VA .7�10 Ocular dominance plasticity refers to the rapid change in visual cortex physiology resulting from unbalanced inputs from the two eyes . Hubel and Wiesel11,12 first reported in kittens that reducing input from one eye by lid suture monocular deprivation , MD during development dramatically affects the binocularity of V1 , leading to a loss of cortical responses to that eye and an increase in the number of neurons preferentially driven by the open eye . As a direct consequence , the deprived eye becomes amblyopic its VA is strongly reduced and its contrast sensitivity is blunted . The effects of MD and the existence of a CP have been subsequently described in other species of mammals as well , including primates , 13 rabbits , 14 hamsters , 15 rats , 10 mice16 and ferrets.17 In parallel to experiments based on protocols of reduced or altered sensory experience , relevant progress in understand-ing the influence of environmental experience on the deve-lopment , refinement and maintenance of appropriate neural connections has been made possible by paradigms specifi-cally devoted to increasing the quality and intensity of environmental stimulation , such as environmental enrichment EE . EE is defined as �a combination of complex inanimate and social stimulation�.18 Enriched animals are reared in large groups and housed in widely stimulating environments in which a variety of differently shaped objects are present and changed frequently . The goal of EE is to improve the animals� quality of life by providing them with a combination of multi-sensory cognitive stimulation , increased physical activity , enhanced social interactions and by eliciting natural explora-tive behaviours Figure 1 . Hence , in contrast to the approaches based on sensory deprivation , EE is a gain-of-function paradigm allowing the study of the influence elicited by increased levels of environmental stimulation on brain development and plasticity . Environmental enrichment exerts profound effects on the adult central nervous system CNS . A large number of studies highlighted the fact that EE modifies the behaviour of animals , leading to a sensitive improvement in complex cognitive functions , particularly learning and memory , 19 and positively affecting the animal�s emotional and stress reacti-vity.20 Rodents living in EE conditions display increased levels of hippocampal long-term potentiation LTP , a physiological model of synaptic plasticity related to learning and memory.21 This functional improvement is accompanied by prominent changes at the anatomical level , with robust increments in cortical thickness and weight and modifications of neuronal morphology , in terms of increased dendritic arborization , number of dendritic spines , synaptic density and post-synaptic thickening , occurring in several regions of the brain , particularly in the occipital cortex and hippocampus.22 More-over , exposure to EE increases hippocampal neurogenesis and the integration of newly born cells into functional circuits.21 At the molecular level , EE causes a significant change in the expression of a large set of genes involved in neuronal structure , excitability , synaptic transmission and plasticity , 23 modulating the synthesis and secretion of neurotrophic factors throughout the brain and affecting the cholinergic , serotoninergic and noradrenergic systems.24�27 Although EE research has been mostly focused on rodents , similareffects havebeenreportedinseveralspeciesofmammals gerbils , ground squirrels , rabbits , cats and primates .28�32 Influence of EE on Brain Developmental Plasticity Despite the large body of evidence with regard to the effects of EE on the adult brain , until recently , the influence of EE on the developmental physiology and plasticity of the CNS has remained only scarcely investigated . In the past few years , this gap has been considerably filled with a series of studies focusing on the visual system as a paradigmatic model . The most relevant result was the demonstration that EE from birth induces a marked acceleration in the maturation of VA , an effect consistently reported in mice and rats using both electrophysiological and behavioural methods.33�36 The acceleration effect is quite strong , yielding a 1-week advance in the time course of VA maturation with respect to control animals . This functional outcome is accompanied by a precocious decline in the possibility of inducing LTP of layer II�III field potentials after theta-burst stimulation of the white matter WM-LTP in the visual cortex , 34 a well-established in vitro model of developmental plasticity.37 EE also promotes visual system maturation in the absence of visual experience , with DR rats maintained in EE conditions showing a normal VA development and closure of the CP for OD plasticity.38 This indicates that non-visual stimulation counteracts the effects exerted by a complete lack of visual experience from birth . In the auditory system , pre-weaning EE improves spatial localization abilities and enhances directional sensitivity of A1 neurons , 39 whereas it remains unexplored whether exposure to EE conditions induces compensation for the delay in A1 maturation prompted by white noise rearing . It is worth noting that rearing animals in EE during their early phases of life leads to a functional phenotype very similar to that previously reported in transgenic mice overexpressing BDNF in the forebrain.40,41 Indeed , mice raised in EE show increased levels of the BDNF protein in their visual cortex at P7,34,35 revealing the fact that neurotrophin BDNF is one of the crucial factors that underlie EE effects on V1 maturation . In both BDNF overexpressing mice and EE pups , higher BDNF levels were also shown to trigger the maturation of the inhibitory GABAergic system , which , by affecting receptive field development and synaptic plasticity , could determine both the accelerated maturation of VA and the decline of cortical plasticity.34,35,40 Another molecular factor involved in mediating EE effects on visual system development is IGF-I.42 IGF-I expression is higher at P18 in the visual cortex of EE rats compared with non-EE rats . Moreover , exogenous IGF-I supply mimics , whereas blocking IGF-I action prevents the EE effects on VA maturation . The authors observed that inhibitory inter-neurons respond to IGF-1 with a GAD65 increase in their synaptic terminals , suggesting that a possible explanation for the effects of IGF-I on VA development could be an action on the inhibitory GABAergic system.42 BDNF and IGF-I signalling may eventually converge on the activation of intracellular pathways , leading to the phosphory-lation of the transcription factor CREB . The wave of CREB CRE-mediated gene expression in the visual cortex is accelerated in EE mice , and chronic injections of non-EE animals with rolipram , a pharmacological treatment increas-ing the phosphorylation of CREB , partially mimic the EE outcome on VA maturation.34 Thus , activation of the CREB CRE transcription pathway may be one crucial mediator of the EE effects on visual system development . Retina development is also affected by high levels of environmental stimulation . It has been recently reported that DR induces alterations in both the anatomical stratifications of retinal ganglion cells RGCs and the visual responsiveness of inner retinal neurons.43,44 EE accelerates the segregation of RGC dendrites into ON and OFF sublaminae , 36 as well as the rise of retinal acuity during development , even in animals exposed to differential rearing before eye opening , for the first 10 days of life.45 IGF-I and BDNF are key molecular factors in these processes retinal levels of both proteins are precociously increased in the RGC layer of developing EE rats , and blocking either IGF-I or BDNF action in EE animals counteracts the faster retinal maturation.36,45,46 BDNF turned out to be a downstream target of IGF-I.46 Strikingly , the maturation of the nervous system is sensitive to environmental stimulation during prenatal life as well . Recent data by Sale et al.47 demonstrated that exposing pregnant females to EE maternal enrichment profoundly affects the development of the retina in embryos , leading to an acceleration of structural processes critical for retinal matura-tion , such as the migration of neural progenitors and the time course of naturally occurring cell death in the RGC layer . Interestingly , a key factor in the effects of maternal enrichment on retinal morphology and function is IGF-I . Anatomical modifications are indeed accompanied by a marked increase in IGF-I levels in the retinas of EE pups and in maternal milk . Furthermore , IGF-I infusion during late pregnancy is sufficient to induce , in non-EE animals , all the reported changes elicited by EE in foetuses , whereas neutralization of IGF-I in EE mothers prevents the action of maternal enrichment on retinal development.47 The influence of increased maternal stimulation during pregnancy is not only restricted to the visual system . Voluntary wheel running of pregnant mice leads to a twofold increase in hippocampal precursor-cell proliferation in their pups.48 Maternal physical activity in the form of swimming during pregnancy has also been shown to increase hippo-campal BDNF mRNA expression in the offspring leading to improved short-term memory abilities.49 Maternal Care , Tactile Stimulation and Visual System Development The aforementioned studies demonstrate that , far from being rigidly determined by genetic programmes , CNS development is already responsive to the environment at very early stages . The first two weeks of rodent life are characterized by the prevalent absence of a direct interaction between the pup and the external environment , with newborns spending their whole time in the nest , where the mother is the most important source of sensory experience.50 It was soon realized that differences in maternal behaviour between EE and non-EE conditions could be a fundamental factor triggering the earliest effects of EE on visual system development . This issue has been directly addressed by a detailed quantitative study of maternal behav-iour in different environmental conditions , which led to the first demonstration that EE pups receive higher levels of maternal care compared with standard-reared pups.35 More specifically , EE animals experience a continuous physical contact because of the presence of adult females in the nest and are also pro-vided with increased levels of licking and grooming Figure 2a . The amount of maternal care received by the developing pup influences hippocampal structure and function , affects mole-cular factors crucial for plasticity such as BDNF and NMDA receptors and leaves long-lasting epigenetic marks in the offspring�s physiology and behaviour.50�53 Very recently , a protocol of daily artificial tactile stimulation has been used in the rat as a strategy to promote visual system development.54 The authors reported that a combina-tion of gently stroking and massaging is highly effective in accelerating the maturation of physiological visual functions , in particular of VA Figure 2b . Interestingly , tactile stimulation increases IGF-I levels in the visual cortex at P18 , as also observed in EE animals , and blocking IGF-I action prevents the effects of massage on VA development.54 Tactile stimula-tion also compensates for inadequate maternal care the negative effects produced by repeated episodes of maternal separation or by prenatal stress on pup growth , hormone secretion , hypothalamus�pituitary�adrenal axis and BDNF expression are all rescued by artificial massage applied to pups in order to mimic maternal behaviour.55�57 Altogether , these results provide a remarkable example of cross-modal plasticity by which an increased input in a single modality reverberates as a driving force for the whole brain . Strikingly , Guzzetta et al.54 demonstrated that massage therapy also accelerates brain development in healthy preterm infants gestational age between 30 and 33 weeks . The authors found that massaged infants exhibit an earlier shortening of the interbust intervals in the EEG , a robust index of the develop-mental stage of the brain , a significantly greater reduction in the latency of flash VEPs and an increase in behavioural VA outlasting the end of treatment Figure 2c . In parallel to the results found in the animal model , massaged infants showed increased levels of plasma IGF-I , confirming that this molecule is crucially involved in mediating the effects of an enhanced sensory stimulation in the brain.54 This result is supported by the finding that , in preterm infants , tactile stimulation causes an increase in growth hormone production55 and an enhancement of serum IGF-I.58 Finally , very recent papers have shown that IGF-I and IGF-I binding protein 3 IGFBP3 could be protective against proliferative retinopathy of prematurity , a severe and relatively frequent visual disorder in preterm infants.59,60 The paper by Guzzetta et al.54 underlines the role of environmental stimulation as a crucial factor for early postnatal development in humans . Massage therapy could be a good implementation of normal intensive treatment reserved for preterm babies aimed at more efficaciously counteracting the onset of neurological pathologies associated with a precocious delivery . Rejuvenating the Adult Brain A classical dogma in neuroscience is that brain plasticity undergoes a dramatic decline with age . Significant effort is being made in multiple laboratories to develop new strategies aimed at enhancing CNS plasticity after the end of CP . In this fascinating field , the visual system emerges as the election test bed . Visual experience , indeed , can be easily controlled and the consequences of manipulations are readily measured at the anatomical , cellular and molecular level . From classic experiments in animal models to human clinical studies , it is well known that early abnormal visual experience owing to anisometropia unequal refractive power in the two eyes , strabismus abnormal alignment of one or both eyes , congenital cataract or , in animal models , MD results in a functional imbalance between the two eyes , leading to amblyopia , a widely diffused pathology 2�5 % incidence in the human population for which no suitable treatment is yet available in the adult.61 Amblyopia causes a dramatic loss of VA in an apparently healthy eye , with a great deal of evidence showing that it also results in a broad range of other perceptual abnormalities , including deficits in stereopsis and contrast sensitivity.62,63 Similarly , in animal models , the classic hallmarks of amblyopia are a permanent loss of VA in the affected eye and a pronounced OD shift of visual cortical neurons in favour of the normal eye.64�68 Traditional amblyopia therapy consists of patching or penalizing the preferred fellow eye , thus forcing the brain to use the visual input carried by the weaker amblyopic eye.69 Although it is widely accepted that the reinstatement of visual functions is possible only if corrective therapy is started early in development , recent studies in rodents have unmasked a previously unsuspected potential for promoting recovery well after the end of CP for a recent review , see Spolidoro et al.70 . EE turned out to be very effective for treating amblyopia in adulthood . A brief exposure 2�3 weeks of adult amblyopic rats to EE has been demonstrated to promote a complete recovery of both VA and OD , an effect documented not only at the electrophysiological level but also by using behavioural assessments71 Figure 3a . Recovery of plasticity in EE rats is associated with a threefold reduction in the basal levels of GABA detected in the visual cortex by in vivo brain micro-dialysis . As a consequence of decreased cortical inhibition , EE dynamically regulates cortical synaptic plasticity as well , resulting in a recovery of the possibility to evoke WM-LTP in visual cortical slices , 71 a formof LTPthat isnormallyoccluded in adulthood as a result of the maturation of inhibitory circuits.37,40 The reduction of inhibition has proved to be a crucial molecular mechanism underlying the enhancement of plasticity induced by EE Figure 3b , because restoration of plasticity is completely prevented by benzodiazepine cortical infusion during the EE period.71 The excitatory-inhibitory balance of cortical activity is well known to be crucially involved in regulating plasticity in the developing and adult brain.40,72 Consistently , chronic fluoxetine administration , another manip-ulation that reactivates cortical plasticity in adulthood promoting a full reinstatement of OD plasticity in response to MD and the recovery of visual functions from amblyopia , reduces GABAer-gic transmission , and its effects are prevented by enhancing inhibition with diazepam.73 There is also indirect evidence that the enhanced experience-dependent visual cortical plasticity driven by exposure of adult rats to complete darkness may also be related to a reduced expression of GABAA receptors relative to AMPA receptors , thus altering the balance between inhibition and excitation in the visual cortex.74,75 The promising results obtained with EE in rodents provide new hope for clinical application to human patients , given the completely non-invasive nature of this approach . Strikingly , an increasing number of clinical studies have reported that repetitive visual training based on sensory enrichment procedures may represent a very useful approach for the treatment of amblyopia , providing substantial improvement in a variety of visual tasks76�79 for a review , see Polat80 and Levi and Li81 . One caveat to the therapeutic value of these visual practice procedures , however , is the narrow specificity of achievable improvement , which is typically limited to the selected trained stimulus , condition or task.82 Only in a few tasks Vernier acuity , contrast sensitivity and detection did training lead , at least in some subjects , to a generalization of beneficial effects to other degraded visual functions , such as VA and stereoacuity.81 Interestingly , it has been suggested that the balance between excitation and inhibition is also impaired during development in amblyopic human subjects and that cortical overinhibition could underlie the degradation of spatial vision abilities.83�87 The study of experimental models of amblyopia has the advantage of enabling researchers to uncover new molecular mechanisms underlying the therapeutic value of the used procedures . The reduction of cortical inhibition in the visual cortex of EE rats is paralleled by an increased expression of BDNF71 Figure 3b , a neurotrophic factor critical for experience-dependent plasticity.40 Interestingly , it has been recently shown that intracortical administration of BDNF reactivates neural plasticity in the adult visual cortex73 and that TrkB signalling is required for the recovery of deprived-eye responses subsequent to the reinstatement of binocular vision during development.88 EE also leads to increased levels of histone acetylation in the hippocampus and neocortex.89 A similar relationship between histone acetyla-tion and EE effects could be present in the adult visual system Figure 3b , in which pharmacological treatment with inhibitors of histone deacetylases restores OD plasticity.90 Another way by which EE can regulate gene expression might be the activation of specific transcription factors . One possibility is that BDNF intracellular signalling stimulates CREB phosphor-ylation and activation , 91�93 which has a pivotal role in various forms of plasticity in the visual cortex94�96 and other brain structures.97 In line with this hypothesis , it has been shown that EE in adulthood increases immunoreactivity to CREB in the hippocampus as well98 Figure 3b . Moving from the intracellular environment to the extra-cellular milieu , one interesting observation is that EE in amblyopic rats reduces the density of chondroitin-sulphate proteoglycan CSPG perineuronal nets PNNs in the visual cortex.71 CSPGs exert a powerful repressive control on adult plasticity . This is demonstrated by pharmacological studies in which the removal of crucial components of PNNs from the mature extracellular matrix , by means of the enzyme chondroitinase ABC , reactivates OD plasticity in monocularly deprived adult rats and promotes recovery from the effects of early visual deprivation on VA and binocularity of cortical neurons.99,100 These functional effects are accompanied by a recovery of dendritic-spine density , indicating that the removal of CSPGs favours remodelling of synaptic contacts onto visual-cortex pyramidal neurons.100 Thus , working with EE offers the opportunity to affect brain dysfunctions at multiple sites of action , either by allowing the replication of the successful outcome obtained with pharmacological treatment that is difficult to apply in humans or by indicating completely new ways of intervention . The exact molecular modifications occurring upstream from the decrease in intracortical inhibition and the enhancement of BDNF expression observed in EE rats still need to be clarified . One appealing possibility is the involvement of neurotrans-mitter systems characterized by diffuse projections through-out the entire brain , which have been reported to profoundly affect plasticity in both the developing and adult brain.73,101 First studies by Rosenzweig et al.24,102 reported an increase in acetylcholinesterase activity , indicating an effect on the cholinergic system . Subsequent studies confirmed and extended this initial observation to other neurotransmitter systems , showing that EE increases noradrenaline concen-tration and strengthens the b-adrenoceptor signalling path-way in the cerebral cortex , cerebellum and brainstem , 27,103 and augments mRNA expression levels of serotonin 1A receptor and serotonin 5-HT concentration in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus.25,104,105 Interestingly , in vitro studies have repeatedly reported that 5-HT , acetylcholine , dopamine and , to a lesser extent , noradrenaline , suppress inhibition in several brain regions , including the visual cortex , possibly through a presynaptic mechanism mediated , respec-tively , by 5-HT1 , muscarinic D1 and the a-adrenergic 2 receptor families.106�113 Moreover , very recently , a modifica-tion of visual cortex pyramidal neuron responses to input signals depending on the behavioural state has been observed , related to a bidirectional modulation of somatic inhibition.114 Equally , a vast number of studies have shown that neuromodulators , and in particular 5-HT , dramatically increase the expression of BDNF mRNA in the neo-cortex.115�118 These facts , together with the recent finding that fluoxetine administration leads to a reduced GABAergic neurotransmission and an increased BDNF expression in the visual cortex of adult rats , 73 indicate that 5-HT might act as an effective trigger of EE effects on adult cortical plasticity Figure 3b . Interestingly , the neuromodulatory systems are known to regulate the arousal state of the brain101 and to modulate attentional processes.119�121 A recent study in non-amblyopic subjects provides indirect support to the important role of visual attention in driving visual cortex plasticity , showing that normal-sighted people trained with action-based video games have robust improvements in basic visual functions.122 The same effect was not observed after non-action video game playing equally engaging and visually complex , but operating at a slower pace and not requiring precise visually guided actions , suggesting that allocation of attention is a fundamental component for the effectiveness of the training paradigm.123,124 The encouraging results obtained using EE as a tool to modulate the development of the CNS and as a strategy to reopen plasticity windows in the adult have shown that it is possible to control processes crucial for brain function in a totally non-invasive manner . An important line of research deals with the potential therapeutic effects of EE in experi-mental models of nervous system injuries and disorders for a comprehensive review , see Will et al.125 and Nithia-nantharajah and Hannan126 . Given that the action of EE on brain plasticity is multi-factorial , reducing intracerebral inhibi-tion , 71 increasing histone acetylation89 and enhancing neuro-trophin expression , 26 it may be particularly efficacious in delaying the progression and or in ameliorating the symptoms of those neurological disorders in which neuronal plasticity is compromised due to alterations in some or all of these processes . Here , we focus on Rett�s syndrome , Down�s syndrome and Alzheimer�s disease . Rett�s syndrome . Rett�s syndrome ReS is a progressive disorder of CNS development that predominantly affects the female population in early childhood . After a period of apparently normal development , the onset of developmental stasis and rapid deterioration occurs at 6�18 months of age , resulting in a complex neurological and neurobehavioural phenotype with mild-to-moderate mental retardation and severe dysfunction in motor coordination skills.127 ReS has been related to loss-of-function mutations in the X-linked gene encoding the methyl-CpG-binding protein MeCP2 involved in the regulation of epigenetic mechanisms of gene expression.128 MeCP2 is a multi-functional protein having a key function in transcriptional silencing and activation129 and in the modulation of RNA splicing.130 Mice carrying conditional deletion or neuron-specific expression of mutated MeCP2 forms provide a very good model in which to examine behavioural and molecular mechanisms of ReS.131,132 These transgenic mice exhibit abnormalities in motor coordination , social interaction and cognitive abilities , with hemizygous males displaying the most severe phenotype.131�134 Electrophysiological studies from MeCP2 transgenic mice reported reduced neuronal activity in cortical135 and hippocampal136 neurons , suggesting that a shift in the balance between inhibition and excitation could be responsible for rapid motor , behavioural and cognitive regression typical of ReS.137 MeCP2-deficient mice have attenuated ability to express LTP in the hippocampus136,138 and in the motor and somatosensory cortex.138 Importantly , the gene encoding BDNF is under MeCP2 regulation , 139 and the progression of symptoms in MeCP2-deficient mice seems to be correlated with gradually decrea-sing levels of circulating BDNF.140 Given that BDNF expression depends on neuronal activity , the reduced neuronal excitability caused by MeCP2 insufficiency could lead to a decreased BDNF protein level.140 BDNF overexpression in MeCP2 mutant mice is able to compensates the deficits at both the behavioural and electrophysiological level.140 This implies that neurons deficient in functional MeCP2 retain the capacity to recover when appropriate neurotrophic signalling is re-established . Similarly , motor coordination and cognitive deficits in MeCP2 mutant mice are also reversed by EE.141,142 The fundamental mechanisms through which EE exerts its beneficial effects , that is , increased trophic factor expression , decreased inhibition and increased activity-dependent hystone acetylation , 143 are all involved in the pathogenesis of ReS , thus indicating a strong rationale for the use of EE to treat ReS cognitive deficit . Accordingly , BDNF is increased in the cerebellum of MeCP2 mutant mice exposed to EE141 and systemic infusion of IGF-I partially reverts their ReS-like symptoms.144 Down�s syndrome . Down�s syndrome DS is caused by triplication of chromosome 21 Chr21 and is the most diffused genetic cause of mental retardation . People with DS have marked cognitive deficits , with reduced IQ and learning and memory performances.145 During recent years , several murine models of DS have been generated , carrying triplications of different segments of Chr16 , which has a high degree of synteny with human Chr21.146,147 The most intensively studied mouse model of DS is the Ts65Dn line , 148 which summarizes the main hallmarks of the DS phenotype , including characteristic craniofacial abnormalities , impaired spatial and non-spatial learning abilities and attention deficits.149�154 At the cellular level , Ts65Dn mice have a reduced number of hippocampal and cerebellar neurons , 155,156 impaired neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus in both young and aged adults157,158 and a prominent reduction in dendritic branching in several brain regions , accompanied by alterations in spine size and shape.159 It is noteworthy that DS is also associated with reduced hippocampal neurogenesis160 and volume161 in humans . Adult Ts65Dn mice show age-dependent degeneration of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons BFCNs , 162 the most characteristic neuropathological correlate of the late cognitive decline observed in Alzheimer�s disease AD . Virtually all persons born with DS develop AD if they live into their fourth decade of life.163,164 There is evidence that degeneration of BFCNs in Ts65Dn mice is related to a marked decrease in the NGF retrograde transport from the hippocampus to the basal forebrain.165,166 Intracerebroventricular NGF infusion reverses BFCN morphological abnormalities , restoring the deficit in cholinergic innervation.165 BDNF signalling in Ts65Dn mice is also disrupted . In the frontal cortex , lower levels of BDNF with respect to diploid animals are found and negatively correlated with the progressive deterioration of working memory performance.167 A major functional synaptic defect detectable in Ts65Dn mice is the failure to induce LTP in the hippocampus.168�171 This deficit has been attributed to excessive inhibition , 171 a hypothesis recently confirmed by Fernandez et al. , 172 which showed that the spatial learning disabilities observed in Ts65Dn mice are rescued by administration of non-competi-tive antagonists of GABAA receptors . The impairment in synaptic plasticity is linked to marked morphological changes in the structure of synapses , with a selective enlargement of the active zones of asymmetric synapses and increased immunostaining for synaptic proteins marking inhibitory synapses.173 Given that EE is particularly effective in reducing GABAergic inhibition and in enhancing neurotrophin expression , it has great potential for therapeutic application in the treatment of DS . Martinez-Cue � et al.174,175 reported increased exploratory behaviour and enhanced spatial learning in EE Ts65Dn mice , although the effect was gender specific . At the cellular level , Ts65Dn mice raised in EE conditions have shown increased dendritic branching in the frontal cortex.176 Despite these results , a thorough analysis of the EE effects on mouse models of DS is still needed . Alzheimer�s disease . Alzheimer�s disease is a neuro-degenerative pathology leading to progressive memory loss and severe cognitive decline . The disease is characterized by two pathological hallmarks , mainly affecting the neocortex and hippocampus , that is , senile plaques extracellular aggregates of b-amyloid derived from proteolysis of the precursor protein APP operated by the BACE enzyme and neurofibrillary tangles intraneuronal aggregations of hyperphosphorylated forms of the microtubule-associated protein tau .177,178 In addition , as mentioned before , AD is invariantly associated with marked degeneration of BFCNs.179 Most AD cases are sporadic and seem to result from an interaction of multiple genetic and still unknown environmental factors . However , there are also familial forms of AD that are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner . Three genes have been involved in familial AD APP , presenilin 1 PS1 and presenilin 2 PS2 . The main mutations at the levels of these genes have all been targeted in transgenic mouse modelling studies . A genetic risk factor for the sporadic form of AD has also been found in the e4 polymorphism of the apolipoprotein E APOE gene.180 Levi et al.181 were the first to examine the effect of differential rearing in a mouse model of AD , using transgenic mice expressing the human APOE3 or APOE4 alleles . Enriched mice transgenic for human APOE3 showed im-proved learning and memory associated with higher hippo-campal levels of presynaptic protein synaptophysin and of NGF , whereas mice transgenic for human APOE4 were unaffected by EE . EE has repeatedly been reported to enhance performance in various cognitive tasks in trans-genic mice carrying a double mutation at the level of both APP and PS1 genes , 182,183 in mice carrying the so-called Swedish mutation SweAPP , 184�186 and in AD11 transgenic mice expressing a recombinant anti-NGF factor antibody.187 The effect of EE on Ab levels and plaque deposition , as well as their impact on cognitive improvement , is controversial . Jankowsky et al.182,188 unexpectedly reported that EE APP PS1 transgenic mice develop a higher amyloid burden with increases in aggregated and total Ab levels , particularly in the hippocampus . Arendash et al.184 failed to observe any change in Ab deposition in EE APP transgenic mice . In contrast , Lazarov et al.189 reported a decrease in hippocampal and cortical Ab levels and amyloid deposits in EE APP PS1 transgenic animals compared with standard-housed controls . In addition , the enzymatic activity of neprilysin , an Ab-degrading endopeptidase , was found to be elevated in the brain of EE mice.189 A reduction in brain b-amyloid deposition after EE exposure has also been shown in APP , TgCRND8 and AD11 transgenic mice.186,187,190,191 Some studies have also investigated the effects of EE on neurogen-esis in AD mouse models . Although conditional PS1 knockout mice and mice overexpressing either wild-type human PS1 or the mutant form P117L show a deficiency in EE-induced neurogenesis , 192�194 it has been recently reported that EE promotes hippocampal neurogenesis in APP and TgCRND8 mice.185,191,195 Moreover , EE increases angiogenesis and facilitates blood Ab clearance through a differential regulation of Ab receptor transporter molecules in TgCRND8 mice.196 Lazarov et al.189 carried out a microarray analysis to identify gene expression changes in APP PS1 transgenic mice placed in EE conditions . This study revealed a total of 41 genes differentially regulated in response to EE , with the vast majority of genes that showed elevated expression encoding polypeptides involved in learning and memory , synaptic plasticity , neurogenesis , vasculogenesis , neuronal cell growth and cell survival pathways e.g. , NGF-1A , BDNF CaMKIIa .189 It is particularly interesting that transthyretin , a protein involved in Ab clearance , is upregulated in transgenic mice raised with EE.183 A quantitative RT-PCR study further confirmed that EE promotes the upregulation of trophic factor expression NT-3 , BDNF , IGF-I and VEGF in the hippocam-pus of SweAPP mice.185 Finally , environmental stimulation attenuates pro-oxidative processes and triggers anti-oxidative defence mechanisms , as indicated by diminished biomarkers for reactive oxygen and nitrogen species , downregulation of proinflammatory and pro-oxidative mediators and upregula-tion of superoxide dismutase 1 SOD1 and SOD2.197 Although the mechanisms underlying the beneficial effects of EE on mouse models of AD remain to be clarified in more detail , these studies indicate that an enhanced environmental stimulation may help in slowing down or preventing the cognitive decline associated with AD . Altogether , the findings reviewed here show how dramatic the influence exerted by the environment can be on brain plasticity . Studies using the EE paradigm have indicated a number of molecular hotspots that might emerge as possible ways of accession for a successful treatment of neuropatho-logical conditions affecting the juvenile and adult CNS . An open issue is the extent to which EE in animal models is relevant for the human living experience . EE is a complex paradigm , as an increased stimulation is provided at multiple sensory , motor , cognitive and social levels . Although most humans do experience a high degree of environmental complexity and novelty , levels of cognitive , social and physical stimulation vary greatly among individuals and in different periods of life . Strong correlative and epidemiological evidence shows that lifestyle , including occupation , leisure activities and physical exercise , has a direct effect on the risk of cognitive decline . Results indicate that a higher level and variety of mental and physical activity is associated with a lower cognitive decline and a reduced risk for dementia198�204 . These results encourage stronger efforts in the application of EE paradigms , alone or in combination with pharmacological treatments , for the therapy of neurological disorders .

We propose a model in which environmental stimulation could promote the strengthening of neuromodulatory transmission that triggers the decrease in GABA-mediated intracortical inhibition and , in parallel or in series , the enhancement of BDNF expression .

20019748	Apoptosis results when a specialised signalling pathway is activated , and this signal pathway intersects with many pathways of immune activation or cell differentiation . TLRs are important sensors of especially microbial molecules and can recognise diverse components from infectious agents such as double-stranded RNA TLR3 , bacterial LPS TLR4 , lipopeptides TLR2 , microbial DNA TLR9 and viral RNA TLR7 8 .1 Although TLRs are best known for their ability to initiate innate immune response and drive the stimulation of the adaptive immune response , their principal capacity to signal apoptosis has also been described . Some of the 10 known TLRs such as TLR2 or 7 use the cytosolic protein MyD88 exclusively as a signal-transducing adapter . TLR3 instead uses the protein TRIF , while TLR4 can signal through both MyD88 and TRIF . Although initial description of apoptosis through TLR demonstrated this activity for TLR2,2,3 later studies suggest that only TRIF but not MyD88 can signal apoptosis.4 In macrophages , these TRIF-using receptors can induce apoptosis only if NF-kB is inhibited at the same time.4 With their capacity to induce apoptosis and activate the immune system , TLR agonists are an attractive therapeutic option for treatment of infectious and malignant disease.5 Apoptosis usually involves the activation of caspases through one of two upstream pathways.6 One the extrinsic pathway is triggered at the cell surface by death receptors and uses the protease caspase-8 to activate the effector caspase-3 or to activate Bax Bak via caspase-8-dependent cleavage of the BH3-only protein Bid . The other pathway , known as the intrinsic , mitochondrial or Bcl-2-regulated pathway , involves the release of mitochondrial cytochrome c into the cytosol , which causes the activation of caspases through a large protein complex . In the mitochondrial path-way , the proteins of the Bcl-2 family are critical regulators . The BH3-only-subfamily proteins for instance Bim , Puma , Noxa act as triggers that activate the effectors of cytochrome c release , Bax and Bak . This activation can be blocked by inhibitors of the Bcl-2 family such as Bcl-2 , Bcl-xL and Mcl-1.7,8 Disseminated melanoma is highly resistant to chemother-apy . To test the possibility of new molecular approaches to apoptosis induction in melanoma , we explored the capacity of TLR3 to activate the components of the apoptotic machinery . It has recently been demonstrated that the synthetic ligand of TLR3 , poly I C , causes upregulation of Noxa and apoptosis in a number of human tumour cell lines.9 TLR3 is expressed in many human tumour cells10�12 and although a proapoptotic effect of poly I C in cancer cells has been shown , this requires additional stimuli , such as IFN treatment or inhibition of protein synthesis , in most tumour cells.10,12 We found very little apoptosis induction by poly I C alone in a panel of human melanoma cell lines although poly I C could induce apoptosis in the presence of the inhibitor of protein synthesis , CHX . However , HaCaT human keratinocytes were highly sensitive to apoptosis induction by poly I C. To delineate the apoptotic signalling pathway without the confounding effects of CHX , we first analysed HaCaT cells . The BH3-only protein Noxa was strongly upregulated by poly I C in HaCaT cells . However , Noxa was dispensable for apoptosis induction by poly I C , which used components of the death receptor signalling pathway to activate caspases . In melanoma cells , this pathway was triggered by poly I C in the presence of CHX or when the cellular IAPs were pharmacologically inhibited . TLR3 thus can trigger a proapoptotic pathway in melanoma cells whose potency can be strongly enhanced by novel inhibitors of IAPs . Results We first tested a panel of four human melanoma-derived cell lines for apoptosis induction by poly I C. Very little apoptosis was observed with concentrations up to 50 mg ml . However , HaCaT human keratinocytes were sensitive to treatment with poly I C at various doses Figure 1a and Supplementary Figure S1A . Although all melanoma lines expressed TLR3 mRNA at clearly detectable levels Supplementary Figure S1C , they only became sensitive for poly I C-induced apoptosis when protein synthesis was simultaneously blocked by the addition of CHX , suggesting that an unstable inhibitor of poly I C-induced apoptosis was expressed in melanoma cells that had to be degraded before apoptosis was induced Figure 1b and Supplementary Figure S1B . Cell death could be blocked by the broad caspase inhibitor zVAD-fmk Figure 1b and Supplementary Figure S1A . As CHX might confound pathway analysis , we decided to focus first on the pathway to apoptosis in HaCaT cells . Both mitochondrial pathway in this case mediated by the BH3-only protein Noxa and a pathway involving caspase-8 have been implicated in poly I C-induced apoptosis . Noxa protein was strongly induced in HaCaT cells upon treatment with poly I C , while levels of the BH3-only proteins Bim and Puma were not substantially altered Bim expression even seemed to be slightly reduced Figure 1c . Induction of Noxa was blocked by the inhibitor of protein synthesis CHX Supplementary Figure S1D . Induction of type-I IFN IFN-I is a well-known function of TLR3 , and noxa has been described as an IFN-I-response gene.9 RNAi against the IFN-I receptor blocked the induction of Noxa by poly I C Supplementary Figure S1E . Noxa was found almost exclusively in the mitochondrial fraction of poly I C-stimulated HaCaT cells Supplementary Figure S1F . These data suggested that poly I C triggered the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway through IFN-I-mediated upregulation of Noxa , and we turned to a more detailed analysis of this pathway . Poly I C activated Bax , as measured by staining for active Bax using an antibody that only binds to Bax if it has undergone a conformational change seen during activation Figure 2a . However , this activation was almost completely blocked by a caspase inhibitor Figure 2a . This indicated that the mitochondrial pathway was activated but subsequently to caspase activation . It is known that Bax can be activated by caspase-8-dependent cleavage of Bid to its active form tBid. Indeed , poly I C induced the proteolytic processing of caspase-8 over time as well as cleavage of the caspase-8 substrate Bid Figure 2b and c . Together , these data showed that poly I C treatment of HaCaT cells activated two probably separate apoptotic pathways , namely a mitochondrial pathway involving upregu-lation of Noxa and a pathway involving caspase-8 . Caspase-8 can induce apoptosis via Bid cleavage and mitochondrial activation , but may also circumvent mitochondria by direct activation of caspase-3 , depending on the cell type.13 We next used RNAi against a number of candidate signalling proteins to define the pathway . HaCaT cell lines stably expressing shRNA directed against Noxa or Bim were treated with poly I C . However , downregulation of either of these proteins Figure 3a failed to protect the cells . Since blockade of Noxa expression upon poly I C treatment by the shRNA was not complete Supplementary Figure S2A , we also used transient transfection of Noxa-specific siRNA . This strategy on its own surprisingly induced some cell death . Knockdown of Noxa was very efficient Supplementary Figure S2B yet failed to protect against cell death induced by poly I C Figure 3b . Likewise , transient knockdown of Bid or Puma by siRNA had no effect Figure 3b for knockdown efficiency see Supplementary Figure S2B , C . Note that apoptosis induction was not impaired by IFNAR1 knockdown , although poly I C-dependent upregulation of Noxa was prevented Supplementary Figure S1E , and data not shown . We further used HaCaT cells overexpressing Bcl-2 to test for the importance of the mitochondrial pathway . As shown in Supplementary Figure S3 , transgenic Bcl-2 failed to protect against poly I C-induced apoptosis while protecting , as expected , against apoptosis induced by UV light . Taken together , these data strongly suggest that although some components of the mitochondrial pathway are activated by poly I C in HaCaT cells , this pathway is dispensable for this form of apoptosis . We next tested the hypothesis that poly I C activated caspase-8 through TLR3 . TLR3 is an endosomal receptor that signals when its ligand is taken up in endosomes into the cell.14 Maturation of endosomes can be blocked by the inhibitor of endosomal ATPase , bafilomycin-A . Accordingly , Melanoma Melanoma HaCaT poly I C-induced apoptosis in HaCaT was inhibited by bafilomycin-A Supplementary Figure S1B . Knockdown of either TLR3 or its signalling adapter , TRIF , significantly reduced cell death induction by poly I C in HaCaT cells Figure 3b . In good accordance with the results of the cell death assays Figure 3b , knockdown of TLR3 and TRIF reduced the activation of caspase-8 and caspase-3 while Puma-specific siRNA did not Figure 3c . There was no change in caspase-8 processing , but a slight reduction in caspase-3 cleavage when Bid was knocked down , although no reduction in cell death was seen . Most likely , there is some additional caspase-3 activation via Bid and the mitochondrial pathway , but this is not relevant as sufficient caspase-3 is activated also without mitochondrial contribution . 800 600 SSC-H 400 200 1000 1.83 � 0.6 1000 1.83 � 0.6 800 600 SSC-H 400 200 Importantly , knockdown of caspase-8 by siRNA also clearly reduced cell death and activation of caspase-8 3 induced by poly I C Figure 3b and c for knockdown efficiency see Supplementary Figure S2B , C . Poly I C treatment of HaCaT cells thus activates proapoptotic pathways that encompass Noxa induction , caspase-dependent cleavage of Bid and activation of Bax . However , the signalling pathway that is relevant to induction of cell death involves endosomal uptake of poly I C , signalling through TLR3 and TRIF , and activation of caspase-8 . As shown above , poly I C induced apoptosis in melanoma cells in the presence of CHX . Poly I C CHX-induced apoptosis in melanoma cells was inhibited by bafilomycin-A , indicating poly I C signalling through TLR3 Supplementary Figure S1B . Treatment with poly I C but not CHX upregulated the expression of TLR3 in several melanoma cell lines Supple-mentary Figure S1C . We proceeded to test whether caspase-8 was also activated and was also required for proapoptotic signalling by poly I C in melanoma cells in the presence of CHX . As shown in Supplementary Figure S4A , caspase-8 activation could be observed shortly after treatment with poly I C CHX in the tested melanoma cell lines strongest in Sbcl2 , whereas levels of cFLIPL did not change considerably . As shown in Figure 4a , caspase-8-specific RNAi clearly reduced cell death induced by poly I C CHX in three melanoma lines . In one cell line , caspase-8-specific siRNA had no effect despite fairly efficient knockdown of the protein Figure 4b this lack of protection is consistent with only very moderate processing of caspase-8 in this cell line 1205Lu Supplementary Figure S4A . Nevertheless , poly I C CHX-induced cell death was blocked by adding zVAD-fmk in all melanoma cell lines data not shown . TLR3 TRIF therefore seemed to engage a proapoptotic pathway that was in melanoma cells controlled by some CHX-sensitive protein . Recent evidence indicates that cellular IAPs cIAP1 and cIAP2 are involved in the regulation of caspase-8 activation , at least downstream from tumour necrosis factor receptor-1 TNFR1 .15,16 Both cIAP1 and cIAP2 , and the related protein XIAP were expressed in the melanoma lines . Treatment with CHX induced some reduction in cIAP1 protein strongest in 451Lu and noticeable in most experiments on WM35 , although only very moderately in 1205Lu , whereas protein levels of XIAP and cFLIPL remained constant Figure 4c and Supplementary Figure S4A . This suggested that cIAP-regulated activation of caspase-8 at least contributed to apoptosis induced by poly I C CHX in siTRIFsiTLR3 siCasp8 siCtrl siPumasiBid -+ -+ -+ -+ -+ -+ melanoma lines although there appear to be other pathways that may be activated by this treatment in some cells , as suggested by the results obtained with the 1205Lu line . The recent development of IAP antagonists Smac mimetics makes it possible to investigate this checkpoint . These inhibitors cause depletion of cIAPs by the ubiquitin�protea-some system and induce the secretion of TNF in certain cell types . Upon cIAP degradation , autocrine TNF secretion has been reported to efficiently induce apoptosis through its receptor TNFR1 in those cells.15,16 Further , there is evidence suggesting that TLR3 TRIF might use the signal transduction machinery of TNFR1 . In particular , TNF-signalling molecules RIP and TRADD have been demonstrated to be also part of the TLR3-signalling machinery.17,18 Since our data show that poly I C can , like TNFR1 , activate caspase-8 , we followed the hypothesis that cIAPs may control TRIF-induced apoptosis in a manner similar to TNFR1-induced cell death . We used the Smac mimetic LBW242 to test for a role of cIAPs in poly I C-induced apoptosis . Melanoma lines and HaCaT cells expressed varying levels of cIAP1 , cIAP2 and XIAP Figure 5a . Treatment with LBW242 caused reduction in cIAP1 levels , while XIAP levels stayed constant and cIAP2 levels surprisingly increased after 24 h LBW242 treatment Figure 5a and b . Treatment of cell lines with a combination of poly I C and LBW242 showed a strong synergistic , proapoptotic effect of the two compounds Figure 5c . In all SiCasp8SiCtrl SiCasp8 SiCtrl C 100 80 % PI 20 In susceptible tumour cells LBW242 alone induces apoptosis through NF-kB activation and subsequent auto-crine TNF-induced cell death.15 We detected the activation of 35 an NF-kB-driven luciferase reporter gene in 1205Lu cells by single treatment with poly I C or LBW Supplementary Figure S7A . Using IL-8 mRNA transcription as a readout for NF-kB % 60 cells 50 positive 40 PI 30 20 * 10 % 30 cells 25 positive 20 PI activation , we could detect IL-8 induction only using poly I C but not LBW Supplementary Figure S7B . As TLR3 TRIF normally , probably , causes the activation of canonical NF-kB1 signalling through TRAF6,20 while Smac mimetics activate non-canonical NF-kB2 signalling through NIK , 15 this might reflect a differential activation of the IL-8 promoter . Impor-tantly , no TNF was detectable in the supernatants of the four melanoma lines incubated in the presence of LBW242 10 mM or poly I C 50 mg ml , alone or incubated with LBW242 plus poly I C detection limit was about 15 pg ml , data not shown . This strongly suggests that indeed cIAPs operate to control the assembly of a death-inducing complex around the adapter molecule TRIF . Loss of cIAPs , which can be achieved by pharmacological Smac mimetics , sensitises the cells for poly I C-induced apoptosis . This pathway uncovers an unexpected apoptosis susceptibility in otherwise extremely resistant melanoma cells , and holds promise for therapeutic targeting of disseminated melanoma . This study investigated signal transduction components in poly I C-induced apoptosis . In HaCaT cells , poly I C-induced apoptosis required endosomal uptake and engagement of TLR3 , TRIF and caspase-8 . Although elements of the mitochondrial pathway were activated , they were not essential for apoptosis . In human melanoma cells , efficient induction of apoptosis by poly I C occurred only together with blockade of protein synthesis and then likewise proceeded through caspase-8 . Melanoma cells were sensitised to apoptosis induction through poly I C by the Smac mimetic LBW242 . TLRs are receptors for microbial ligands and serve to alert the cell and the immune system to the presence of infectious agents . They are most widely expressed on myeloid cells , but are also found on other cell types such as endothelium in a number of tissues.21 The expression pattern of the various TLRs varies considerably . TLR3 is found on a number of non-immune cells where it may have functions in recognition of viruses that infect these cells directly . Apoptosis is an important defence mechanism against viral infection , 22 and it is possible that widespread expression of TLR3 reflects this use of the receptor . Apoptosis induction by poly I C in tumour cells has been reported previously and has been found to depend on Noxa-dependent mitochondrial apoptosis.9 Although Noxa may contribute to this response in some cases , it was not required in HaCaT cells . TLRs can signal via one of two intracellular adapter molecules , MyD88 or TRIF . Available evidence suggests that TRIF but not MyD88 , when engaged by TLRs , can induce apoptosis , 4,9,23,24 and both TLR3 and TRIF were required for apoptosis induction in our study , as was caspase-8 . During Fas death-receptor-induced apoptosis , caspase-8 is recruited into a complex termed DISC , whose main compo-nents are FADD , cFLIP and caspase-8 25 in the case of TNF-induced apoptosis , this also includes the adapter protein TRADD.26 TRIF can trigger a number of signalling responses , notably induction of type-I IFN . A number of studies suggest that TRIF can in fact recruit or at least activate components of the death-receptor-family member TNFR1 signal transduction machinery , involving DISC components . This has been shown for the kinase RIP117,27 and most recently for the protein TNF plays a number of roles in cellular signalling , such as induction of NF-kB activity in immune cell activation and differentiation.28 Through the same receptor TNFR1 , TNF can also induce apoptosis . Recent work shows that the function of the proapoptotic activity of TNFR1 DISC is regulated by cIAPs . Depletion of cIAPs by Smac mimetics sensitised cells to apoptosis induction through autocrine TNF.15,16,29 Further , it has been shown that overexpression of cIAP2 increases the resistance of nasopharyngeal carcinoma to poly I C-induced apoptosis.30 Our results , therefore , strongly suggest that TRIF , when engaged by TLR3 , can recruit a similar DISC whose activity is also under the control of cIAPs . It is likely that cIAPs in this context are negative regulators of the recruitment of DISC components , especially caspase-8 . In most situations , the function of TRIF is probably induction of type-I IFN rather than induction of apoptosis , especially in myeloid cells . It is unclear how the switch between these two functions is regulated . In macrophages , inhibition of the proteasome permits this switch , presumably because protea-some inhibition blocks the activation of NF-kB.4 cIAP2 is an NF-kB target31 and its upregulation may be relevant in this context . It is not clear why poly I C induced apoptosis in HaCaT cells despite the presence of high levels of cIAPs . One possibility is that HaCaT cells express different levels of downstream signalling molecules or that poly I C causes a more efficient formation of the TRIF-signalling complex in these cells . Detailed analysis of assembly and signalling will be necessary to understand the requirements of this proapoptotic signalling pathway . TLR3 has been found expressed in many tumour cell lines11,12 and was even shown to be overexpressed in renal cell carcinoma as compared with non-malignant kidney.32 Stimulation through TLR3 may therefore be one option to be considered for therapeutic induction of apoptosis in tumours , and the mechanism of apoptosis induction and inhibition therefore needs to be studied carefully . Materials and Methods Cell lines and culture conditions . HaCaT keratinocytes33 were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10 % FCS PAA and 1 % v v penicillin streptomycin Biochrom , Berlin , Germany . 1205Lu , 451Lu , WM35 and Sbcl2 human melanoma cells representing different stages of tumour progression 1205Lu and 451Lu from metastatic melanoma , and WM35 and Sbcl2 radial-growth-phase melanomas 34,35 were obtained from Dr Meenhard Herlyn , Wistar Institute , Philadelphia , and cultured in TU2 % melanoma medium containing 80 % v v MCDB153 , 20 % v v Leibovitz�s L-15 , 2 % v v FCS Biochrom , 5 mg ml insulin bovine , 1.68 mM CaCl2 and penicillin streptomycin Biochrom .

20019749	Radiation exposure during radiotherapy is a mainstay of abdominopelvic malignancy treatments . The efficacy of abdominal or pelvic radiotherapy requires an optimal com-promise between normal tissue damage and tumor control , that is the risk benefit ratio.1 Intra-abdominal organs located close to cancers can be affected during radiotherapy . The most radiosensitive organ of the intra-abdominal area is the small intestine.2 Small intestinal mucosa is composed of a simple columnar epithelium that is folded to form crypts of Lieberkuhn � residence site of intestinal stem cells as well as villi composed of differentiated epithelial cells . Epithelium has a very fast renewal potential arising from the high level of stem cell proliferation ability . Differentiation of proliferating stem cells around the villus is accompanied by the develop-ment of specific functions by epithelial cells , such as nutrient absorption , water and electrolyte transport , mucus secretion , neuropeptide production and immune defense . The preserva-tion of stem cell integrity takes on a crucial importance for the renewal of small intestine epithelium and hence its function-ality . Exposure of small intestinal tissue to ionizing radiation may lead to the loss of its integrity by a dose-dependent stem cell depletion initiating gastrointestinal disorders.3 Radio-therapy is associated with a high incidence of undesirable acute and or chronic gastrointestinal complications that can affect the patient�s quality of life and or may be life threaten-ing.4 The severity of acute radiation enteritis may be predictive of more severe chronic gastrointestinal symptoms.4 Acute or chronic side effects can also be aggravated after a radio-therapy accident such as an overdose.5 Treatments usually applied to manage acute enteritis are only symptomatic . The lack of curative treatment at present and the potential severity of the disorder highlight the importance of novel and effective therapeutic strategies for gastrointestinal complications after radiation exposure . Stem cell-based approaches using mesenchymal stem cells MSC are promising for the development of future therapy . MSC are currently among the most advanced cell therapy tools , with the availability of three FDA-approved products , Prochymal , Provacel and Chondrogen . MSC treat-ment has already been used in clinical protocols as an adjunct to bone marrow BM transplantation . Clinical studies have reported a possible beneficial therapeutic effect of MSC in supporting the engraftment of hematopoietic stem cells in hematological malignancies , 6 for the improvement of bone growth by bone matrix synthesis in osteogenesis imperfecta , 7 and for the reduction of gastrointestinal disorders in patients with severe resistant graft-versus-host disease GVHD .8 Other clinical studies have reported effects of MSC on gastrointestinal healing such as the reversion of colon peritonitis in patients with GVHD9 or the treatment of rectovaginal and perianal fistulas in patients with Crohn�s disease.10 In the work reported here , the capability of MSC to induce a therapeutic benefit was analyzed in an experimental model using NOD SCID mice with radiation-induced small Results Multipotential property of human BM-derived MSC . We verified the stem character of human BM-derived MSCs hMSC in vitro by their ability to carry out multiple differentiations . We used specific induction media to induce osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation of BM-derived cells . As shown in Figure 1A , we found evidence for both osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation potential of the purified hMSC used in this study . Osteogenic differentiation is associated with extracellular precipitate stained with alizarin and corresponding to calcium deposits Figure 1Ab . Adipogenic differentiation is accompanied by the accumulation of lipid droplets stained by Oil-Red Figure 1Ac . Human MSC infusion restores small intestinal integrity . In this part of the study , mice were exposed to a sub-lethal dose of abdominal irradiation 8.5 Gy . Twenty-four hours after irradiation , mice received in the lateral tail vein a total of 5 106 hMSC . In this experimental model , the therapeutic benefit of hMSC treatment on radiation-induced small intestinal integrity structure and function alterations was tested . We also analyzed cellular mechanisms of hMSC action . Level of hMSC engraftment . Quantitative PCR analyses indicate a very low frequency of human cell engraftment in the small intestinal epithelium of mice 0.13�0.06 % corresponding to 0.13�0.06 human MSC engrafted per 1000 mice intestinal cells 3 days after irradiation . This intestinal damage . In this experimental model , we analyzed in vivo the potential of MSC treatment on cellular mechanisms of cell function restoration . engraftment was observed in only 4 of 10 tested animals A Semont , � unpublished observation . Histological studies of the four positive mice showed that individual human cells homed in to sites in the lamina propria around small intestinal epithelium crypts Figure 1Bd . Clustered cells were also observed in the mesentery in all 10 tested animals Figure 1Be . Functional studies . To obtain evidence for functional integrity of the small intestinal epithelium , we tested two parameters the secretory response and the absorptive response of epithelial cells . The secretory response was studied by stimulated in vitro electrolyte transport measurement and the absorptive response by membrane Na ? K ? -ATPase activity evaluation . Electrolyte transport analysis . Small intestines were mounted in diffusion chambers and voltage clamped after challenge with electrical field stimulation EFS Figure 2a . Exposure of intestinal segments to EFS leads to a transient increase of the short-circuit current Isc , corresponding to an enhancement of the serosal to mucosal chloride flux . In the control group , the maximum Isc response recorded after EFS exposure was 66.7�5.7 mA cm2 . Three days after irradiation irradiated animals IA group , the maximal Isc response was significantly reduced , falling to 25.8�5.8 mA cm2 . Three days after radiation exposure , the observed response to EFS was close to the baseline 43.9�5.3 mA cm2 in the MSC-treated group IA ? MSC group . We tested the specificity of hMSC effects by administering equal numbers of human skin fibroblasts . The injection of fibroblasts showed any adverse radiation effects on the hyporesponsiveness to EFS IA ? F group . Na ? K ? -ATPase activity analysis . Activation of the membrane Na ? K ? -ATPase pump is associated with an increase of nutrient absorption across the small intestinal epithelium Figure 2b . In the control group , the measured 60 2 cm A 40 ISC 20 mg *� 0.2 per Na+ 0 basal level of Na ? K ? -ATPase activity was 0.58�0.09 U mg proteins . Three days after irradiation , Na ? K ? -ATPase activity was reduced to 52.6 % of basal level . The Na ? K ? -ATPase activity measured in the irradiated and MSC-treated group was 0.66�0.13 U mg protein . Radiation-induced reduction of Na ? K ? -ATPase activity is thus reversed by MSC treatment , but not by fibroblasts infusion . These results show for the first time an ability of hMSC to restore small intestinal function in a context of radiation-induced disorders . Structural studies . We used morphometric analysis to evaluate the thickness of the small intestinal epithelium , which is a criterion for structural integrity . The estimated jejunum epithelium thickness in the control group was 320.6�11.8 mm , obtained by adding the values of villus height 244.0�9.0 mm , functional cell compartment to Lieberkuhn � crypt depth 76.6�5.0 mm , stem cell compartment Figure 3Aa and B . Twenty-four hours after irradiation , at the time of hMSC injection , no modification of the structural integrity of the small intestine was observed data not shown . At 3 days , irradiation induced partial epithelial atrophy , corresponding to a reduction of 27 % of villus height Figure 3Ab and B . Irradiation-induced epithelial atrophy was not anymore observed at 15 days data not shown . After MSC infusion into irradiated mice , the structural integrity of the small intestine was already restored at 3 days Figure 3Ac . The epithelium thickness measurement showed hypertrophy increase of 69 % versus control resulting from increases in both crypt depth 167 % and villus height 38 % , Figure 3B . The infusion of fibroblasts into irradiated mice did not restore structural integrity 3 days after irradiation . On the contrary , after fibroblast injection we observed ulcerated areas concomitant with inflammatory infiltration Figure 3Ad . Owing to fibroblasts-induced pernicious effects on the epithelial structure , no quantitative measurement could be performed . These results showed that specifically hMSC treatment increases and accelerates the structural re-epithelization of the small intestine exposed to radiation . The level of the epithelium hypertrophy observed into irradiated mice receiving hMSC treatment Figure 3Ba progressively decreased over time . At 120 days , epithelium thickness returned to the baseline level Figure 4 . Cellular mechanisms of hMSC action . To study cellular mechanisms of hMSC action , the quantification and localization of epithelial apoptosis and proliferating cells were investigated . Cell positions were determined according to the methods established by Potten.3 Intermingled cells of Paneth cells , recently described by Clevers as intestinal stem cells , were also scored.11 Characterization of intestinal stem cells was completed by an immunohistochemistrical analysis using Musashi-1 staining . Apoptosis analysis . Apoptotic cells were studied on histological slides of small intestine by TUNEL assay Figure 5A . We first analyzed the percentage of TUNEL-positive crypt�villus axis of a small intestine segment Figure 5Ba . Second , for each TUNEL-positive crypt�villus axis , we determined the number of apoptotic cells in crypt compartments Figure 5Bb and the percentage of apoptotic cells in each cell category of the crypt�villus axis Figure 5Bc . Twenty-four hours after irradiation time of hMSC infusion we observed a five-fold increase in apoptotic epithelial cells in the small intestine . At this time , apoptotic cells were preferentially observed in positions 4�6 of crypts and between Paneth cells suggesting a stem and or progenitor cell apoptosis data not shown . Three days after irradiation , we still observed an induction of apoptosis Figure 5Ab , detecting TUNEL-positive cells in 87.7�2.4 % of the crypt� villus axis , compared with 22.2�1.1 % in the control group Figure 5Ba . Hence , we observed a dramatic 8.6-fold increase in apoptotic cells in crypt cell compartments exposed to radiation . Apoptotic cells were seen to be preferentially 57.4�2.1 % located in positions 4�6 of crypts , likely corresponding to stem progenitor cell apoptosis Figure 5Bb and Bc . We also showed , after irradiation , an absence of apoptotic cells at the villi tip Figure 5Bc , probably corre-sponding to the early stages of a reduction in the detachment-induced apoptosis of enterocytes anoikis . These results seem to show that the self-renewal capability of the small intestine is significantly reduced after irradiation . hMSC infusion into irradiated mice 3 days decreased reduction of 51.3 % versus irradiated animals the percentage of crypt� villus axis containing apoptotic cells Figure 5Ac and Ba . Furthermore , in irradiated mice treated with hMSC , the m 600 number of apoptotic cells in the crypt compartment returned to values close to the baseline Figure 5Bb , corresponding to a specific decrease in the apoptosis of small intestinal stem progenitor cells Figure 5Bc . The percentage of apoptotic cells at the tip of villi observed after irradiation increased to 16.3�0.2 % after hMSC treatment , without reaching control values Figure 5Bc . Fifteen days after irradiation and hMSC infusion , the number of apoptotic cells in crypt compartments fell back to control values data not shown . We have hypothesized that the re-establishment of the self-renewal ability of small intestine after irradiation requires a decrease in apoptosis . We show that the hMSC treatment is associated with such a decrease . Crypt cell proliferation . The number of proliferating crypt cells was assessed on histological slides of small intestine stained by Ki67 antibody Figure 6A . The estimated basal proliferation index number of Ki67-positive cells per five crypts was 46.0�2.9 in the control group Figure 6Aa and B . At the time of hMSC injection 24 h after irradiation we observed a 21.5 % reduction in the level of proliferating crypt cells , falling to 36.1�1.5 data not shown . At 3 days , we observed a 2.8-fold increase in proliferating crypt cells Figure 6Ab and B . The percentage of proliferating cells increased in potential stem progenitor cells located in positions 4�6 of crypts increase of 37.2 % , in dividing transit cells increase of 6.8 % and in functional cells of crypt compartment increase of 84.8 % . We also observed a reduction in the percentage of potential stem cells intermingled with Paneth cells reduction of 31.3 % , Figure 6Bb . These results suggest that , 3 days after irradiation , the initiation of the small intestinal healing process seems to be under way . After hMSC infusion into irradiated mice , the crypt cell proliferation index peaks at a value of 206.3�9.9 increase of 61.0 % versus irradiated animals , Figure 6Ac and Ba . We showed that hMSC treatment into irradiated mice reduced the loss of potential stem cells intermingled with the Paneth cells decrease of 10.5 % versus irradiated animals , Figure 6Bb . hMSC treatment also increased the percentage of proliferating cells in compartments that usually contain functional cells , that is cells of crypts in positions 15�20 increase of 7.2 % versus irradiated animals and 92.0 % versus control animals and cells of villi increase of 10.2 % versus irradiated animals and 12.0 % versus control animals . Associated with the reduction in apoptosis , hMSC treatment also increases the proliferation of epithelial cells in the small intestine . Our results provide evidences that hMSC infusion into irradiated mice improves the self-renewal ability of small intestine and hence its restoration . Immunostaining of small intestinal stem cells . In control group , Musashi-1 immunostaining was preferentially detected in intermingled cells of Paneth cells but also in smaller proportion in position 4 ? of crypts Figure 6Ad . Three days after radiation exposure , Musashi-1 staining decreased considerably and became almost undetectable Figure 6Ae . After hMSC treatment into irradiated mice , Musashi-1 immunoreactivity was detected in equal proportion in intermingled cells of Paneth cells and in position 4 ? of crypts . Nevertheless , Musashi-1 detection was weaker in comparison with control group Figure 6Af . Labeling of successive small intestinal sections with , respectively , Musashi-1 and Ki67 antibodies indicates that Musashi-1-positive cells have a high activity of cell proliferation Figure 6Ag , h . Human MSC infusion extends life of mice with radiation-induced severe gastrointestinal disorders . The therapeutic potential of hMSC was then analyzed in a model of severe and irreversible gastrointestinal disorders leading to death . Mice were subjected to a lethal dose of abdominal irradiation 10.5 Gy . As previously , a total of 5 106 cells was infused in the lateral tail vein of mice 24 h after irradiation . The therapeutic benefit and cellular mechanisms of hMSC treatment on radiation-induced death were analyzed . Control IA IA+MSC Survival curve . We have shown that death occurs after 4�5 days in 100 % of mice subjected to abdominal irradiation at a 10.5 Gy dose. Figure 7 shows that a treatment with hMSC delays radiation-induced death compared with vehicle Po0.034 . Structural studies . Death of the animals occurring 5 days after irradiation 10.5 Gy was associated with significant ulceration of the small intestinal epithelium , corresponding to 80.0�15 % of the epithelium surface SEU Figure 8Aa and Ab . The infusion of hMSC into irradiated animals induced a non-significant P ? 0.4 reduction of the ulcerated epithelium surface , falling to 62�15 % Figure 8Ac . Cellular effects of hMSC infusion . Analyses were done on the margin of epithelial ulceration . After hMSC treatment , we observed a 2.5-fold reduction of radiation-induced apoptotic cells in crypt cell compartments Figure 8Ba . At this time , the infusion of hMSC into irradiated animals enhanced the number of crypt cells in proliferation increase of 109.9 % versus control , Figure 8Bb . Hence , 5 days after radiation-induced irreversible gastro-intestinal tract GIT lesions , the small intestinal epithelium on the margin of ulcerated areas keeps the proprieties of renewal when hMSC are administered . Discussion Our results reveal a therapeutic benefit of MSC treatment on radiation-induced gastrointestinal disorders . As described earlier , we reported that radiation-induced epithelial dysfunc-tions account for partial mucosal atrophy resulting from stem progenitor cell depletion , and therefore a subsequent impair-ment of epithelial self-renewal.3 We showed that MSC treatment 1 increases and accelerates the recovery of the small intestine with reversible alterations and 2 extends the life of animals developing irreversible gastrointestinal altera-tions . Histological evaluations provided initial insight into the cellular targets of therapy . MSC effects are a consequence of 100 ? m 100 ? m their ability to enhance or maintain the re-epithelization process of small intestinal epithelium . To our knowledge , this is the first demonstration that MSC therapeutic effects on small intestinal damage lead to the re-establishment of cellular homeostasis by both increasing endogenous prolif-eration processes and inhibiting apoptosis of radiation-induced intestinal epithelial cells . Our study shows an ability of MSC to accelerate structural restoration re-epithelization process of the small intestine , thus improving functional rescue . We report here the ability of MSC to bring about fast recovery of radiation-induced dysfunctions of the secretory response of small intestinal epithelium electrolyte and water transport , that is chloride secretion across epithelial cells . Stringent physiological regulation of chloride secretion , and thus also water secretion , into the lumen of intestine prevents or reduces the trans-epithelial migration of bacteria , bacterial products or antigens into the lamina propria , which could trigger an inappropriate and potentially chronic inflammatory response.12 We also showed MSC abilities to restore radiation-induced dysfunctions of the absorptive response of small intestinal epithelium membrane NA ? K ? -ATPase activity of epithelial cells . The activity of the NA ? K ? -ATPase pump maintains 100 80 animals 60 of % 20 Na ? , K ? and membrane potential gradient across the enterocyte membrane , which are driving forces for transport-ing most amino acids and or sugars.13 NA ? K ? -ATPase activity provides the electrochemical gradient that subse-quently increases the driving force for chloride efflux from epithelial cells across the apical membrane.13 MSC-induced re-establishment of membrane NA ? K ? -ATPase activity of small intestinal epithelial cells might be a precursor of chloride-secretion restoration and or could even maximize it . These two functional rescues induced by MSC infusion involve the re-establishment of an ionic gradient across the epithelial membrane . To our knowledge , there are no reports in the literature of such an in vivo ionic flux regulation by MSC in the GIT . Some in vivo electrophysiological experiments have revealed the capacity of MSC to increase conductance velocity reduction of conductance latency and enhancement of action potential number and amplitude of motor nerves14 and somatosensory nerves15 for functional recovery of injured peripheral nervous system . Moreover , an in vitro study has shown that MSC are able to repair cross-channel electrical conduction blocking in cardiomyocytes.16 Earlier authors have found evidence of trans-differentiation in the intestine after cell therapy after infusion of total BM cells . BM-derived cells could reside in the small intestine as late transit cells with limited dividing potential17 and , after injury , could in turn form specific epithelial cell lineages for organ restoration.18 In our study , the small number of human-derived cells implanted into the intestinal mucosa means that the replace-ment of epithelial cell loss by trans-differentiation is unlikely to represent the main therapeutic principle . Nevertheless , we reported that MSC are able to restore small intestinal integrity by maintaining cellular and tissue homeostasis , through the specific regulation of epithelial cells . MSC treatment produces an enhancement of radiation-induced epithelial crypt cell proliferation and reduces radiation-induced epithelial apopto-sis in the intestine . The contribution of MSC to increasing proliferation and or reducing apoptosis for organ rescue has been broadly shown in vivo for renal epithelial cells19 and nerve cells20 as a therapeutic benefit . Moreover , some results obtained in vitro show similar effects of MSC on the regulation of apoptosis and or proliferation of renal epithelial cells , 21 endothelial cells such as aortic cells , 22 brain microvascular cells23 and cardiomyocytes.24 Finally , convincing in vitro results obtained by Parekkadan et al.25 show , on the contrary , that MSC favor the death and reduce the proliferation of resident liver cells , specifically activated stellate cells . In the latter case , by limiting the activation of liver stellate cells , the authors suggest that MSC also have a therapeutic effect by preventing fibrosis . Our results seem to show that after radiation exposure , MSC treatment could maintain some active intestinal stem cells with ability of proliferation . Clevers and co-workers26 showed that a single intestinal stem cell can operate independently of positional cues from its environment and that it can generate a continuously expending , self-organizing epithelial structure , reminiscent of normal intes-tine . Hence , the partial rescue of intestinal stem cell level induced by MSC treatment could be sufficient to induce recovery of small intestinal integrity . MSC might regulate the epithelial stem progenitor cells directly or indirectly , that is stem cell niches that provide and maintain an optimal microenvironment for stem cell function . Several studies seem to support this hypothesis of secondary stem cell niche replenishment or restoration . First , MSC has already been described as maintaining stem cell niches , for example in BM.27 Second , BM-derived cells can be traced into the pericryptal and lamina proprial meshwork as sometimes observed in these experiments , giving rise to mesenchymal lineages that regulate epithelial cell proliferation and differ-entiation through mesenchymal�epithelial paracrine interac-tions.28 Recent studies have documented hMSC synthesis and release of several cytokines and growth factors such as , for instance , IL-11 , HGF , FGF-2 and IGF-I.29�31 Each of these factors has been described earlier as facilitating intestinal mucosa repair , either through enhancement of cell prolifera-tion or inhibition of epithelial cell apoptosis , or by a combination of both.32�35 The therapeutic benefit of MSC reported in this study could be the consequence of releases and synergic effects of multiple paracrine factors . Further research is needed to elucidate this complex issue . After MSC therapy , we report re-establishment of structural and cellular homeostasis over time . We can therefore exclude any subsequent running of out of control of MSC as affecting the regulation of small intestinal epithelium . tissue . This might reduce acute and or chronic side effects and may be of therapeutic interest . Small intestinal integrity analysis . Small intestinal integrity analysis was performed on samples harvested from NOD SCID mice subjected to a sub-lethal dose of irradiation . Mice received total body irradiation TBI at a dose of 3.5 Gy immediately followed by local irradiation to the abdomen at a dose of 5 Gy for a total dose of 8.5 Gy to the abdominal region .

20057501	www.nature.com cdd Adenosine production and release by stressed cells has been shown to have an important function in modulating tissue damage and repair.1 Among these effects , adenosine is re-garded as a key mediator in the development of cell tolerance to ischemia and reperfusion injury triggered by ischemic preconditioning IP .2�4 IP has been proposed as a simple procedure to reduce ischemia reperfusion injury after hepatic resection and orthotopic liver transplantation.5 However , the application of IP in hepatic surgery is limited by the high inter-individual variability of the responses , 6 indicating the need for a better inside in the mechanisms involved . The importance of adenosine in hepatic preconditioning is supported by the observation that targeted deletion of hepatic ecto-50-nucleotidase blocks adenosine generation during hy-poxia and abolishes liver protection by IP.7 The hepatocyte response to adenosine autocrine loop has been characterized to some extent showing that the stimulation of adenosine A2a receptors A2aR is coupled to the combined activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase Akt pathway and the novel protein kinases C nPKC , namely , PKCd and PKCe that on their turn lead to the stimulation of a network of protein kinases including p38 MAP kinase p38 MAPK 8,9 The membrane recruitment and activation of PKCd and PKCe is fully dependent on their direct interaction with diacylglycerol generated by A2aR-induced activation of phospholipase C-g , through a mechanism requiring both Src and PI3K activities.8,9 These finding are consistent with central role of nPKCs in the development of the protective action of IP in several tissues.10�12 An increasing body of evidence suggests that diacylglycerol signalling is also regulated by diacylglycerol kinases DGKs , which metabolize diacylglycerol to phosphatidic acid.13 DGKs are a family of enzymes encoded by 10 distinct genes , grouped in five structurally related classes.13 Accordingly , the genetic ablation of some DGK isoforms results in the de-regulated activation of specific diacylglycerol-mediated sig-nalling pathways.13 These observations suggest that the regulation of DGK activity may provide a strict control of the kinetic as well as of the extent of diacylglycerol signalling . However , direct evidence that extracellular ligands control intracellular diacylglycerol signalling by negative regulating specific DGK isoforms is still missing . Thus , we set to investigate whether negative regulation of a DGK activity might contribute to diacylglycerol-dependent activation of PKCd e on adenosine-induced hepatic preconditioning . Results Hypoxic preconditioning and activation of adenosine receptors negatively regulate DGKh in primary hepatocytes . We first investigated whether preconditioning of rat hepatocytes affected the total DGK activity . Figure 1a shows that hepatocyte preconditioning , obtained by the 10 min exposure to hypoxia followed by 10 min re-oxygenation , reduced total DGK activity by about 50 % . A similar effect was also induced by hepatocytes treatment with either adenosine 10 mM or CGS21680 1 mM , a specific A2aR agonist Figure 1b and c . Concomitantly , CGS21680 increased at least two-folds the intracellular diacylglycerol concentration Figure 1d . To identify the DGK isoforms putatively regulated by A2aR , DGK expression was investigated in primary hepatocytes by RT-PCR . DGKz , y and d were the most expressed isoforms , whereas DGKa was expressed at low levels and DGKb , g , e , Z and i were not expressed Figure 2 . We obtained no positive signals with several primer pairs for rat DGKk not shown . As the suppression of DGK-1 , the Caenorhabditis elegans orthologue of DGKy , positively regulates diacylglycerol in response to the serotonin receptor stimulation , 14,15 we set to investigate the regulation of DGKy in response to A2aR activation . The DGKy enzymatic activity measured in immunoprecipitates obtained using two distinct anti-DGKy antibodies raised against different epitopes was significantly reduced on CGS21680 stimulation Figure 3a and b , whereas DGKy protein expression was not affected Figure 3 . DGKy involvement was further confirmed by the use of a well-characterized anti-DGKy neutralizing antibody16 that decreased by about 80 % the recovered DGKy activity in immunoprecipitates Figure 3c . All together , these data indicate that the activation of A2aR provides a signal that negatively regulates DGKy activity , likely contributing to the sustained accumulation of diacylglycerol . RhoA-dependent inhibition of DGKh mediates A2aR-induced protection of hepatocytes from hypoxia - induced cell death . Biochemical evidence both in neuroblastoma17 and in C. elegans motoneurons14 shows that the enzymatic activity of DGKy and of its orthologue DGK-1 is strongly inhibited on direct interaction with the small GTPase RhoA.18 Thus , we set to investigate the interaction between active RhoA and DGKy in PC12 cells , , a rat cell line expressing A2aR19,20 transiently co-transfected with FLAG-tagged DGKy and myc-tagged RhoA . Consistently with earlier published data , 18 FLAG-DGKy co-immunoprecipited with constituitvely active myc-RhoA-V14 , but not with inactive myc-RhoA-N14 mutants from unstimulated cells Figure 4 . Moreover , FLAG-DGKy specifically co-precipitated with Figure 2 Characterization of the different diacylglycerol kinase DGK isoforms expressed in parenchimal liver cells . RT-PCR was used to verify the expression of the different DGKs in the HTC cell line and primary rat hepatocytes . Rat brain was used as positive control . GAPDH was used as loading control . The values above each band represent the densitometric analysis normalized by the value of the brain myc-RhoA in anti-myc immunoprecipitates from CGS21680-stimulated cells , but not from unstimulated cells Figure 4 . In the whole , these data confirmed that indeed DGKy is recruited in a complex with active RhoA . We then moved to investigate whether RhoA regulated DGKy activity on A2aR activation in primary rat hepatocytes . To this aim , we first verified whether RhoA was regulated by activation of A2aR . Indeed , on 15 min treatment , CGS21680 increased by 50 % RhoA�GTP complex , as measured by pull-down assay with immobilized rothekin-Rho binding domain Figure 5a and b . Such A2aR-induced activation of RhoA was insensitive to the addition of pertussis toxin data not shown . Next , to verify whether DGKy inhibition downstream from A2aR was mediated by RhoA�GTP , primary hepatocytes were treated with the cell permeable analogue of Clostridrium botulinum - Figure 3 Modulation of DGKy by the adenosineA2a receptor agonist CGS21680 . a , b DGKy was immunopurified with two different anti-DGKy antibodies Dgky-1 and Dgky-2 from extracts of hepatocytes treated with CGS21680 1 mM for 15 or 30 min . DGKy enzymatic activity was measured as reported in �Materials and methods� section . A representative experiment of phosphatidic acid PA determination is shown together with the quantification of three independent experiments . WB , represents western blot analysis of DGKy protein in total hepatocyte lysates after 30 min incubation with CGS21680 1 mM . The data are mean�S.E.M. of five replicates . Statistical significance *Po0.01 . c DGKy was immunopurified from hepatocytes and the enzymatic activity was measured in presence of control IgG or DGKy neutralizing antibodies DGKy ab as reported in �Materials and methods� section . Phosphatidic acid PA determination is shown in the lower panel . The values are mean�S.E.M. from a representative experiment performed in triplicate . Statistical significance *Po0.01 derived C3 transferase 1 mM , a highly specific RhoA inhibitor stabilizing RhoA in the inactive GDP-bound form . Inhibition of RhoA entirely reverted CGS21680-induced inhibition of DGKy Figure 5c , showing that RhoA�GTP mediated the inhibition of DGKy triggered on A2aR acti-vation . Moreover , the inhibition of RhoA by C3 tranferase abolished the protection against hypoxic injury in hepatocyte treated with CGS21680 Figure 5d . In the whole , these data showed that the cytoprotective signalling downstream from A2aR requires the activation of RhoA�GTPase followed by the inhibition of DGKy on binding of RhoA to its catalytic site . To provide further support to the claim that RhoA-mediated inhibition of DGKy contributed to A2aR-dependent signalling in preconditioning , we downregulated the expression of DGKy in HTC cells by specific siRNAs . HTC cells are rat Figure 4 The adenosineA2a receptor agonist CGS21680 promotes DGKy association with RhoA C GTPase . DGKy RhoA association was evaluated in PC12 cells transfected with FLAG-DGKy and either with wild-type myc-RhoA wt or constitutive active myc-RhoA-V14 active or inactive myc-RhoA-N19 inactive mutants . After trasfection , cells were serum starved for 24 h and treated with CGS21680 for 30 min . Cells were then lysed and transfection verified by western blotting and protein association was assessed after immunoprecipitation with anti-myc-specific antibodies using western blotting with anti-FLAG-specific antibodies hepatocyte-derived cell lines that , similar to primary hepato-cytes , undergoe an A2aR-mediated preconditioning.21 Downregulation of DGKy expression was obtained by transient transfection of two different specific siRNAs or a control siRNA and verified by western blot 48 h after transfection . As shown in Figure 6a , both anti-DGKy siRNAs specifically downregulated DGKy and not the other major hepatocytes DGK isoforms DGKa , d and z . On 60 min exposure to hypoxia , un-transfected cells and cells trans-fected with control siRNA underwent a significant loss of cell viability Figure 6b . Conversely , HTC cells transfected with either of the DGKy-specific siRNAs were fully protected from hypoxic damage , as were the cells pretreated with CGS21680 Figure 6b . Thus , these data show that specific down-regulation of DGKy isoform in HTC cells provides a sufficient signalling to induce tolerance to hypoxic damage . Pharmacological inhibition of DGK is sufficient to activate signals leading to hepatocyte resistance to hypoxic damage . To identify the key role played by the negative regulation of DGKy in mediating adenosine-induced preconditioning , led us investigate whether direct modulation of diacylglycerol turnover through pharmacological inhibition of DGK could induce hepatocytes resistance to hypoxic damage . The DGK inhibitor R59949 is known to preferentially inhibit DGKa , b , g and d isoforms , 22 whereas DGKz , one of the major DGK isoforms expressed in hepatocytes , is resistant to R5994922 and no information is available on the R59949 sensitivity to other DGK isoforms . Herein , we show that R59949 at 10 mM , but not at lower concentrations , effectively inhibited hepatocyte DGKy activity as assayed �in vitro� in anti-DGKy immunoprecipitates Figure 7a . Accordingly , in the same cells , 10 mM R59949 induced a sustained increase in intracellular diacylglycerol concentration Figure 7b . Pretreatment with R59949 also protected primary hepatocytes from hypoxia-induced cell death Figure 7c , whereas it did not affect viability of control cells . Moreover , in primary hepatocytes as well as in HTC cells , R59949 increased PKCd and PKCe activities in both membrane and cytosolic fractions Figure 8a . The extent of both diacylglycerol accumulation Figure 7b and enzymatic activation of PKCd and PKCe was highly similar to that induced by CGS21680-mediated activation of A2aR Figure 8a . Moreover , neither pharmacological inhibition of DGK nor A2aR stimulation promoted the enzymatic activities of PKCa , b1 and b2 , which are regulated by both calcium and diacylglycerol Figure 8a . We showed earlier that PKCd e-dependent phosphorylation of p38 MAPK is required for A2aR-induced protection from hypoxic damage.7 Con-sistently , R59949-mediated inhibition of DGK stimulated the dual phosphorylation Thr180 Tyr182 of p38 MAPK Figure 8b . The effect induced by DGK inhibition was comparable to that obtained by the activation of A2aR and was prevented by the PKC inhibitor chelerythrine 50 mM Figure 8b . Moreover , the inhibition of either PKC or p38 MAPK kinase with , respectively , chelerythrine or SB203580 5 mM abolished R59949-induced protective effects against hypoxic hepatocyte death Figure 7c . All together , these findings indicate that the pharmacological inhibition of DGK provides sufficient diacylglycerol accumulation to trigger PKC-mediated signals leading to resistance to hypoxic damage . Discussion It is increasingly clear that the development of IP in many tissues , including the liver , requires the activation of a complex network of signals comprising cell-surface receptors , redox signals and diverse arrays of protein kinases such as reperfusion injury salvage kinases that rapidly re-modulate several cell functions to better cope with energy loss , oxidative stress and ion unbalances associated with hypoxia and reperfusion.3,4,10,23,24 Among these protein kinases , PKCd and PKCe have a key function by coupling adenosine receptors to downstream stress-activated protein kinases Erk1 2 and p38 MAPKs.3,4,24 Moreover , translocation of PKCe to the mitochondria has been implicated in preventing mitochondrial permeability transition on myocardial reperfu-sion.25 PKCd and PKCe membrane recruitment and activation are fully dependent on their direct interaction with diacylgly-cerol , generated by adenosine-induced activation of phos-pholipase C-g and diacylglycerol analogues fully mimic the activation of the signals that onset IP.8,9,26 However , the accumulation of cellular diacylglycerol is dependent also on the rate of its rapid metabolism to phosphatidic acid by DGKs.13 Recent data indicate that the genetic deletion of specific DGK isoforms results in a sustained diacylglycerol signalling in different cell systems and tissues.13 Moreover , the role of DGKs as the terminator of diacylglycerol-mediated signals has been recently underscored by the finding that several DGK isoforms are recruited to the activated muscari-nic receptors , in which they rapidly metabolize diacylglycerol similarly to the action of phosphodiesterase towards cAMP.27 However , so far , no direct biochemical evidence is available for a receptor-mediated negative regulation of any DGK isoform . In this study , we show that in hepatocytes both hypoxic preconditioning and A2aR stimulation lead to a strong decrease in total DGK activity that contributes to diacylglycerol accumulation . In particular , we show that enzymatic activity of DGKy , that is , along DGKz the most abundant isoform in hepatocytes , is strongly inhibited on A2aR activation . This provides the first demonstration of a negative regulation of a DGK isoform by extracellular ligands . However , we can not rule out that other DGK isoforms beside DGKy may be inhibited on hepatocyte A2aR activation . Nevertheless , the demonstration that specific genetic downregulation of DGKy expression is sufficient to protect HTC hepatoma cells from hypoxic damage , indicates that the negative regulation of the DGKy isoform may be sufficient to trigger the onset of cytoprotective signals on A2aR activation by hypoxic preconditioning . The localization and function of DGKy have been reported earlier to be regulated by several G-protein coupled receptors , although the molecular mechanisms underlying such a regulation have not been fully investigated . For instance , in vascular smooth muscle cells purinergic receptors promote PKC-mediated recruitment of DGKy to the plasma mem-brane , whereas norepinephrine stimulates DGKy activity at lipid rafts.28�31 Herein , we show that on ligand stimulation of A2aR , RhoA is activated , binds and inhibits DGKy . Such an Rho-A signalling is required for A2aR-induced inhibition of DGKy as well as for the development of cytoprotection . These findings are consistent with the evidence that both DGKy and its C. elegans orthologue , DGK-1 are inhibited on the direct binding of active RhoA to their catalytic domain.18,32 More-over , in motoneurons of C. elegans , the activation of the RhoA orthologue , Rho-1 , leads to diacylglcyerol accumulation , which then allows the recruitment and activation of PKC-1 and UNC-13 proteins.33 Thus , our finding that in hepatocytes RhoA-mediated inhibition of DGKy triggers cytoprotective signalling downstream from A2a receptors , unveils the general relevance of a novel Rho-mediated signalling path-way linking G-protein coupled receptors to the negative re-gulation of DGKy activity . Such a novel pathway is conserved from C. elegans to different mammalian tissues and may enable G-protein coupled receptors to regulate the extent and the kinetics of diacylglycerol-mediated signalling , by fine-tuning the enzymatic activity of DGKy . This is also the first evidence for a direct activation of RhoA by A2aR , albeit in hepatic stellate cells A2aR has been reported recently to mediate RhoA inhibition through the cAMP-mediated activa - tion of protein kinase A.34 It is known that G-protein coupled receptors activate RhoA�GTPases , by coupling the pertussis toxin insensitive Ga12 13 or Gaq 11 proteins to , respectively , p115 or Trio RhoGEFs.35 Moreover , previous evidence indicates that A2aR couples to Ga12 13 in endothelial cells.36 On the other hand , A2aR-induced activation of hepatocyte RhoA is pertussis toxin insensitive , suggesting that it may be mediated through either Ga12 13 or Gaq 1137 and ruling out the involvement of inhibitory G Gai -proteins , which instead transduce A2aR-induced Src-mediated signalling to PI3-kinase and PLC-g.9 These findings indicate that A2aRs by interacting with , respectively , Gai or Ga12 13 q 11 GTPases promote both the PLC-g-mediated diacylglycerol synthesis and , at the same time , inhibit diacylglycerol catabolism by DGK Figure 9 . Thus , the accumulation of diacylglycerol required for preconditioning-induced PKCd e activation results from the fine-tuning of the enzymes responsible for both diacylglycerol generation and catabolism . Such an interpretation is consistent with a growing body of evidence suggesting that the temporal and spatial regula-tion of intracellular second messengers depends on the simultaneous reciprocal regulation of both activating and de-activating enzymes , such as adenylate cyclase and phosphodiesterase for cAMP , and PI3-kinase and PTEN for PI 3,4,5 P3.38,39 Moreover , these observations underscore the relevance of negative regulators for the transduction of the complex signals required for the onset of the cytoprotective machinery in IP . In this latter respect , a decline in the activity of PTEN is evident in parallel with PI3K activation during brain and myocardium preconditioning.40,41 By unveiling that the RhoA-mediated-negative regulation of DGKy is essential for Figure 9 Proposed role of DGKy inhibition and phospholypase C activation in the recruitment of protein PKC-dependent survival pathways responsible for inducing the resistance to hypoxia of preconditioned hepatocytes . During hepatocytes preconditioning , adenosine A2 receptor A2aR stimulation induces RhoA C activation and an RhoA C-dependent inhibition of DGKy activity . The consequent decrease in diacylglycerol DAG metabolism to phosphatidic acid PA allows a stable increase in DAG intracellular level that maintains the activation of the DAG-dependent cytoprotective signals A2aR-dependent hepatocyte preconditioning , these results suggest that the pharmacological inhibition of DGK may likely trigger cytoprotection . Indeed , the treatment of primary hepatocytes with the DGK inhibitor R59949 is sufficient to induce adequate diacylglycerol accumulation to activate diacylglycerol-dependent nPKCs , fully protecting hepatocytes from hypoxic damage . On pharmacological inhibition of DGK , adequate diacylglycerol levels likely build from the unstimu-lated basal phospholipids turnover , even in absence of a receptor-mediated activation of PLC-g . At the concentrations used in this study , R59949 inhibits several DGK isoforms including DGKy , DGKd and DGKa , but does not affect DGKz , which is along with DGKy the most abundant DGK isoform expressed in hepatocytes . Thus , the inhibition of DGKy may be largely responsible for R59949-induced protection , although we can not rule out the involvement of other DGKs , such as DGKd and DGKa . In conclusion , the data presented characterize a novel signalling pathway in the mechanisms by which adenosine promotes hepatic preconditioning involving DGKy down-regulation . These findings indicate DGK modulation as a potential target of new pharmacological strategies aimed to induce tolerance to ischemia reperfusion injury in organs such as the liver , the myocardium and the kidney , which relay on nPCK activity for the development of the cytoprotective effects of preconditioning .

20057502	in vivo A fundamental unit of chromatin is the nucleosome which is composed of two sets of histones H2A , H2B , H3 and H4 that are wrapped with 146 base pairs of DNA.1 Histones have a tail in the N-terminal domain which is free from DNA and often has various covalent modifications.2 In recent studies , it was shown that epigenetic histone modification has an important role in chromatin function leading to the hypothesis that histone modification acts as a �histone code� possibly for chromatin remodeling.3 In most apoptotic cells , internucleo-somal degradation is considered a late biochemical hallmark of apoptosis.4,5 Previously we demonstrated that histone H2B is phosphorylated in various mammalian apoptotic cells6,7 and can be phosphorylated by PKC both in vitro and in vivo.6,8 In addition , we determined that the site of the H2B phosphoryla-tion is serine 14 S14 and can involve the action of Mst-1 in vivo.9 This S14 site can also be phosphorylated with PKC-d in human B cells , 10 and S14 phosphorylation has been associated with apoptosis9 and with DNA double strand breaks.11 However , the mechanisms regulating H2B phos-phorylation at S14 , particularly during apoptosis , are unknown . Histone H2B has also been reported to be acetylated at the K5 , K12 , K15 and K20 sites12 which could potentially regulate the phosphorylation of S14 in the N-terminus of H2B . For example , it has been recently shown that phosphorylation of S10 in the yeast histone H2B , homologous to S14 in mammals , was regulated by K11 acetylation.13,14 To examine this question in mammalian cells we employed rat primary thymocytes induced by glucocorticoids to undergo apoptosis a system used for both in vivo and in vitro analysis of apoptotic signal transduction.15�17 We previously found that histone H2B was phosphorylated during the induction of apoptosis.6 In this report , we examined the regulatory mechanism of the apoptosis-specific S14 H2B phosphorylation in relation to internucleosomal DNA degradation and deacetylation of the K15 lysine . Results Glucocorticoids induce apoptosis in thymocytes . The induction of thymocyte apoptosis by dexamethasone was initially analyzed by flow cytometry Figure 1A . Thymocytes treated with 1 mM dexamethasone for 4 h contain a population of cells showing reduced forward-scatter light but increased side-scatter light . This occurrence of a shrunken , granular population of cells is characteristic of programmed cell death Figure 1A , d . In contrast , this cell NC , USA A 1000 scatter 0 Side 1000 B Con Dex population develops only to a small extent 2.9 versus 26.6 % in Dex treated in the non-glucocorticoid-treated control cells incubated at 371C and is not detected in freshly isolated cells or cells incubated on ice for 4 h . This 2.9 % of cells seen in our control sample likely reflects spontaneous apoptosis of these cells in culture Figure 1A , c . Ultrastructural analysis of thymocytes by electron microscopy shows distinct areas of euchromatin and heterochromatin light and dark staining , respectively in the nuclei of control thymocytes Figure 1B , left in contrast to apoptotic cells , wherein nuclear components appear degraded and showed homogeneous dark staining Figure 1B , right . Analysis of DNA by agarose gel electrophoresis Figure 1C shows the characteristic pattern of internucleosomal DNA cleavage in nuclei from apoptotic thymocytes . After 4 h incubation of thymocytes with dexamethasone , only lower molecular weight DNA was observed in the soluble chromatin fraction Figure 1C , lane 4 . Together these observations indicate that glucocorticoid treatment for 4 h is sufficient to induce classic apoptotic DNA fragments in rat thymocytes . Phosphorylated histone H2B at S14 is abundant in the soluble chromatin . Degraded DNA fragments with their associated histones are separable from whole genomic DNA based on their solubility in non-ionic detergent . Soluble chromatin from thymocytes exposed to 4 h of 1 mM dexamethasone was analyzed by SDS gel electrophoresis Figure 2a . The relative amount of histones H1 , H2A , H2B , H3 and H4 present in the soluble chromatin fraction increased in a time-dependent manner upon incubation with dexamethasone , indicating the release of histones from chromatin during apoptosis . In the control cells incubated for 6 h without dexamethasone , only small amounts of histones were also released , which likely reflects spontaneous apoptosis of a small percentage of our cultured cells.18 To analyze the amount of apoptosis-specific H2B phos-phorylation at Ser14 in the soluble chromatin , a western blot against anti-phosSer14 H2B was conducted Figure 2b . After 4 h of dexamethasone treatment , the amount of phosS14 is significantly increased in the soluble fraction , compared with the insoluble fraction of chromatin Figure 2b , left . In contrast , other histone modifications such as H4 acetylation at K8 are present in both the soluble and insoluble fraction in roughly equivalent amounts Figure 2b , right . These data suggest that histone H2B phosphorylation is selectively associated with histone release and internucleosomal DNA degradation during apoptosis . Intracellular distribution of S14 phosphorylation in apoptotic cells . Next , we evaluated the distribution of the phosS14 in thymocytes by immunofluorescence Figure 3A . Thymocytes treated with 1 mM dexamethasone for 4 h or left untreated were stained with anti-phosS14 antibody red and DAPI blue . There was an increase in cells that were positive for phosS14 in dexamethasone-treated cells Figure 3A , 1 and 2 . To determine whether the H2B phosphorylation is associated with degraded DNA , thymocytes were examined by immunofluorescence of phosS14 Figure 3B , a , TUNEL C 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 hr U C staining Figure 3B , b , merge of both Figure 3B , c and DAPI Figure 3B , d . As shown in Figure 3B , cells positive for phosS14 are also TUNEL positive . It is interesting to note that not all TUNEL positive cells stain with phosS14 because the TUNEL reaction occurs in both high molecular weight HMW DNA fragments and internucleosomal DNA fragments , whereas phosphorylation of S14H2B occurs primarily in internucleosomal DNA fragments . Alterations in histone acetylation at K15 within histone H2B . Although no significant difference in the acetylation of histone H4 at K8 was observed between soluble and insoluble chromatin Figure 2b , we were interested in possible changes in the level of acetylation of other sites in histone H2B. Figure 4a shows the amino acid sequence and known sites of modifications of H2B at the N-terminal tail . There are four major acetylation sites in H2B K5 , K12 , K15 and K20 .12 We focused our studies on lysine 15 because of its proximity to S14 . Thus , we examined the level of lysine 15 acetylation and S14 phosphorylation in both soluble and insoluble chromatin fractions of apoptotic nuclei from glucocorticoid-treated thymocytes . Histones were isolated from soluble and insoluble chromatin obtained from dexa-methasone-treated thymocytes . Total chromatin was ob-tained from untreated control cells . Figure 4b shows western blots for the acetylation site at K15 acK15 and the phosphorylation of S14 phosS14 . PhosS14 is more abun-dant in the soluble than the insoluble fraction from 4 h dexamethasone-treated thymocytes , and is much greater than the amount in control Figure 4b , C . In contrast , acK15 was abundant in the control and insoluble fraction but was reduced in the soluble fraction of dexamethasone-treated thymocytes . Therefore , K15 appeared to be highly acetylated in the H2B histones in chromatin from control cells , but partially deacetylated following the induction of apoptosis by dexamethasone . Using synthetic peptide substrates , each a a a p a a c N-PEPAKSRPAPKKGSKKAVTKAQKKDGK�. . b phosS14 acK15 d phosS14 C Dex UV W ________ Dt At - acK15 - specific antibody was evaluated for its ability to recognize its respective epitope acetylated-lysine K15 or phosphorylated S14 . Adjacent acetylation and or phosphorylation had no significant influence on the ability of the antibodies to recognize their appropriate substrates see supplementary data S1 . To evaluate whether this reciprocal change occurs between deacetylation of K15 and phosphorylation at S14 during apoptosis of thymocytes in vivo , we injected rats with dexamethasone and after 18 h the thymus was dissected , sectioned and examined by immunohistochemistry . The control thymus tissue was strongly stained with anti-acK15 Figure 4c , 3 , whereas staining was less pronounced in dexamethasone-treated tissue Figure 4c , 4 , indicating H2B histones are deacetylated at K15 following treatment . In contrast , staining for phosS14 was minimal in the tissue from controls Figure 4c , 7 , but abundant in the thymus of the dexamethasone-treated animals . This staining was concentrated in the thymic cortex area that harbors immature T cells , which are particularly sensitive to glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis Figure 4c , 8 . Together these data suggest that the switch between K15 deacetylation and Table 1 Summary of results from Figures 4b� and HL-60 cells Cells Agents Fractions phosS14 S14 phosphorylation also occurs after glucocorticoid - treatment in vivo . An important question that arises from our studies is whether this epigenetic switch also occurs during apoptosis in other cell types . To address this issue we used HTC cells as a model system . This cell line undergoes apoptosis upon UV-C irradiation or Fas ligand treatment19 but not with glucocorticoid treatment , despite the presence of an intact glucocorticoid-receptor signaling system.19 After the induction of apoptosis in HTC cells , some cells remained attached to a glass substratum At , and approximately 30 % of the cells are detached and are floating in the medium Dt . We observed an increase in the phosphorylation of S14 in the detached UV-C or Fas ligand-treated apoptotic cells Figure 4d , Dt compared with the attached cells Figure 4d , At . In contrast , K15 acetylation was reduced upon induction of apoptosis and release from the substratum , which is a reflection of their state of apoptosis . Similar results were also observed when studying apoptosis of HL-60 , a human promyelocytic leukemic cell line , induced by etoposide data not shown . It is important to note that HTC cells treated with glucocorticoids Figure 4d , Dex show no significant difference compared with control cells in their levels of K15 acetylation and S14 phosphoryla-tion . The fact that we detected no increase in phosS14 in dexamethasone-treated HTC cells is strong evidence that this epigenetic event is specifically related to apoptosis and not simply a result of glucocorticoid administration , as these cells are known to be glucocorticoid responsive.19 Together these data summarized in Table 1 indicate that the switch between deacetylation of K15 and phosphorylation of S14 in H2B occurs during apoptosis of primary cells as well as established cell lines . Furthermore , this switch appears to be independent of the type of apoptotic stimulus used to initiate the cell death process . Effect of TSA on the S14 phosphorylation in thymocytes . In an attempt to understand the components of the mechanisms involved in glucocorticoid regulation of epigenetic chromosomal remodeling , we examined the effect of TSA , an inhibitor of histone deacetylases , on the acK15 and phosS14 in thymocytes Figure 5A . In thymocytes treated with TSA alone , acK15 was markedly increased Figure 5A , left . In addition , the amount of acK15 remained high in cells treated with TSA plus dexamethsone , whereas phosS14 increased in the dexamethasone-treated thymocytes but remained at control levels in cells treated with dexamethasone plus TSA Figure 5A , right . Our data suggest that a histone deacetylase is either activated or induced in glucocorticoid-treated thymocytes and consequently acK15 is deacetylated . Thus deacetylation of K15 allows the phosphorylation of S14 , further suggesting that they have a reciprocal relationship . We also examined the DNA degradation and histone release in the soluble chromatin fraction obtained from isolated nuclei Figure 5B . DNA from cells treated with dexamethasone displays a ladder pattern indicating inter-nucleosomal degradation lane C in the Figure 5B left , which is not seen in the two controls lanes A and B . However , the cells treated with either TSA alone lane D or dexamethasone plus TSA showed almost no internucleosomal degradation lanes E and F . The histone release assay also showed that TSA treatment alone had very little effect on the release of histones lanes D and E in the Figure 5B , right . This lack of internucleosomal degradation under these conditions was not the result of arresting the apoptotic program , as cells treated with TSA alone , Dex alone or TSA plus Dex for 6 h still underwent apoptosis , as judged by annexin-V binding and caspase activation Figure 5C . Together these data indicate that deacetylation of histones is crucial to internucleosomal cleavage of DNA during apoptosis . Phosphorylation assay of synthetic H2B peptides . To gain further insight into the kinases and mechanisms involved in S14 phosphorylation we examined the effect of acetylation of K15 on the ability of S14 to be phosphorylated using synthetic H2B peptides in vitro . Figure 6a shows the 16 amino acid peptide substrates of H2B from the arginine 7 R7 to glutamine 22 Q22 . One peptide , acK15 , is acetylated at K15 , and one , phosS14 , is phosphorylated at S14 . The control peptide has no modification . These three peptides were tested for their ability to be phosphorylated by PKC , which is a protein kinase known to be responsible for the phosphorylation of the N-terminal H2B.6,9 Figure 6b indicates the incorporation of 32P into the three different synthetic H2B peptides by the PKC phosphorylation assay . The incorporation of 32P into phosS14 peptide was negligible 1.7 % , as the S14 site was already phosphorylated . The phosphorylation was suppressed nearly 35 % in the acK15 peptide . These data suggest that acetylation at K15 can inhibit the phosphorylation of S14 in vitro . Our results indicate that the phosphorylation of S14 in histone H2B occurs during apoptosis of thymocytes and is abundant in the soluble or degraded chromatin fraction of apoptotic cells . In contrast , very little S14 H2B phosphorylation is found A AU 15 a M A B C D E F G in the insoluble chromatin fraction of apoptotic or normal control cells . We also show that K15 is acetylated in normal cells but this modification is greatly diminished during the activation of apoptosis . In addition , we present evidence that K15 deacetylation is necessary to allow S14 H2B phosphorylation and inhibiting this deacetylation step inhibits internucleosomal DNA degradation . There are two major steps of DNA degradation during apoptosis . One is the production of HMW DNA fragments and the other is internucleosomal DNA degradation . In the early stage of apoptosis , HMW DNA fragments are produced and this is necessary for the subsequent internucleosomal DNA degradation . Our findings indicate that deacetylation of K15 and S14 phosphorylation associates with internucleosomal DNA degradation . Other histone modifications are known to occur during apoptosis such as H4 acetylation , 20 H4 trimethylation , 21 H3 methylation and phosphorylation22,23 and H1 dephosphorylation.24 Together with H2B phosphor-ylation , these histone modifications may occur in the same chromatin domain and may work cooperatively . Our data also reveal that K15 is acetylated in normal rat thymocytes , but during the activation of apoptosis this acetylation is decreased as the phosphorylation of S14 is increased . It has been reported that the N-terminal tail of H2B itself is crucial for chromatin condensation.25 Moreover , the H2B acetylation at the N-terminal end is important to maintain a stable structure of H2A�H2B dimers in the nucleosome.26,27 As the N-terminal domain of H2B including the S14 site exists outside the nucleosome structure , 28 it could be susceptible to modification by phosphatases or kinases if left unprotected . Deacetylation of K15 seems to be necessary for the phosphorylation of S14 , whereas acetylation of K15 may prevent the S14 phosphorylation . These observations sug-gest that acetylation of K15 in normal cells could be functionally important in protecting cells from irreversible apoptotic DNA degradation . In this regard we previously demonstrated in HL-60 cells that one of the kinases responsible for the S14 phosphorylation is Mst-1 , although PKC-d has also been reported to phosphorylate this site in immune cells.8 Mst-1 is activated by caspase-38 and can then translocate from cytoplasm to nucleus.29,30 This study demonstrates an interesting epigenetic switch between two amino-acid modifications in the N-terminus of H2B that occurs during apoptosis in mammalian cells . A similar relationship has been reported for the phosphorylation at Ser10 interacting with the adjacent K9 methylation sites in H3.31 Intriguingly , we have shown that the H2B phosphoryla-tion could be a prerequisite for apoptosis execution in various mammalian cells resulting from several apoptotic agents.6,9 Recently , it has been shown that H2B phosphorylation occurs during oxidative stress in yeast at Ser10 , which is homologous to S14 in vertebrates.13 These authors suggest a specific deacetylation at K11 and phosphorylation at S10 at the histone H2B tail required for cell death in yeast.14 There are numerous reports that general histone deacety-lase inhibition causes apoptosis.32 Indeed in our studies using the non-specific histone deacetylase inhibitor TSA we show that it alone can cause cell death . However , we also demonstrate that TSA prevented internucleosomal DNA degradation induced by glucocorticoids , as well as hyperace-tylating K15H2B and inhibiting S14H2B phosphorylation . Thus , during apoptosis K15 is likely deacetylated by endogenous HDAC�s in a more specific manner . Previously , we have shown that CAD DT40 chicken cells treated with VP16 had a pSer14 positive reaction that could be detected by immunocytochemistry.9 Within cell nuclei , the pSer14 reaction was co-localized with DAPI dense chromatin suggesting that pSer14 is associated with chroma-tin condensation rather than caspase-dependent internucleo-somal DNA fragmentation . In the current studies using primary thymocytes from adrenalectomized rats we observed that phosS14 H2B during thymocyte apoptosis seemed mainly localized at the periphery of nuclei which yet does not show clear condensation Figure 1B . This difference in the structure of chromatin and the localization of phosS14 may be a reflection of cell type or the apoptotic agent used for the induction of cell death . The epigenetic switch between the two-histone modifica-tions in H2B could induce a change of nucleosome structure in the H2B tail at specific regions of chromatin , and the remodeling of that chromatin domain would facilitate the accessibility for endonucleases . These findings are important for the structural analysis of nucleosomes during apoptosis , especially the interaction between covalent histone modifica-tion and internucleosomal DNA degradation . Materials and Methods Isolation of thymocytes and induction of apoptosis . Male Sprague Dawley rats 2�3 month of age were used and the animals were bilaterally adrenalectomized by the provider at least 5 days before use . They were maintained under controlled conditions of temperature 251C and lighting , and allowed free access to food and 0.85 % saline .

20057503	Parkinson�s disease PD is a frequent neurodegenerative disorder resulting from massive degeneration of the dopami-nergic neurons in the substantia nigra . Although most cases are sporadic , several genes are known to cause familial PD , especially with early onset.1 Mutations in the PINK1 gene are the second most frequent cause of autosomal recessive PD after those in the Parkin gene.2,3 The PINK1 gene encodes a serine�threonine kinase with an N-terminal mitochondrial import sequence , first characterized as a protein aimed at maintaining mitochondrial integrity and preventing apoptosis in response to cellular stressors.2,4�8 This neuroprotective role is partly exerted through phosphorylation of the mitochondrial chaperon , TRAP1 , although cytoplasm-restricted PINK1 was also shown to protect against MPTP damage.9,10 The full-length PINK1 PINK1-FL is processed within mitochondria to generate two mature proteins 4,11 all three isoforms localize both to the mitochondria and cytosol , their relative ratio being regulated by several factors.10�13 Increasing data have demonstrated that absence of functional PINK1 induces abnormalities of mitochondrial morphology.6,14,15 In several studies mostly in Drosophila , PINK1 was shown to promote fission acting upstream of the Fis1�Drp1 machinery , and the mitochondrial phenotype observed in PINK1 knockout flies or silenced cells was associated to reduced fission.16,17 Subsequent studies in mammalian cell systems contradicted these results , demon-strating that mutant or silenced PINK1 resulted in increased fragmentation.15,17�19 A major progress in this field has come from the finding that PINK1 interacts with Parkin to regulate mitochondrial dynamics . Parkin overexpression was found to rescue the mitochondrial abnormalities observed in PINK1 knockout flies and silenced cells but not vice versa , suggesting that Parkin may act downstream of PINK1 in a common pathway.14,15,19 It has been recently shown that Parkin is directly recruited to dysfunctional mitochondria mediating their elimination through mitophagy , 20 and that stable silencing of PINK1 induces an increase in oxidative stress levels , which activates both mitophagy and mitochondrial fission.19 Mitophagy is a tightly regulated autophagy-based mechanism that has a central role in mitochondria quality control , by selectively eliminating damaged mitochondria before they could activate apoptosis.21 Indeed , autophagy is being increasingly recog-nized as an essential homeostatic process to clear misfolded or aggregated proteins and to ensure organellar turnover . The role of autophagy seems even more relevant in aging non-mitotic cells , such as neurons , in which damaged cellular components can not be diluted through recurring cell division cycles.22 Compelling evidence now indicates a protective role of autophagy against neurodegeneration . Dysfunctional auto-phagy has been implicated in a growing number of neurode-generative diseases , including PD , that share the pathoge-netic pathways of mitochondrial abnormalities and misfolded protein damage.22�24 Interestingly , the fission protein Fis1 was found to activate the autophagy pathway , 25 and it has been proposed that mitochondria fusion fission machinery and mitophagy could represent a �quality control axis� , regulating mitochondrial dynamics and function.26 Although in PINK1-deficient cells mitophagy seems to depend on mitochondrial fission , 19 Parkin-activated mitophagy seems independent from its effects on mitochondrial morphology , suggesting that the two mechanisms can be regulated together or in parallel.20 Here , we present evidence that PINK1-FL , but not its cleaved isoforms or a mutant protein truncated at the C-terminus , interacts with the pro-autophagic protein Beclin1 and enhances autophagy . This effect results from an increase of the autophagic flux and is , at least , partly mediated through the Beclin1�Vps34 complex , suggesting a main role for PINK1 in this fundamental cellular pathway . PINK1 interacts with the pro-autophagic protein Beclin1 . In search of PINK1 interactors using a yeast two-hybrid approach , we screened a human brain cDNA library and obtained a strong interaction with the PINK1 N-terminal region aa 1�100 Figure 1a . Sequencing of the prey cDNA and subsequent bioinformatic analysis showed that it corresponded to the BECN1 gene , encoding Beclin1 . To confirm the yeast two-hybrid data , we performed in vitro GST pull down using different PINK1 constructs , and detected a strong interaction between PINK1-FL and Beclin1 . The interaction was mildly reduced on removing the first 77 amino acids of PINK1 , but less than halved on removing the whole N-terminus 1�112 aa , and completely abolished when the C-terminus was also deleted Figure 1b . These results confirmed that PINK1-FL binds Beclin1 in vitro , and sug-gested that the interaction involves both its N-and C-terminal regions . To assess whether Beclin1 could be a substrate of PINK1 , we performed an in vitro kinase assay using GST�PINK177�581 and observed no phosphorylation of Beclin1 data not shown . Deletion of PINK1 N-or C-terminal regions , but not loss of its kinase activity , impairs Beclin1 binding in vivo . To test the interaction between PINK1-FL and Beclin1 in vivo , we performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments in HeLa cells co-transfected with HA-tagged PINK1 and Beclin1 . In line with pull-down results , we showed that PINK1-FL strongly co-immunoprecipitated Beclin1 Figure 2a . As no reliable antibodies are available to immunoprecipitate endogenous PINK1,8,27 we next demonstrated that endogenous Beclin1 specifically co-immunoprecipitated PINK1-FL , whereas no bands were observed corresponding to PINK1-cleaved isoforms Figure 2b . The binding between Beclin1 and PINK1-FL was further confirmed by immunoprecipitating endogenous Beclin1 in SH-SY5Y cells stably expressing PINK1-FL Figure 2c . We then generated several HA-tagged PINK1-deleted and mutant constructs . We selected two PINK1 pathogenic mutations p.W437X and p.G309D , 2 with similar stability and subcellular localization in comparison with the wild-type protein.28 Mutant PINK1W437X lacks the C-terminus and part of the kinase domain , yet it partly maintains the ability to phosphorylate specific substrates such as TRAP1 . Conversely , kinase activity is lost by the missense mutant PINK1G309D.9 PINK1 constructs lacking either the N-terminus PINK1112�581 or the C-terminus PINK11�496 , mutant PINK1W437X showed a marked reduction of Beclin1 co-immunoprecipitation . Conver-sely , PINK1G309D�Beclin1 co-immunoprecipitation was compar-able with PINK1-FL Figure 2d . To validate these results in a different experimental approach , we used fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy FLIM , a confocal microscopy-based fluorescence reso-nance energy transfer FRET technique , which can reveal protein�protein interactions in vivo . We performed FLIM on HeLa cells transiently co-transfected with PINK1-FL , deleted or mutant constructs and Beclin1 . Immunostaining of PINK1-FL with donor fluorophore generated a lifetime value that markedly decreased when Beclin1 also was co-stained with the acceptor fluorophore , indicating interaction of the two proteins . A similar reduction of donor lifetime could be observed on co-staining PINK1G309D and Beclin1 conversely , co-immunostaining PINK1112�581 , PINK11�496and PINK1W437X with Beclin1 did not result in significant reduc-tions of donor lifetime . To assess FLIM specificity , we performed a further experiment testing PINK1-FL and Calnexin , a marker of the endoplasmic reticulum ER known not to co-localize with PINK1 , but could observe no interaction Figure 3 . Equivalent results were obtained in all experiments when acceptor and donor were exchanged data not shown . Taken together , co-immunoprecipitation and FLIM ex-periments confirmed that Beclin1 strongly interacts with 50 PINK1 40 60 Beclin1 PINK1-FL but not with its cleaved isoforms or the truncated PINK1W437X mutant in vivo . Our data suggest that the ability of PINK1 to bind Beclin1 is influenced by the lack of both the N-and C-terminal domains but not by its kinase activity . Both PINK1 and Beclin1 localize to the mitochondrial compartment . To assess the extent of co-localization of PINK1 and Beclin1 , we transiently co-transfected PINK1-FL and Beclin1 in different cell types . Confocal microscopy analysis indicated evident co-localization of the two proteins both in HeLa and SH-SY5Y cells , which did not change after starvation , a potent inducer of the autophagic response Figure 4a and Supplementary Figure 1 . On testing PINK1-deleted and mutant constructs in HeLa cells , co-localization with Beclin1 did not significantly change for PINK1112�581or PINK1G309D , whereas it appeared to be variably reduced for PINK11�496 or PINK1W437X . It should be noted that the overlap coefficient for Beclin1 and PINK1112�581 is likely to be overestimated because of the diffuse localization of both proteins Figure 4b . We next asked where the interaction between PINK1 and Beclin1 could take place within the cell . By performing confocal microscopy experiments with organelle-specific markers , we confirmed that PINK1 localizes mainly to the mitochondria , with only a small proportion of it localizing to other compartments12,28 Figure 4c and Supplementary Figure 2a . Mitochondrial localization did not significantly change for PINK11�496 , PINK1W437X and PINK1G309D , whereas PINK1112�581 presented diffuse cytoplasmic locali-zation , as expected Figure 4e . In previous studies , Beclin1 has been detected within mitochondria , ER and the trans-Golgi network.29 We observed that Beclin1 localized con-siderably to mitochondria and , in lesser proportion , to the ER , whereas we failed to identify co-localization with Golgi or lysosome markers Figure 4d and Supplementary Figure 2b . These findings indicate mitochondria as the only subcellular compartment in which both proteins abundantly localize , although they also seem to have partial cytosolic localization . To assess whether PINK1 could influence the mitochondrial distribution of endogenous Beclin1 , we performed sub-fractionation experiments on SH-SY5Y cells stably overexpressing PINK1-FL or PINK1W437X ability of which to bind Beclin1 is impaired . We were able to detect endogenous Beclin1 in both mitochondrial and cytoplasmic microsomal fractions , with no significant differences between the two cell lines , as well as in a control cell line . Similarly , we observed no differences in PINK1-FL distribution when Beclin1 was either overexpressed or silenced Figure 4f . Beclin1 distribution also did not change when PINK1-FL or PINK1W437X were transiently co-transfected with Beclin1 or when Beclin1 was expressed alone data not shown . Thus , it seems that the interaction between PINK1 and Beclin1 is not relevant for the mitochondrial distribution of both proteins . PINK1-FL , but not pathogenic mutant PINK1W437X , enhances autophagy . As the main role of Beclin1 is to promote autophagosome formation and maturation , 29,30 we reasoned that PINK1 could interact with Beclin1 to modulate autophagy . Two complementary strategies , based on immunofluorescence and western blotting , were optimized to detect autophagy . We first transiently overexpressed PINK1-FL in SH-SY5Y cells stably expressing GFP�LC3 under nutrient-rich and starvation conditions , and compared the number of PINK1-expressing and non-expressing cells that were positive for GFP�LC3 vacuoles , indicative of activated autophagy Figure 5a . In nutrient-rich conditions , PINK1-FL overexpression induced a nearly three-fold increase in the number of vacuole-positive cells compared with untransfected cells . Under starvation , the number of autophagic untransfected cells increased about three times compared with basal condition , and PINK1-FL overexpression produced a further significant increase of autophagic cells compared with starved control Figure 5b . Notably , we did not observe any co-localization of PINK1 with the GFP�LC3 dots under nutrient-rich and starvation conditions Supplementary Figure 3 . To confirm the ability of PINK1 to enhance autophagy , we monitored the conversion of endogenous LC3 from the cytoplasmic LC3-I , 18 kDa to the membrane-bound form LC3-II , 16 kDa in SH-SY5Y cells stably expressing PINK1 . In this system , we quantified autophagy by assessing the LC3-II LC3-I ratio , as we observed that , in SH-SY5Y cells , autophagy activation was variably associated with LC3-II increase and or LC3-I decrease.31 Under both nutrient-rich and starvation conditions , PINK1-FL cells showed a significant increase of the LC3-II LC3-I ratio compared with control cells . Activation of autophagy was further confirmed by showing reduction of P62 levels in cells expressing PINK1 versus controls Figure 5c . To explore whether the observed results actually repre-sented an increase of autophagy , we treated cells with the lysosomal protease inhibitor ammonium chloride , NH4Cl , that prevents the degradation of autophagosomes . Immuno-fluorescence analysis showed that GFP�LC3 punctae dramatically increased under starvation conditions . In western blotting , treatment with NH4Cl induced an evident accumulation of LC3-II in both cell lines Figure 5d . These findings suggest that PINK1-induced autophagy results from a true enhancement of the autophagic flux and not from the blockage of autophagic degradation.32 We next knocked down PINK1 expression using RNAi in GFP�LC3 and wild-type SH-SY5Y cells , obtaining 60 and 80 % decline of PINK1 mRNA expression , respectively . In immunofluorescence experiments , PINK1 silencing induced a significant decrease of starvation-induced autop-hagy when compared with control cells , which was confirmed by a reduction of the LC3-II LC3-I ratio in western blotting Figures 5e and f . To assess whether PINK1-related autophagy is mediated by the Beclin1�Vps34 complex , we first evaluated GFP�LC3 vacuole-positive cells in presence of 3-methyladenine 3MA , a compound known to block autophagy by inhibiting the activity of class III PI3K�Vps34,33 a Beclin1 effector that regulates autophagosome formation and maturation.30 We showed that , in PINK1-expressing cells , increasing concen-trations of 3MA were able to significantly decrease basal and starvation-induced autophagy Figures 5g and h . To further verify the direct involvement of Beclin1 , we then knocked down Beclin1 by siRNA . Beclin1 silencing also induced a significant reduction of autophagy in cells overexpressing PINK1 , although the proportion of autophagic cells remained higher than that of control cells Figures 5i and j . To assess the effect of distinct mutations on PINK1-related autophagy , we next monitored the proportion of autophagic cells and endogenous LC3 conversion in SH-SY5Y cells expressing PINK1-FL and either the W437X or the G309D mutant . In immunofluorescence , the percentage of vacuole-positive cells was significantly lower in cells expressing PINK1W437X than those expressing PINK1-FL in nutrient-rich conditions , and overall comparable with untransfected controls under starvation Figures 6a and c . Conversely , overexpression of PINK1G309D resulted in an increase in the number of autophagic cells that did not significantly differ from PINK1-FL both under nutrient-rich and starvation conditions Figures 6b and d . Similar results were obtained with LC3 western blotting Figures 6e and f . Taken together , our data show that PINK1-FL is able to significantly enhance basal and starvation-induced autophagy , and that this effect is at least partly mediated by Beclin1 . The PINK1-mediated autophagy is greatly reduced in presence of PINK1W437X , ability of which to bind Beclin1 is largely impaired , but not in presence of PINK1G309D , a protein with defective kinase activity but unaltered Beclin1 binding . PINK1 overexpression does not affect mitochondrial morphology . We next sought to assess whether the observed effects of PINK1 on autophagy could be mediated by its activity on mitochondrial dynamics . Mitochondrial morphology was analyzed in HeLa cells by co-transfecting a mitochondrially targeted yellow fluorescent protein mtYFP with mitofusin1 and DRP1 as positive controls for the induction of fusion or fission , and with either PINK1-FL , PINK1W437X or PINK1G309D and performing live imaging using confocal microscopy . For quantitative analysis of mitochondrial morphology , we distinguished between cells with tubular , intermediate or fragmented mitochondria , as described previously.34 Co-transfection of mtYFP with each construct was confirmed by immunofluorescence analysis data not shown . Live imaging of cells overexpressing mitofusin1 showed a higher number of cells with tubular mitochondria than mock-transfected cells , whereas the expression of DRP1 resulted in a significant increase of fragmented mitochondria . Transfection of mtYFP with PINK1-FL or mutants did not result in visible morphological changes of the mitochondrial network in comparison with control cells Figure 7 , suggesting that , at least in this experimental setting , PINK1 is not directly involved in the regulation of mitochondrial dynamics . rich nutrient starvation SH-SY5Y PINK1-FL 3 1h starvation siBeclin1 60 1h mRNA 1 cells 50 Discussion In this study , we describe a new interaction between the pro-autophagic protein Beclin1 and PINK1 , a protein mutated in autosomal recessive PD . Beclin1 , also known as ATG6 , is a proautophagic protein that has been extensively studied as a tumor-suppressor factor and as an interactor of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2.29,35 Beclin1 expression decreases in an age-depen-dent manner in human brains , leading to a reduction of autophagy with aging , which possibly contributes to the progression of neurodegenerative diseases.36 A role of Beclin1 in neurodegeneration is also supported by the finding of reduced Beclin1 levels in affected brain regions of patients with Huntington�s and Alzheimer�s diseases moreover , Beclin1 deficiency in cellular and animal models of these disorders was shown to induce disruption of neuronal autophagy , accumulation of mutant hungtintin and amyloid-b and neuronal cell loss.36,37 Our data , to the best of our knowledge , correlate for the first time Beclin1 to a protein directly involved in PD pathogenesis , strengthening the link between autophagy and PD-related neurodegeneration . Beclin1 is strictly modulated by the binding of Bcl-2 family members Bcl-2 Bcl-XL , which results in autophagy inhibi-tion . On receiving autophagic stimuli , this interaction is disrupted either by post-translational modifications e.g . JNK-mediated Bcl-2 phosphorylation or by competitive binding with BH3-only proteins , such as Bad , allowing activation of autophagy.35,38 Very recently , Zalckvar et al.39 have shown that death-associated protein kinase DAPK -mediated phosphorylation of Beclin1 also promotes its dissociation from Bcl-XL and triggers autophagy . Using this knowledge , it might be speculated that PINK1 could modulate autophagy either through direct phosphorylation of Beclin1 or its inhibitory interactors , or through competitive binding . In our study , we were not able to detect PINK1-mediated phosphory-lation of Beclin1 in vitro . Moreover , kinase-defective PINK1G309D , but not the truncated mutant PINK1W437X , regulated autophagy with an efficiency similar to PINK1-FL , suggesting that this effect is mediated by Beclin1 binding and not by PINK1 kinase activity . The activation of autophagy by PINK1 was significantly reduced in the presence of Beclin1 silencing as well as exposure to 3MA , an autophagy blocker that inhibits Vps34,40 suggesting a direct involvement of PINK1 in the Beclin1�Vps34 macroautophagy pathway . However we noted that , under both conditions , PINK1-induced autophagy did not reach control cell levels , sugges-ting a possible role for PINK1 in distinct pathways . Indeed , recent studies have uncovered a number of Beclin1-depen-dent and -independent autophagy pathways , indicating that the macroautophagy process is far more complex than previously thought.30,41,42 Further studies are needed to establish how PINK1 can interplay with Beclin1 multiple interactors and with other major autophagy effectors to trigger the autophagic response in neuronal cells . In our study , PINK1 seems to positively regulate autophagy independently of its effects on mitochondrial dynamics . Indeed , in the presence of endogenous wild-type PINK1 , neither overexpression of PINK1 nor of its mutants had a directly influence on mitochondria morphology , whereas it clearly affected basal and starvation-induced autophagy . These findings are in line with those previously reported for Parkin , which also seems to activate mitophagy in a way independent from its activity on mitochondrial morphology.20 After PINK1 silencing , we observed a significant reduction of starvation-induced autophagy in SH-SY5Y cells , whereas no obvious differences were evident in nutrient-rich condition . The apparent discrepancy with a previous study , in which PINK1 silencing was reported to indirectly enhance mitophagy through the activation of mitochondrial fission , 19 could likely be explained by the different experimental settings adopted in the two studies , in particular the use of transient versus stable PINK1 silencing . In fact , it is plausible that a chronic reduction of PINK1 expression could activate compensatory pathways to counterbalance the damaging effects secondary to PINK1 deficiency , which are not yet appreciable at an early stage after silencing . Interestingly , we observed that endogenous Beclin1 only immunoprecipitated PINK1-FL and that the interaction between PINK1 and Beclin1 was markedly reduced in the absence of the first 112 aa of PINK1 . Taken together , these findings suggest that only PINK1-FL , and not the mature isoforms generated after mitochondrial import , is required to bind Beclin1 . Indeed , previous data have shown a tight regulation of the relative amounts and subcellular distribution of these isoforms , implying distinct roles within cells.11,12 Both PINK1-FL and Beclin1 are found in the mitochondria and cytosol , making it difficult to exactly locate the subcellular compartment in which the two proteins interact . As Beclin1 does not possess a canonical amino-terminal targeting signal rich nutrient starvation 1h 60 cells 50 vac 40 -LC3 30 20 GFP 2 LC3I 50- ? ? ? * 50-LC3II 1 PINK1 for mitochondrial import , it can be hypothesized that it may be partly associated with the outer mitochondrial membrane OMM in which the interaction with PINK1 could take place . Other Beclin1-interacting proteins , such as Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL , are known to partly localize at the OMM through their C-terminal hydrophobic domain , and a recently published protease protection experiment on isolated mitochondria demonstrated a PINK1 immunoreactivity pattern similar to Bcl-2 . This study suggested that the N-terminus of PINK1 would be inserted in the OMM through the putative transmem - rich nutrient starvation 1h 60 cells 50 vac 40 -LC3 30 GFP 20 LC3I 2 brane domain aa 94�110 , with the kinase domain facing the cytosol.13 Such a localization would argue against our hypothesis , as both N-and C-terminal domains of PINK1 are required to ensure a strong Beclin1 binding . Nevertheless , it is reasonable to speculate that a pool of PINK1-FL would not enter the OMM , but remain associated with mitochondria through anchoring proteins . In line with this hypothesis , Weihofen et al.12 have proposed that binding to Cdc37 Hsp90 would destine PINK1 to mitochondrial import and processing , while in the absence of Hsp90 , PINK1 would remain attached to mitochondria as a full-length precursor . More recently , the same authors reported a new interaction of PINK1 with Miro and Milton , two proteins that are part of a complex connecting mitochondria to microtubules . Only Miro spans the OMM with its C-terminus , and thereby can anchor the cytosolic protein Milton and other members of the complex , such as PINK1 , to the mitochondrion.27 Interest-ingly , overexpressions of Miro and Milton were shown to induce accumulation of PINK1-FL in the mitochondrial fraction , suggesting the existence of a regulatory mechanism controlling the pool of PINK1-FL , which is required to act at the mitochondrial outer membrane . In conclusion we show that , besides its many protective functions , PINK1 may also have a relevant role in promoting basal and starvation-induced autophagy . The identification of autophagy as a key protective mechanism against neuronal cell loss has represented a crucial step toward the develop-ment of new therapeutic strategies for neurodegeneration , 23 and autophagy-inducing drugs have been shown to bear neuroprotective activity in cellular and animal models of neurodegenerative diseases.24 Using this knowledge our findings represent a major progress in the current understanding of PD pathogenesis , and open new exciting research perspectives . Yeast-two-hybrid analysis . A GAL4-based yeast two-hybrid screening was performed as described previously.43 Three PINK1 baits N-terminus , aa 1�100 kinase domain and C-terminus , aa 110�581 full-length protein , aa 1�581 were cloned in pGBD-B vector kind gift of Prof. David Markie , University of Otago , New Zealand by gap repair , and used to screen a pre-transformed human brain cDNA library Human Brain BD Matchmaker , BD Biosciences , San Jose , CA . Potential interactions were checked for the activation of two reporter genes HIS3 and ADE2 by growth on selective medium . Specificity and reproducibility of interactions were further confirmed by re-cloning interacting preys in pACT2-B vector and mating them with the original bait strain and with an unrelated bait strain b2-microglobulin , aa 30�96 . For positive clones , interaction sequence tags were determined by sequencing the PCR fragments obtained from prey inserts and the corresponding genes were identified by bioinformatic search of nucleic acid databases . Eukaryotic expression vectors . The PINK1 constructs were all tagged at C-terminus with HA epitope . The constructs PINK1-FL , PINK1W437X and PINK1G309D have been described previously.28 The PINK11�496 and PINK1112�581 constructs were generated from PINK1-FL cDNA by introducing , respectively , an EcoRI restriction site at position 497 and a start codon at position 112 using the QuickChange II XL Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit Stratagene , La Jolla , CA , USA . The two fragments , 1�496 and 112�581 , were then subcloned in pcDNA 3.1 ? Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA , USA and HA-tagged at the C-terminus as described.28 The Beclin1 cDNA omitting the stop codon was amplified from human cDNA using primers 50-CCCAAG CTTGGGATGGAAGGGTCTAAGAC-30 sense HindIII tail and 50-GGAATTCTTT GTTATAAAATTGTGAGGACAC-30 antisense EcoRI tail and cloned into the HindIII and EcoRI sites of pcDNA3.1 ? .

The HeLa cells were either transfected with vectors expressing PINK1-FL or co-transfected with vectors expressing PINK1-FL or each PINK1 mutant and Beclin1 . Both HeLa cells and SH-SY5Y cells stably expressing PINK1-FL were lysed in 1 % Triton X-100 buffer 10 mM HEPES pH 7.5 , 142.5 mM KCl , 5 mM MgCl2 , 1 mM EDTA , containing protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktails Pierce , Rockford , IL , USA .

The immune complexes were then washed three times with lysis buffer without Triton X-100 by centrifugation . Samples were heated in SDS sample buffer and processed by western blotting . Immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy . Immuno - fluorescence analysis was performed as described previously28 using the following antibodies anti-HA Covance , Berkeley , CA , USA to detect PINK1 proteins , anti-Myc Novus Biologicals to detect Beclin1 , anti-Calnexin Sigma , anti-TOM20 BD Biosciences , anti-LAMP1 Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank , Iowa City , IA , USA , anti-Golgin Molecular Probes , Eugene , OR , USA .

For each co-localization showing an R value 40.30 , overlay masks are presented in Supplementary Figure 2c . FRET�FLIM assay . The FRET�FLIM measurements rely on the observation that fluorescence lifetime of a donor fluorophore is shorter in close proximity o10 nm of an acceptor fluorophore , in which the energy transfer only depends on the distance of the two protein-interacting domains and not on their relative concentration . The FRET�FLIM assays were performed as previously described . Briefly , fixed HeLa cells transiently transfected with PINK1 constructs and Beclin1 were labeled with appropriate primary and secondary antibodies see above . Samples were examined with a C1 confocal microscope attached to a TE2000 inverted microscope and equipped with a LIMO lifetime imaging system Nikon .

Mitochondrial and cytosolic subcellular fractions were isolated by cell disruption followed by differential centrifugation and washing as described previously , 4 with some modifications . Briefly , homogenates were centrifuged at 750 g for 10 min at 4 1C , and supernatants were then centrifuged at 10 000 g for 15 min at 4 1C . Pellets contained the enriched mitochondrial fraction , whereas supernatants contained the cytoplasmic microsomal fraction . Equal amounts of proteins from the two fractions were analyzed by western blotting .

Anti-TIM23 and anti-GAPDH antibodies were used as molecular markers of the two fractions . Analysis of GFP�LC3 immunofluorescence . The SH-SY5Y cells stably expressing GFP�LC3 were transfected with HA-tagged PINK1-FL , PINK1W437X or PINK1G309D , and immunostained with anti-HA antibody to mark PINK1-expressing cells . In each acquired field , GFP�LC3 cells not expressing PINK1 were used as controls . For PINK1 silencing , GFP�LC3 SH-SY5Y cells were either transfected with PINK1 or scramble shRNA expression plasmid . For Beclin1 silencing , GFP�LC3 SH-SY5Y cells were transfected with either HA-tagged PINK1-FL or pcDNA3.1 with or without Beclin1 or scramble siRNA . Autophagy was quantified by counting the percentage of cells exhibiting the accumulation of GFP�LC3 vacuoles GFP�LC3vac . Cells mostly presenting a diffuse distribution of GFP�LC3 were considered non-autophagic , whereas cells presenting several intense GFP�LC3 vacuoles were classified as autophagic.44 Experiments were performed in nutrient-rich condition and after starvation , in absence or presence of treatments . Optimal setting for starvation-induced autophagy was established in a 4-h time course experiment .

20075941	www.nature.com cdd Embryonic stem ES cells show two principal features self-renewal and pluripotency . Extrinsic growth factors , such as leukemia inhibitory factor LIF , are able to maintain cells in the pluripotent state through the control of master genes at the epigenetic and transcriptional levels.1�4 The expressions of Nanog , Oct4 and Sox2 have an important role in the maintenance of the pluripotent state.5 Nanog has a critical role in the regulation of cell fate of pluripotent inner cell mass ICM during embryonic development , maintaining the pluri-potent epiblast and preventing differentiation to primitive endoderm.3 High levels of Nanog maintain self-renewal and pluripotency in the absence of LIF.3 In addition , Nanog ES cells show slow differentiation to extra embryonic endoderm in vitro , 2 and Nanog repression leads ES cells to selectively differentiate into primitive endoderm.6 On the other hand , Nanog expression is repressed by p53 protein.7 During ES cell differentiation , the rapid downregulation of Nanog correlates with the induction of the transcription activity of p53 and p53Ser15 , p53Ser315 and p53Ser392 phosphorylation.7 Modification of p53 activity by knock-in of p53S315A results in inefficient Nanog suppression during ESC differentiation . In addition , under oxidative stress conditions , p53 acetylation in residues of lysine K371 and K379 are important to promote translocation of p53 into nucleus.8,9 Epigenetic modifications of chromatin also have a role in the control of ES cell differentiation . The abundance of transcrip-tionally active chromatin marks , such as histone H3 trimethy-lation on lysine 4 H3K4me3 and acetylation of histone H4 H4Ac , or repressive chromatin marks such as histone H3 trimethylation on lysine 9 H3K9me3 in ES cells , supports this notion.10 Recently , it has been shown that downregulation of histone demethylase Jmjd2c increases histone H3K9me3 associated with Nanog promoter . This action may facilitate the access of repressors to Nanog promoter during differentiation.11 Nitric oxide NO has a relevant role during egg activation at fertilization12 and it is also involved in developmental processes in the embryo.13,14 In vitro differentiation of ES cells to cardiomyocytes upon exposure to high concentrations of chemical NO donors has been reported.15�20 The activation of p53 mediates a number of actions of NO in cells , 21�23 but the involvement of p53 in the activation of differentiation in ES cells by NO remains to be determined.8,24 In this context , we describe in this study for the first time that short treatment with high concentrations of the chemical NO donor , diethylenetriamine nitric oxide adduct DETA-NO , leads to Nanog and Oct4 mRNA decrease and protein downregulation , upregulation of p53 expression and promo-tion of p53 post-translational modifications . NO treatment also modifies the patterns of methylation and acetylation of H3 and H4 histones . Moreover , we show that p53 phosphorylated on Ser 315 binds to Nanog promoter in the absence of LIF , favoring its repression . Exposure to NO donor for 19 h also induces differentiation events that are apparent by the presence of cells with epithelial morphology , and by the expression of early endoderm markers such as Pdx-1 . When these cells were exposed to the differentiation protocols for 10 days , cells with endoderm phenotype and expressing definitive endoderm markers , such as FoxA2 , Sox17 , Hnf1-b and GATA4 , were obtained . Results Nitric oxide induces Nanog and Oct4 down - regulation . When mES cells line D3 were exposed to DETA-NO , a dose-dependent downregulation of Nanog and Oct4 protein expression was apparent Figure 1a . In addition , the decrease in Nanog and Oct4 was time dependent on cells exposed to 1mM DETA-NO Figure 1b . This effect is linked to repression of Nanog and Oct4 genes as evidenced by measurement of mRNA levels with quantitative PCR Figure 1d . The repressive action of NO on these two genes was also apparent in other mESC cells lines , such as R1-E and AINV-15 , both at the protein and mRNA level Figures 1c and e , respectively and in the hES cell line HS-181 Figure 1f . Treatment of D3 mES cells expressing GFP driven by Oct4 promoter with 1mM DETA-NO causes a reduction in GFP-positive cells of 82.15 and 95.75 % in the presence and absence of LIF , respectively , and this effect is accompanied by changes in colony morphology Supplementary Figure 1 . p53 is upregulated by nitric oxide . Treatment of mES cells with DETA-NO induces a dose-dependent increase in p53 protein , and this action is more relevant in the absence of LIF Figure 2a . The level of p53 transcript is not altered by DETA-NO Figure 2b . In contrast , a prominent transactivation of p21 is observed , either in the presence or absence of LIF . The transcription of additional Nanog repressors , such as Tcf3 and mSin3a , was not affected by DETA-NO treatment in the presence of LIF Figure 2b . In the absence of LIF , Tcf3 tran-scription was increased and DETA-NO treatment decreased Tcf3 and did not modify mSin3A level of transcription Figure 2b . Nitric oxide induces p53 and H3 histone post-trans - lational modifications . Figure 3a shows that exposure of D3 cells to DETA-NO increases p53 protein expression and promotes p53 phosphorylation in Serine 15 and Serine 392 , both in the presence and absence of LIF , and acetylation in Lys 379 in the absence of LIF in a concentration-dependent manner . Trimethylation of H3 histone in lysine 9 and mono di and tri-methylation in lysine 4 is increased after DETA-NO treatment . On the other hand , DETA-NO produces a slight increase in monomethylation of histone 3 in lysine 4 , and acetylation of histones H3 and H4 Figure 3b . These actions are again more apparent in the absence of LIF . Moreover , a partial stabilization of p53 is obtained when cells are cultured in the presence of the proteasome inhibitor lactacystin Supplementary Figure 4 . Under this condition , phoshorylation of S15 , S315 and S392 is negligible in untreated cells . Exposure to DETA-NO leads to significant increases in S315 and S392 phosphorylations . Treatment with nitric oxide enhances p53 nuclear protein level and repression of Nanog promoter . Treatment with DETA-NO induces an increase of p53 protein in nucleus , both in the presence and absence of LIF Figure 4a , which is associated with Nanog downregulation . Nanog is located mainly in the nucleus and exposure to the NO donors leads to a substantial decrease in the amount of this protein in nucleus . Figure 4b shows that p53 phosphorylated in Ser 392 , Ser 315 and Ser 15 after exposure of D3 cells to DETA-NO is located only in nucleus . In contrast , exposure of D3 cells to the apoptosis inducer camptothecin leads to p53 gene expression , Ser 15 phosphorylation and translocation of the protein to mitochondria Figure 4c . Using ChIP assay , we document that H3 histone trimethy-lated in Lys 9 binds to proximal and distal Nanog promoter after DETA-NO treatment , and these interactions were observed both in the absence and presence of LIF Figure 4d . In addition , binding of p53 and p53 phosphory-lated in Ser 315 to p53 element of Nanog promoter was observed only when cells were cultured in the absence of LIF Figure 4e . p53 binding to Nanog promoter was confirmed with two different antibodies Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Santa Cruz , CA , USA , FL-393 and Calbiochem , San Diego , CA , USA , Ab-7 and nonspecific binding of p53 antibodies to p53-nonspecific sequences of Nanog exon 4 region of chromatin was not observed data not shown . Depletion of p53 cancels the effects of nitric oxide on Nanog repression , apoptosis and differentiation . Transfection of D3 mES cells with p53 shRNA leads to depletion of p53 protein signal Figure 5a , upper and partially cancels the repressive action of DETA-NO on Nanog expression Figure 5a , middle . Exposure to 1mM DETA-NO leads to induction of apoptosis in D3 mES cells , as detected by the loss of intact PARP and by caspase 3 cleavage Figure 5b . This action is not apparent in p53-interfered cells . On the other hand , DETA-NO treatment increases the expression of the differentiation markers , GATA6 and FoxA2 Figure 5c and the transactivation of p21 Figures 2b and 5c . Depletion of p53 significantly reduces the effect of NO on the expression of Gata 6 , FoxA2 and p21 genes Figure 5c . Nitric oxide treatment results in cell populations resistant to apoptosis and with endoderm phenotype . Treatment with 0.5mM DETA-NO for 19h induces apoptosis in 40 % of adherent cells , as determined by incorporation of Annexin V into cell surface , both in the absence and presence of LIF Figure 6A . Of the adherent population of cells , 60 % are Annexin V negative and manage to escape from DETA-NO-induced cell death . Colonies of apoptosis-resistant cells show different morphologies when compared with colonies of control cells data not shown and show areas expressing endoderm markers , such as Pdx 1 Figure 6D , a�c . Moreover , these adherent cells have enhanced expression of genes encoding for cytoprotective proteins , such as heme-oxigenase-1 Hmox1 and heat shock protein 70 Hsp70 Figure 6B . Adherent cells after DETA-NO treatment were subse-quently exposed to a newly designed protocol for endoderm differentiation Figure 6C . This protocol consists of four steps i precondition step , in which cells grow in the absence of LIF for 3 days ii selection step , in which cells are exposed to 0.5 mM DETA-NO for 19 h iii prematuration step , in which cells are cultured for 24 h in media containing 15 % FBS and 100 mM VPA and iv maturation step , in which cells are exposed from day 6 to day 10 to media containing 2 % FBS and 100 mM VPA. Maturation led to generation of a population of cells with definitive endoderm fate . Figure 6D shows different stages in the morphology of cells during the differentiation process . DETA-NO-treated D3 mES cells show endoderm morphology and express endoderm markers such as Gata 4 Figure 6E , condition c and Pdx1 Figure 6D , a�c similar results are observed in R1-E and AINV-15 mES cells Supplementary Figure 3 . Other endoderm markers , such as Fox A2 , Hnf1B and Sox 17 , do not change significantly Figure 6E , condition c . Figure 6E , conditions d�f , also shows expression of definitive endoderm markers obtained in steps iii and iv of the protocol described earlier . At the end of treatment , FoxA2 , Gata4 , Hnf1-b and Sox 17 increase 7.8-15.3-42.1-and 120-fold , respectively , when compared with control without treatment . After 8 days of treatment , all cells express FoxA2 marker Figure 6D , d�f . Markers of mesen-doderm Brachyury , mesoderm Nkx2.5 , ectoderm Zic 1 and trofectoderm Cdx2 were not detected at the end of treatment Figure 6F . Discussion We show in this report that high levels of NO rapidly induces repression of self-renewal genes and starts the differentiation process in the D3 line and in other mESC cells lines . In this context , previous reports have shown that exposure to high levels of chemical NO donors halts proliferation events and promotes differentiation of embryonic cells into cardio-myocytes , 15�20 but no evidence was provided on the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of pluripo-tency by NO at the gene transcription level . The regulation of Nanog and Oct4 levels is a key switch of ES cell fate.25,26 The presence of these transcription factors maintain self-renewal and pluripotency.26 During differentia-tion process Nanog and Oct4 levels decrease significantly.6,27 In this study we show that treatment with high levels of DETA-NO induce downregulation of Nanog and Oct4 . This effect is apparent after short periods of exposure 19 h and is rapid when compared with other systems , such as Nutlin 3 days 28 and Activin A plus Wnt 3 days , 29�31 a feature that makes it suitable for use in differentiation protocols . In mES cells , Nanog and Oct4 protein and mRNA down-regulation by NO is dose and time dependent , both in the presence and absence of LIF Figures 1a�e . Nanog and Oct4 mRNA was also downregulated by NO in hES cells cultured in the presence or absence of bFGF Figure 1f . The fact that NO decreases Nanog and Oct4 mRNA significantly Figures 1d�f suggest the existence of regulatory actions at the gene expression level Figures 1d�f . In this context , an increase in p53 suppressor of Nanog was observed Figures 2a and 3a . On the other hand , NO increases p53 stability and induces p53 activation through post-translational modifications , such as p53 phosphorylation in Ser15 , Ser392 , acetylation in Lys 379 Figure 3a and phosphorylation in Ser 315 Figure 4b . According to previous reports , these modifications have three consequences 1 phosphorylation in Ser 15 increases p53 stability and participates in the recruitment of factors that promote C-terminal acetylation.32 2 acetylation of Lys 379 in ES cells promotes p53 translocation into nucleus , 8 and 3 phosphorylation of Ser315 increases its transcriptional activity.33 Our results show that NO treatment enhances p53 protein stability Figures 2a and 3a , increases p53 acetylation Figure 3a , promotes p53 translocation into nucleus associated with its acetylation Figures 4a and b , increases transcriptional activity and induces p21 transactiva-tion Figure 2b . It is interesting to note that p53 activated by NO through phosphorylation in Ser 315 can directly bind to p53 element present in Nanog promoter Figure 4e . These results are in agreement with a previous report showing that knock-in of p53S315A results in inefficient Nanog suppression.7 In this study we show for the first time that phosphorylated p53S315 after exposure of cell to DETA-NO binds to Nanog promoter and represses Nanog gene Figure 4e . On the other hand , NO repression of Nanog is specifically dependent on p53 , as other repressors of Nanog , such as Tcf3 and mSim3a , are not upregulated Figure 2b . Moreover , p53 depletion with p53 shRNA cancels significantly the effect of NO on Nanog repression Figure 5a . It has been reported that p53 phosphorylation in Ser 15 and Ser 392 induced by oxidative stress is involved in p53-dependent apoptosis.8 Exposure to high levels of the chemical NO donor also triggers apoptotic events in these cells . In fact , 30�40 % of cells are Annexin V positive , which is a sign of apoptosis Figure 6A . Other apoptosis markers , such as PARP degradation and cleaved caspase-3 , are also apparent in these cells Figure 5a and Supplementary Figure 2 . These signs of apoptosis are accompanied by a rise in p53 protein levels Figure 2a and Supplementary Figure 2 . Nevertheless , a population of cells expressing citoprotective genes , such as heme-oxigenase-1 and Hsp70 Figure 6b , manage to resist the oxidative stress and likely enter the differentiation program . In cells that remain adherent after NO treatment , p53pSer15 , pSer315 , pSer392 is located in nucleus Figure 4b . On the other hand , treatment of cells with camptothecin , a genotoxic stress agent that promotes p53 translocation to mitochondria and nucleus , 34 leads to detec-tion of p53 in nucleus with a similar pattern of phosphorylation in Ser residues , but p53pSer15 is also present in mitochondrial fractions , in agreement with previous reports.8,34 It is entirely possible that oxidative stress triggered by NO induces a rise in p53 protein levels , perhaps through post-translational changes in the protein such as those reported in this study . Mitochondria have a prominent role in apoptosis triggered by NO and the presence of p53 in this organelle may contribute to regulate some of the steps involved in this pathway . Nuclear actions of p53 during apoptosis are also well known . The inhibition of p53 by specific shRNA caused inhibition of PARP degradation and caspase 3 cleavage . The fact that exposure of ES cells to apoptotic agents , such as staurosporine , triggers apoptotic events , such as PARP degradation , caspase 3 cleavage and p53 upregulation without affecting Nanog expression , supports the notion that Nanog down-regulation induced by high NO concentrations is independent of the apoptotic actions induced by this molecule . Interestingly , treatment with NO causes a significant increase in H3 K9 me3 Figure 3b , which is related with Nanog repression.11 There is also recruitment of histone H3K9 me3 in Nanog promoter after NO treatment Figure 4d . It is particularly relevant that depletion of histone demethylase Jmjd2c induces H3K9 me3 downregulation of Nanog and induction of endodermal markers such as Gata4 and Gata6.11 In this respect , we have observed specific binding of histone H3K9 me3 on Nanog promoter , and subsequent expression of endoderm markers , such as FoxA2 , Gata4 , Hnf1-b and Sox17 , when cells are stimulated to differentiate with NO Figure 6e . Moreover , NO increases acetylation of histones H3 and H4 Figure 3b . According to these results , NO changes the structure of chromatin in ES cells , and this phenomenon is related with the starting of differentiation programs10,11 and cell memory.35 On the other hand , treatment with NO allows us to evaluate the role of p53 in the differentiation process . In this context , NO increases the expression of differentiation genes , such as Gata 6 and FoxA2 , and depletion of p53 cancels significantly the effect of NO Figure 5c . These results emphasize the role of p53 in the differentiation process in ES cells in accordance with previous reports.28 According to the results reported in this study and in agreement with published data indicating that Nanog repres-sion is required for endoderm differentiation6 and that histone modifications are required for correct differentiation , 10,11 we have developed a protocol for stem cell differentiation into definitive endoderm . The protocol consists of a �precondition step� for 3 days in LIF-starved conditions , followed by a �selection step� by NO treatment for 19 h , a �pre-maturation step� with VPA in 15 % FBS for 24 h and �maturation step� with VPA in 2 % FBS for 5 days . In the second step , NO downregulates Nanog and eliminates cells not committed to differentiate . Selected adhered cells continue to differentiate with VPA , which is a selected factor used for endoderm differentiation and maturation , during pancreatic develop-ment.36 To confirm this fact , it has been shown that histone deacetylase inhibitors have an important role in mES cell differentiation.36�38 It is interesting to note that Brachyury was highly expressed in control cells without LIF condition , indicating that these cells were committed to differentiation to mesoderm and endoderm . The fact that Brachyury expression was cancelled and Pdx1 and Gata 4 increased by NO treatment indicates that NO favored differentiation to endoderm . At the end of this differentiation protocol , a population of cells differentiated to definitive endoderm and expressed high levels of FoxA2 , Gata4 , Hnf1-b and Sox 17 . On the other hand , it has been shown that NO signalling is implicated in cardiomyocyte differentiation.15�20 Exposure of ES cells to different NO donors , 15,19,20 or overexpression of inducible NOS15 in these cells , increases the number of beating cardiomyocytes . In these reports , expression of cardiac markers was already detected in embryoid bodies . Subsequent exposure of these structures to high NO increases the number of beating cardiomyocytes . The default program in embryoid bodies is to differentiate to multiple cellular derivatives , including cardiomyocytes , and NO in-creases differentiation events by suppressing undifferentiated signals in the cells . In our model , culturing ES cells in adherent conditions and withdrawal of LIF allows us to equally expose cells to NO and analyze the action of this agent on pluripotency markers that are still expressed . The scheme presented in Figure 7 summarizes the effect of high concentrations of NO in mES cells , as derived from the results reported in this study . NO triggers two major pathways i stress pathways that select cells resistant to stress through increase in antioxidant genes and promote death by apoptosis of cells that fail to express these genes ii differentiations pathways that promote cell differentiation through repression of self-renewal genes , such as Nanog , and increase in differentiation genes such as Gata4 and Pdx1 . Deciphering the complete set of transcription factors targeted by NO and regulating the expression of differentiation and antioxidant genes deserve further exploration . In summary , we have designed a novel approach for embryonic stem cell differentiation to definitive endoderm . High levels of NO induce a switch-off of two of the most important genes of pluripotency , Nanog and Oct4 , enhance transactivation activity of p53 , remodel chromatin and promote expression of early endoderm markers Pdx1 and Gata 4 . The addition of VPA leads to differentiation to definitive endoderm . This protocol might be instrumental for the generation of progenitors of endoderm-derived tissues such as liver or pancreas .

20075943	www.nature.com cdd Maintenance of shape and morphology is required for normal mitochondrial and cellular functions . Mitochondria frequently undergo fission and fusion processes that regulate their morphology , number and function.1,2 This remodeling is of great relevance in both cell life and death being a mitochon-drial network involved in all the main cell activities , including proliferation , differentiation and senescence , as well as cell death by apoptosis . In particular , although mitochondrial fusion processes seem to be associated with cell differentiation and senescence , 3 fission processes are mandatory during cell proliferation and , as recently stated , in apoptotic events . Although mitochondrial fusion serves to maintain a tubular mitochondrial network and optimal mitochondrial function , mitochondrial fission is required in dividing cells to ensure inheritance of mitochondria by daughter cells , but it is also important during differentiation in response to new energy demands.4 Mitochondrial fission and fusion depend on the balance among several fusion and fission proteins . These include mitofusin 1 and 2 Mfn1 , Mfn2 and OPA1 , which are large GTPases essential for fusion processes and localized in the mitochondria , associated with the outer Mfn1 and 2 or inner OPA1 membrane.5�7 On the fission side , other proteins are involved dynamin-related protein 1 , also known as dynamin-like protein 1 DLP1 , which appears to be recruited to mitochondria to mediate fission activities , 8,9 and the human homologue of mitochondrial fission protein pre-viously found in yeast , the human Fis1 protein hFis1 . It is an integral outer mitochondrial membrane protein that has an essential role in completing mitochondrial fission.10 The mitochondrial network facilitates transfer of the mitochondrial membrane potential from oxygen-rich to oxygen-poor cellular regions . Hence , unbalanced mitochondrial fission and fusion may result in breakdown of the mitochondrial network , loss of the mitochondrial DNA , respiratory defects and an increase of reactive oxygen species.11,12 A poor mitochondrial function is well recognized in aging and neurodegenerative diseases , likely having a role in their biology . As mentioned above , mitochondrial fission has recently been reported to occur during apoptosis , induced by a variety of unrelated stimuli , 13 and appears to be associated with progression of the apoptotic execution pathway.14 Two different pathways triggering apoptosis have been character-ized in detail an extrinsic pathway , involving cell-surface TNF-a-related family of receptors and cytoplasmic adapter molecules , and an intrinsic pathway , for which mitochondrion is governed by pro-and antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family members . The intrinsic pathway is initiated by the formation of the cytosolic apoptosome , composed by Apaf-1 , procaspase 9 and cytochrome c released from mitochondria.15,16 Several reports indicate that mitochondria undergo rapid and excessive fission evoked by several stimuli early in both extrinsic and intrinsic pathways.17 Furthermore , apoptotic mitochondrial fission appears to be independent of effector caspases . However , although there is evidence that mito-chondria undergo fission in apoptosis , the molecular path-ways mediating this process are still poorly understood . Lipid rafts , defined a detergent-insoluble glycosphingolipid-enriched microdomains GEMs , have been implicated in the induction of apoptosis since many years.18 Microdomains have been shown to be essential for receptor-mediated apoptosis and they are involved in the Fas receptor contact and cell-death-inducing potency . During apoptosis , the ac-tivation of death receptors CD95 Fas , TNF-a receptor may also induce an intracellular movement of lipid raft components , for example , of GD3 ganglioside , toward mitochondria.19�20 After CD95 Fas triggering , raft-like GD3 ganglioside-enriched domains can be detected in mitochondria , where they contribute to apoptogenic events.19�21 We showed GD3 and GM3 gangliosides in isolated mitochondria from lympho-blastoid CEM cells challenged with anti-CD95 Fas and the presence of a multimolecular signaling complex on the mitochondrial outer membrane . In these raft-like domains , some molecules , including GD3 , the voltage-dependent anion channel-1 and the fission protein hFis1 are enriched , whereas Bcl-2 family proteins , including truncated Bid and Bax , are recruited.20 Other groups have also suggested that proapop-totic members of the Bcl-2 family associate with mitochondrial fission sites and mitochondrial fission proteins during apop-tosis22 and that mitochondria remodeling in terms of structural modifications , that is , their curvature changes , as well as their fission process , could be under the influence of several molecules , including lipid microdomains.20 In this paper , we analyzed the possible association of fission proteins with mitochondrial raft-like domains and showed that the mitochondrial fission molecule DLP1 can be recruited to these domains following apoptogenic stimuli , suggesting that they could correspond to the sites of fission within these organelles . Results Morphological evidence of mitochondrial fission process following Fas ligation . The ultrastructural analysis of lymphoid cells undergoing apoptosis after Fas ligation clearly indicated the presence of mitochondrial fission activity in these cells Figure 1 . This was characterized by the evidence of budding regions in mitochondria23 together with small mitochondria , conceivably derived by a fission process Figures 1b and c , compare with control untreated cells in Figure 1a . Strikingly , although thin sections 70 nm such as those obtained for transmission electron microscopy TEM analysis by post-embedding technique can allow the maintenance of the subcellular morphology but can limit the availability of antigenic sites , IEM performed using antibody Ab against ganglioside GD3 clearly showed , at the mito-chondrial level , the presence of gold particles specifically localized in the fission regions Figure 1d . Gold labeling of DLP1 was as well detected in these regions Figure 1e . Association of mitochondria remodeling proteins with GD3 . To evaluate fission proteins distribution and their possible association with mitochondrial raft-like domains , we performed immunofluorescence labeling , followed by scanning confocal microscopy analysis , either in CEM cells not shown or in HeLa cells Figure 2 labeled with polyclonal Ab anti-hFis1 or anti-DLP1 together with antimitochondrion MoAbs Figure 2a or anti-GD3 MoAbs Figure 2b . The analysis of GD3�mitochondria association revealed that , in basal conditions , GD3 in green only partially colocalized with mitochondria in red , which are organized in a well-structured network Figure 2a , first row note the rare overlay , i.e. , the yellow areas . By contrast , after Fas triggering , colocalization areas , corresponding to the yellow fluorescence resulting from the overlay of green and red fluorescence , were significantly more evident . In HeLa cells treated with anti-Fas , a fragmentation of the mitochondrial network can also be noted Figure 2a , second row . The analysis of DLP1�mitochondria association revealed very few colocalization areas in untreated cells Figure 2a , third row . After cell stimulation through anti-CD95 Fas , the merged image of DLP1�mitochondria revealed a massive recruitment of DLP1 to the mitochondria Figure 2a , fourth row , yellow areas . The mitochondrial fragmentation appears evident in these micrographs . As concerns the analysis of hFis1�GD3 association , yellow areas resulting from the overlay of green and red fluorescence were detected , which corresponded to colocalization areas Figure 2b , first row . These areas were significantly more evident in anti-CD95 Fas-treated cells with respect to un-treated cells , indicating that CD95 Fas triggering induces the lateral reorganization of mitochondrial raft-like microdomains where hFis1 together with GD3 was detectable Figure 2b , second row . The analysis of DLP1�GD3 association revealed very few colocalization areas in untreated cells Figure 2b , third row . This finding suggests that DLP1 and GD3 are not associated in these cells , as expected . By contrast , after cell stimulation through anti-CD95 Fas , the merged image of anti-DLP1 and anti-GD3 staining revealed large colocalization areas Figure 2b , fourth row . Therefore , cell triggering through anti-CD95 Fas preferentially promotes translocation of DLP1 in selective microdomains in which GD3 is highly enriched . Distribution of mitochondria remodeling proteins in sucrose density gradient fractions . We analyzed the possible association of fission proteins in both Triton X-100-insoluble and -soluble fractions after CD95 Fas triggering . As shown in Figure 3a , the analysis of the distribution of hFis1 and OPA1 in fractions obtained by a 5�30 % linear sucrose gradient revealed that both proteins were highly enriched in fractions 4�6 , corresponding to raft microdomains . This enrichment became more evident after triggering through anti-CD95 Fas as well as after staurosporine treatment Figure 3b . As expected , in untreated cells , DLP1 Figure 3a was almost entirely soluble in Triton X-100 . Indeed , in nonstimulated cells , DLP1 was present in fractions 6�10 , but was almost completely absent in fractions 4�5 , which corresponded to lipid rafts under our experimental conditions . After triggering through CD95 Fas , DLP1 was detected in the detergent-insoluble fractions 4�5 , indicating that DLP1 was recruited to raft-like fractions on CD95 Fas ligation Figure 3a . On the contrary , the proapoptotic protein Bak was constitutively present in mitochondrial raft-like microdomains Figure 3a . As a control , we also analyzed the distribution of two marker proteins , one of which CD4 is highly enriched in the raft fractions 4�6 and the other TfR is mainly distributed in the Triton X-100-soluble fractions 9�11 Figure 3a . These results were also quantified by densitometric analysis Figure 3b . Similar results were also obtained analyzing the association of mitochondria remodeling proteins in both Triton X-100-insoluble and -soluble fractions before and after CD95 Fas triggering in HeLa cells , which represent a more suitable experimental model to study apoptosis-associated mito-chondrial fission phenomenon see Supplementary Figure 1a . Again , the enrichment of mitochondria remodeling proteins in the detergent-insoluble fractions became more evident after CD95 Fas ligation , as revealed by densitometric analysis see Supplementary Figure 1b . Effect of ganglioside depletion on the recruitment of fission proteins in the Triton X-100-insoluble fraction obtained from isolated mitochondria . To confirm that fission proteins were present in mitochondrial raft-like microdomains , we performed the same analysis in both Triton X-100-insoluble and -soluble fractions obtained from isolated mitochondria Figure 4 . Again , we found the presence of hFis1 and OPA1 in the detergent-insoluble fraction of both untreated and anti-CD95 Fas-treated cells as well as after staurosporine treatment . On the contrary , DLP1 was almost entirely present in Triton X-100-soluble fraction of untreated cells . Conversely , after CD95 Fas triggering , as well as after staurosporine treatment , DLP1 was present in the Triton X-100-insoluble fraction . Interestingly , fumonisin B1 , an inhibitor of ceramide synthase , as well as � -threo-1-phenyl-2-decanoylamino-3-morpholino-1-propanol hydrochloride [ D ] -PDMP , a competitive inhibitor of gluco-sylceramide synthetase , significantly prevented the enrich-ment of fission proteins in the Triton X-100-insoluble fraction . The purity of the mitochondrial preparation was assessed by western blot by checking the endolysosomal compartment antigen Rab-5 or Golgi marker 130 GM130 . Moreover , as a control of the specificity of mitochondrial fraction , the pre-sence of the mitochondrial protein ANT1 was investigated data not shown . As a control of the raft-like fraction , GD3 was found in the Triton X-100-insoluble fraction from isolated mitochondria . After fumonisin B1 treatment , GD3 was virtually undetectable in these fractions . Effect of fumonisin B1 treatment on ganglioside synthesis , fission proteins association and fission process . To verify whether OPA1 and DLP1 may interact with hFis1 , cell lysates , obtained from CD95 Fas-treated and -untreated cells , were immunoprecipitated with anti-hFis1 Ab , followed by protein G-acrylic beads . The results obtained , presented in Figure 5a , showed that in control unstimulated cells DLP1 was slightly associated with hFis1 . On the contrary , after triggering with CD95 Fas , a significant proportion of DLP1 became associated with hFis1 , suggesting that , after CD95 Fas stimulation , DLP1 may associate with hFis1 within lipid rafts . As expected , OPA1 was associated with hFis1 either in the presence or in the absence of CD95 Fas triggering . No bands were detected after CD95 Fas stimulation in control immunoprecipitation experiments with an IgG having irrelevant specificity . The immunoprecipitation was verified by western blot Figure 5a . To analyze the effect of ganglioside depletion on the association of fission proteins with hFis1 , we performed the same experiments in cells pretreated with fumonisin B1 , an inhibitor of ceramide synthase Figure 5b . The results showed that pretreatment with this compound completely prevented OPA1 and DLP1 association with hFis1 , further showing a role for ganglioside in fission proteins association . As a control , we observed that pretreatment with fumonisin B1 resulted in quite complete disappearance of the ganglioside GD3 Figure 5c . To go deep inside the effects of ganglioside depletion on the mitochondrial fission process , we analyzed , by flow cytometry , physical parameters of mitochondria isolated from untreated and fumonisin B1-treated cells , and from CD95 Fas-treated cells , in the presence or absence of pretreatment with fumonisin B1 Figure 6a . We observed that 1 h treatment with anti-CD95 Fas induced a significant reduction of the forward scatter , indicating a reduction in mitochondrial size middle dot plot , boxed area with respect to untreated cells left dot plot , boxed area . This size reduction could indicate that a mitochondrial fission process was occurring . Importantly , and according to the biochemical data described above , pretreatment with fumo-nisin B1 right dot plot , boxed area prevented CD95 Fas-induced reduction of mitochondrial dimension . Administration of fumonisin alone did not modify the physical parameters of mitochondria not shown . The confocal microscopy observa-tions after cell staining with MitoTracker-Green Figure 6b and Supplementary Figure 2 seem to confirm this hypothesis . In fact , the fragmentation of mitochondria , a typical fission-associated feature , was observed in CEM cells treated with anti-CD95 Fas for 1 h Figure 6b , central picture or 3 h not shown , but not in the cells treated with fumonisin B1 before CD95 Fas administration right picture , which appeared very similar to untreated control cells left picture . Morphometric analyses also highlight a time-dependent effect of anti-CD95 Fas in inducing mitochondrial fission Figure 6c . As expected , and according to data from the literature , 24 fumonisin B1 pre-treatment also resulted in a significant reduction more than 50 % of the anti-CD95 Fas-induced apoptosis Figure 6d . Fluorescence microscopy observations performed on HeLa cells stained with anti-mitochondria Figure 6e confirmed data obtained on CEM cells . In fact , fragmentation of the mitochondrial network was observed after Fas triggering central picture , compare with untreated cells in left picture but not in cells treated with fumonisin B1 before anti-Fas administration right picture . Effect of hFis1 silencing on DLP1 recruitment on mitochondrial lipid rafts . Moreover , to better verify the specificity of DLP1 recruitment through mitochondrial lipid rafts , we performed western blot analysis of mitochondrial Triton X-100-soluble and -insoluble fractions obtained from hFis siRNA-transfected cells after apoptosis triggering . In our experimental conditions , we found that 72 h after siRNA addition hFis1 siRNA or nonsilencing-siRNA i more than 95 % of HeLa cells were transfected Supplementary Figure 3a and ii in cells transfected with hFis1 siRNA , a significant reduction more than 80 % of hFis1 expression , with respect to nonsilencing siRNA-transfected HeLa cells , was detectable . These results were also confirmed by western blot analysis Supplementary Figure 3b , left panel followed by densitometric analysis Supplementary Figure 3b , right panel . The results of these experiments showed that the recruitment of DLP1 to mitochondrial raft-like microdomains was partially prevented in hFis siRNA-transfected cells Figure 7a . These results were also confirmed by confocal microscopy observations . In fact , in scrambled control cells , triggering through anti-CD95 Fas leads to the recruitment of DLP1 to mitochondria Figure 7b , see yellow areas in the merge picture , first row . This anti-Fas-induced relocalization of DLP1 was prevented , at least in part , in hFis1 knocked down HeLa cells see merge picture , second row . Importantly , as expected , the dramatic fragmentation of the mitochondrial network , induced by anti-Fas treatment in scrambled control cells third row , left panel , was completely hindered in hFis1-silenced cells third row , right panel . Discussion This work is focused at the comprehension of the possible implication of lipid microdomains in the process of mitochon-drial fission , thought to hinge on a series of protein molecules constitutively expressed on mitochondria or recruited to the organelle under proapoptotic stimulation . We show that these GEMs could participate in mitochondrial remodeling and fission , at least under receptor-triggered apoptosis . We found that mitochondrial raft-like domains can be detected in cells after CD95 Fas ligation , according to Garofalo et al.20 and , more importantly , we also found that molecules involved in mitochondrial fission processes are associated with these domains . In particular , although hFis1 appears to be constitutively included in mitochondrial raft-like domains , DLP1 is recruited to raft-like microdomains only on CD95 Fas triggering . Interestingly , the disruption of rafts , for example , by cyclodextrin , by fumonisin B1 an inhibitor of ceramide synthase also proposed for pharmacological use24 as well as by [ D ] -PDMP an inhibitor of glucosyltransferase , leads to an impairment of fission molecule recruitment to the mitochondria , a reduction of mitochondrial fission and a significant reduction of apoptosis . Altogether , these findings clearly suggest that receptor-mediated apoptosis , which is known to depend on a key downstream role of mitochondrial alterations , needs lipid raft integrity and function to proceed . As previously suggested by us and by other authors , lipid rafts could act as a sort of signaling device and or by a �chamber� catalyzing key critical reactions as those determin-ing cell fate.25�27 In fact , the function of rafts as catalytic sites at the plasma membrane was hypothesized since many years.18 They are necessary for CD95 Fas death signaling , that is , for receptor efficiency and death domain assembly . However , the role of lipid rafts in death execution seems to be not merely limited to the plasma membrane , as a role for microdomains has also been observed in the propagation of death stimuli . After the pioneering studies by the group of De Maria21,22 suggesting an intracellular trafficking of glycosphingolipids , we have shown that i the cytoplasmic trafficking of ganglioside GD3 , considered as a paradigmatic component of glycosphingolipid microdomains , could occur through its association with cytoskeletal components28 and ii mitochondrial fission-associated proteins are recruited to �raft-like� lipid microdomains under proapoptotic stimula-tion.20Hence , the data presented here seem to add a novel role for these lipid microdomains , which could contribute to mitochondria remodeling that precedes apoptosis execution . Figure 3 Lipid microdomain localization of mitochondria remodeling proteins in CEM cells . a Western blot analysis of sucrose gradient fractions . CEM cells , either untreated or treated with anti-CD95 Fas 250 ng ml for 1 h at 371C , and staurosporine , 1 mM for 2 h at 371C , were lysed and the supernatant fraction was subject to sucrose density gradient . After centrifugation , the gradient was fractioned and each gradient fraction was recovered and analyzed by western blot analysis . First line fractions obtained after sucrose density gradient , either untreated or treated with anti-CD95 Fas , and treated with STS , were analyzed using an anti-hFis1 polyclonal Ab . Second line fractions obtained after sucrose density gradient , either untreated or treated with anti-CD95 Fas , and treated with STS , were analyzed using an anti-OPA1 MoAb . Third line fractions obtained after sucrose density gradient , either untreated or treated with anti-CD95 Fas , and treated with STS , were analyzed using an anti-DLP1 MoAb . Fourth line fractions obtained after sucrose density gradient , either untreated or treated with anti-CD95 Fas , and treated with STS , were analyzed using an anti-Bak polyclonal Ab . Fifth line as a control , fractions obtained after sucrose density gradient from untreated cells were analyzed using an anti-CD4 MoAb or an anti-TfR MoAb . The fraction samples were loaded by volume . b Densitometric analysis of sucrose gradient fractions . The columns indicate the percent distribution across the gel of fractions 3�4 and 5 raft-fractions and 9�10 and 11 Triton X-100-soluble fractions , as detected by densitometric scanning analysis Figure 4 Association of mitochondria remodeling proteins with Triton X-100-insoluble fractions obtained from isolated mitochondria . Isolated mitochondria from CEM cells , either untreated or treated with anti-CD95 Fas 250 ng ml for 1 h at 371C , staurosporine 1 mM for 2 h at 371C , with or without preincubation with fumonisin B1 or [ D ] -PDMP , were detergent solubilized as reported in Materials and Methods . Both Triton X-100-soluble S and -insoluble I fractions were analyzed by western blot analysis and probed with anti-hFis1 polyclonal Ab , anti-OPA1 MoAb and anti-DLP1 MoAb . The fraction samples were loaded by volume . Alternatively , isolated mitochondria treated as above were subjected to ganglioside extraction . The extracts were run on HPTLC aluminum-backed silica gel and analyzed for the presence of GD3 , using an anti-GD3 MoAb GMR19 The process of mitochondrial fission has been recently analyzed in a number of works that essentially claim for i proteins that seem to have a role in the mitochondrial fusion e.g. , mitofusins , often associated with cell aging and ii proteins that are involved in the fission process e.g. , dynein GTPase DLP1 , hFis , associated either with cell proliferation , when daughter cells need their own energy factories , or with cell death by apoptosis , when fission process precedes the release of apoptogenic factors by mitochondria . For instance , it is well known that on apoptotic stimulation DLP1 is recruited to the mitochondrial outer membrane , where it colocalizes with Bax and Mfn2 at the fission sites.29,30 For example , DLP1 function is required for apoptotic mitochondrial fission and cytochrome c release.31 In addition , it has also been suggested that OPA1 , a profusion dynamin-related protein involved in cristae remodeling , could represent a further actor participating in mitochondrial changes during apoptosis.32�35 However , the submitochondrial localization of this protein appears still controversial . Indeed , a differential localization of different OPA1 isoforms has been observed . It has been suggested that the 88 kDa isoform preferentially associates with the outer membrane.36 In our experiments , we found that this isoform is present in raft-like microdomains and coimmunoprecipitates with hFis1 on apoptotic stimulation . At present , we can not rule out the possibility that further unidentified molecules could participate in the interaction between OPA1 and hFis1 proteins . Finally , as mitochondria fission includes a profound mitochondrial remodeling and changes of mitochondrial membrane curvature , it was suggested that changes of lipid and glycolipid moieties could at least participate , if not have a critical role , in the morphogenetic changes of mitochondria in cells undergoing apoptosis . On the basis of our experimental results , we can include lipid rafts in the complex molecular framework leading to mitochondrial fission their presence can provide catalytic domains where unknown molecular associations and or cleavages could occur , whereas their impairment also impairs fission and apoptosis . The role of the ganglioside in this multimolecular system could be to facilitate the transient and local formation of inverted hexagonal structures in mitochon-drial membrane that undergo the fission process , for example , modifying mitochondrial membrane curvature and fluidity . Figure 5 a Association of fission protein after different apoptotic signals . CEM cells , either untreated or treated with anti-CD95 Fas 250 ng ml for 1 h at 371C , with 1 mM staurosporine for 2 h at 371C or with TNF-a , 1 ng ml , for 2 h at 37 1C , were lysed in lysis buffer , followed by immunoprecipitation with rabbit anti-hFis1 . A rabbit IgG isotypic control was used . The immunoprecipitates were subjected to 7.5 % SDS�PAGE . Membranes were probed with anti-OPA1 MoAb and with anti-DLP1 MoAb . As a control , immunoprecipitates were assessed by immunoblot with anti-hFis1 MoAb . b Effect of fumonisin B1 on lipid microdomain localization of fission protein .

Fluorescence images were analyzed counting at least 200 cells for each experimental point . Only those cells in which DLP1�mitochondrial overlapping was observed were considered undergoing mitochondrial fission . Isolation and analysis of GEM fraction . GEM fraction from lymphoblastoid CEM cells and from HeLa cells , either untreated or treated with anti-CD95 Fas , was isolated as previously described.40 The optimal incubation time with anti-CD95 Fas 1 h at 371C was selected on the basis of preliminary experiments . Briefly , 2 108 cells were suspended in 1 ml of lysis buffer , containing 1 % Triton X-100 , 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5 , 150 mM NaCl , 5 mM EDTA , 1 mM NaVO4 and 75 U of aprotinin and allowed to stand for 20 min . The cell suspension was mechanically disrupted by Dounce homogenization 10 strokes . The lysate was centrifuged for 5 min at 1300 g to remove nuclei and large cellular debris . The supernatant fraction postnuclear fraction was subjected to sucrose density gradient centrifugation that is , the fraction was mixed with an equal volume of 85 % sucrose w v in lysis buffer 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5 , 150 mM NaCl , 5 mM EDTA . The resulting diluent was placed at the bottom of a linear sucrose gradient 5�30 % in the same buffer and centrifuged at 200 000 g for 16�18 h at 41C in an SW41 rotor Beckman Institute , Palo Alto , CA , USA . After centrifugation , the gradient was fractionated , and 11 fractions were collected starting from the top of the tube . All steps were carried out at 0�41C . The fraction samples were loaded by volume . Alternatively , mitochondria isolated from cells , either untreated or treated with anti-CD95 Fas , were detergent solubilized according to Skibbens et al.41 Briefly , mitochondria were lysed with 1 ml of extraction buffer 25 mM HEPES pH 7.5 , 0.15 NaCl , 1 % Triton X-100 and 100 kallikrein U ml aprotinin for 20 min on ice . Lysates were collected and centrifuged for 2 min in a Brinkmann microfuge at 12 000 r.p.m. at 41C . Supernatants containing Triton X-100 soluble material were collected pellets were undertaken to a second centrifugation 30 s to remove the remaining soluble material . The pellets were then solubilized in 100 ml buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.8 , 5 mM EDTA and 1 % SDS . DNA was sheared by passage through a 22-gauge needle . Both Triton X-100-soluble and -insoluble material were analyzed by western blot analysis , as previously reported.39 The fraction samples were loaded by volume . Immunoblotting analysis of GEM fraction . All the fractions obtained as reported above were subjected to SDS�polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis SDS�PAGE . The proteins were electrophoretically transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes Biorad Laboratory GmbH , Munchen , Germany . Membranes were blocked with 5 % defatted dried milk in TBS , containing 0.05 % Tween 20 and probed with anti-hFis1 polyclonal Ab Alexis Biochemicals , anti-OPA1 MoAb BD Biosciences Pharmingen , anti-DLP1 MoAb BD Biosciences Pharmingen , anti-Bak polyclonal Ab Santa Cruz Biotechnology , anti-TfR MoAb Abcam , Cambridge , UK or anti-CD4 MoAb Santa Cruz Biotechnology . Bound antibodies were visualized with HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG or anti-mouse IgG Sigma and immunoreactivity assessed by chemiluminescence reaction , using the ECL Western blocking detection system Amersham Biosciences , Buckinghamshire , UK . Densitometric scanning analysis was performed by Mac OS 9.0 Apple Computer International , Cupertino , CA , USA using NIH Image 1.62 software . The density of each band in the same gel was analyzed , values were totaled and then the percent distribution across the gel was detected . Analysis of hFis1 immunoprecipitates . CEM cells , untreated or treated with anti-CD95 Fas 250 ng ml for 1 h at 371C , were lysed in lysis buffer 10 nM Tris-HCL pH 8.0 , 150 mM NaCl , 1 % Nonidet P-40 , 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride PMSF , 10 mg ml leupeptin . Cell-free lysates were mixed with protein G-acrylic beads and stirred by a rotary shaker for 2 h at 41C to preclear nonspecific binding . After centrifugation 500 g for 1 min , the supernatant was immunoprecipitated with anti-hFis1 polyclonal Ab Alexis Biochemicals , plus protein G-acrylic beads . A rabbit IgG isotypic control Sigma was used . The immunoprecipitates were split into two aliquots . The first one was checked by western blot analysis , using anti-DLP1 MoAb BD Biosciences Pharmingen or anti-OPA1 MoAb BD Biosciences Pharmingen . The second one was subjected to ganglioside extraction , according to the method of Svennerholm and Fredman42 as reported below . Ganglioside analysis in the immunoprecipitates of the hFis1 . Briefly , samples were extracted twice in chloroform methanol water 4 8 3 v v v and subjected to Folch partition by the addition of water resulting in a final chloroform methanol water ratio of 1 2 1.4 . The upper phase , containing polar glycosphingolipids , was purified of salts and low molecular weight contaminants using Bond elut C18 columns Superchrom , Milan , Italy , according to the method of Williams and McCluer.43 The eluted glycosphingolipids were dried down and separated by HPTLC , using aluminum-backed silica gel 60 20 20 plates Merck , Darmstadt , Germany . Chromatography was performed in chloroform methanol aqueous KCl 0.25 % 5 4 1 v v v . The dried chromatograms were soaked for 90 s in a 0.5 % w v solution of poly iso bytyl methacrylate beads Polysciences , Wirrington , PA , USA dissolved in hexane . The plates were immunostained for 1 h at room temperature with GMR19 anti-GD3 MoAb Seikagaku and then with HRP-conjugated anti-mouse IgM Sigma . Immunoreactivity was assessed by chemiluminescence reaction , using the ECL Western detection system Amersham Biosciences . Preparation of isolated mitochondria . Control and treated cells were resuspended in Homo buffer 10 mM HEPES pH 7.4 , 1 mM ethylene glycol-bis -aminoethyl ether N , N 0 , N 00-tetraacetic acid , 0.1 M sucrose , 5 % BSA , 1 mM PMSF and complete protease inhibitor cocktail Roche , Indianapolis , IN , USA for 10 min on ice . Cells were homogenized with a Teflon homogenizer with B-type pestle44 for 10 min at 41C to remove intact cells and nuclei . The supernatants were further centrifuged at 10 000 g at 41C for 10 min to precipitate the heavy membrane fractions enriched in mitochondria . These fractions were then purified by standard differential centrifugation . The purity of our mitochondrial preparation was then tested by staining with MoAb specific to the endolysosomal compartment or Golgi vesicle antigens , Rab-5 and GM130 , respectively both from Santa Cruz Biotechnology . Results showed that the isolated mitochondria were almost completely negative either for the endolysosomal compartment antigen Rab-5 or for GM130 , a protein that characterizes Golgi apparatus , whereas they were strongly positive for the mitochondrial protein ANT1 data not shown .

20094060	Review www.nature.com cdd C Berry1 , C La Vecchia2,3 and P Nicotera* , 4 Parkinsonism is a complex syndrome resulting from a number of different pathogeneses that give rise to various degrees of motor deficits , akinesia , rigidity , tremors and postural dis-turbance along with other neurological deficits , which manifest as the disease progresses . These are generally considered to be manifestations of toxicity in dopaminergic neurons as main target . Post-mortem analysis of the brains of Parkinson�s disease PD patients has revealed the constant pathological finding that dopaminergic cell degeneration is most severe in the substantia nigra , pars compacta in which a consistent loss of 460�70 % of neurons is evident . Neuronal loss is less pronounced in other mid-brain regions . The mechanisms that make different neuronal subsets either resistant or more susceptible to parkinsonian degeneration are unknown as are the mechanisms responsible for neuronal injury and loss . It is generally agreed that the aetiology of PD is likely to involve both environmental and genetic factors.1,2 In recent years , several genes that participate in PD pathogenesis have been characterized . Alpha-synuclein and parkin are involved in familial PD , autosomal dominant and recessive PD , respec-tively . Their functions and that of other genes , including Omi HtrA2 , PINK-1 , DJ-1 and dardarin , has been the subject of intense studies and nested gene pathways are starting to be unveiled . Nevertheless , there is widespread concern that epigenetic factors and in particular environmental chemicals can either cause PD or increase the risk of developing it . A number of toxins may produce parkinsonism . Exposure to 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine MPTP has been shown to produce permanent parkinsonism in humans , non-human primates and rodents , by exerting an effect primarily on the function of mitochondrial complex I . Other known chemical triggers of parkinsonian syndromes include chronic exposure to high levels of manganese , which causes degeneration in the sub-thalamic nucleus and the pallidum and which improves after manganese chelation . Carbon disulphide CS2 can also cause neurobehavioural problems associated with a parkin-sonian syndrome in relatively young subjects . However , both manganese and CS2 also cause other neurological problems and can hardly be considered specific dopaminergic toxins . The pesticide dieldrin has been found in post-mortem brain samples from individuals with PD and can exacerbate MPTP neurotoxicity in mice after perinatal exposure . Paraquat PQ , a widely used pesticide , undergoes one-electron reduction chemistry in cells that can sequester it , causing a widespread oxidative nitrosative stress . In humans , ingestion of PQ accidentally or for suicidal purposes causes severe pulmonary lesions , which are often fatal . To date , there is no evidence that acute exposure to PQ causes brain lesions directly . On the other hand , PQ can induce PD-like lesions in certain mouse strains and rats . The underlying mechanisms are directly or indirectly related to reactive oxygen species . Because PQ is used widely in agriculture , concern has been raised that exposure to this agent may increase the risk of developing PD in the human population . In the following sections we will analyse the available epidemiological evidence as well as the leading hypothesis on the mechanism by which PQ can affect neurons . Epidemiological Studies General considerations . Data relating to the possible association between pesticides , herbicides and PD are derived from case reports , ecological studies e.g. , analysing exposure through water levels of pesticides , mortality studies analysing death certification in a defined area , case�control and cohort studies � with the last two being of greater value if inferences about aetiology are to be drawn . In any epidemiological study in this area it is important to consider potential bias and confounding factors . For case� control studies both case ascertainment and control selection are possible sources of bias . Cases may be identified from hospitals or clinics , residential care homes or prescribing records for drugs of relevance . Hospital cases may be more severe with the inference that less severe cases may be excluded . Controls may be population or hospital based , may include spouses of cases , subjects suggested by index cases and from families and friends . Friend and family controls may have similar exposures through a shared background . Recall bias is another major issue , particularly for neurodegenerative diseases . For cohort studies , definition of PD diagnosis , exposure ascertainment and the choice of the non-exposed comparison groups are key factors . Diagnostic criteria are another potentially important source of bias , as reviewed by Litvan et al.3 Potential confounding factors include age , well-water consumption , farming , rural living , head trauma , a family history of PD , smoking and caffeine intake , and infectious diseases such as Nocardiosis , as all of these have been suggested to affect the incidence of PD . Most studies have the major problem that there is no satisfactory information about definition , duration and extent of exposure . In addition , there is often no information about the specific types of pesticide used , or about those formula-tions available on the relevant market at the time when exposure took place . This also makes pooling of studies problematic . Pesticides and PD . More than 40 epidemiological studies , published during the past three decades , provide data on the issue of pesticide exposure and the risk of PD . It seems that many of these studies were instigated after the suggestions made by Barbaeu 1984 4 who , in a review paper that outlined a research strategy for PD , discussed the pathogenesis of parkinsonism induced by manganese intoxication and intoxication with MPTP . He wrote �although it is unlikely , except in drug addicts and chemists directly exposed , that Parkinson�s disease is generally caused by MPTP , it is certainly possible that many people are constantly being exposed to products with a similar conformation found frequently in nature or industrially . Many herbicides , for example , including the well-known Paraquat , may have a similar chemical mode of action . In susceptible individuals such products could initiate the process of cell degeneration found in Parkinson�s disease . This field deserves thorough scrutiny� . These epidemiological studies have been reviewed recently.5,6 Overall , about two-thirds of the studies gave relative risks RR above unity and one-third around or below unity , in the presence of a substantial heterogeneity . Engel et al.7 considered exposures of 310 orchardists who reported parkinsonism and who had previously participated in a study of men occupationally exposed to pesticides . Structured neurological examination was undertaken , and the subjects filled in a questionnaire about their pesticide exposures . The mean age was 69.6 years 238 were exposed to pesticides , and 72 were not . A nurse administered the united Parkinson�s disease rating scale UPDRS . No distinc-tion was made between PD and parkinsonian-like illnesses . The conclusion was that parkinsonism might be associated with long-term use of pesticides , but not with any particular compound . In a French cohort of elderly farmers , 8 the RR for exposure to pesticides was 5.6 95 % CI 1.5�21.6 in men based on eight exposed cases , but no association was observed in women RR ? 1.0 , 95 % CI 0.2�4.8 . In a case�control study from Olmsted Country , Minnesota , 9 based on 149 cases and 123 controls , the RR for any exposure to pesticides was 2.4 95 % CI 1.1�5.4 . The American Cancer Society Cancer Prevention Study II ACS-CSS II 10 was a large 143 325 cohort study of lifestyle and cancer starting in 1992 . This population was followed on a number of occasions , and in 2001 a question was asked about lifetime occurrence of PD . Participants were mostly white and the median age at enrolment was 63.7 years for men and 62 years for women . Occupational records were the source of exposure data and anyone recorded as �farmers , ranchers or a fisherman� was considered to be a farmer . There were 840 responders who reported a diagnosis of PD . Questioning on exposure included asking about asbestos , gasoline , dyes , formaldehyde and wood dust . Only 15 % reported pesticide exposure in the �farming� group and a similar figure was reported for gasoline exhaust . Exposure to pesticides was reported by 5.7 % of the total study population , and the corresponding RR was 1.7 95 % CI 1.2�2.5 for non-farmers and 1.6 95 % CI 0.9�2.7 for farmers . No specific pesticide was identified as a risk factor . A multicentre study from five European countries11 found only a modest overall association between working in agriculture and PD RR 1.13 , 95 % CI 0.83�1.57 . Such an association may well be explained by bias . A case�control study of occupational factors in PD conducted in nine German clinics and including 390 cases and a total of 755 population controls12 found RRs around 2 for professional herbicide or insecticide users , but only in one case was there a reported exposure to PQ . The issue of a possible association between PQ and PD received more attention after a study conducted in Taiwan between 1993 and 1995 on 120 patients with PD and 240 hospital controls was reported.13 Overall , 46 cases and 41 controls reported use of herbicides pesticides , corresponding to a RR of 2.89 95 % CI 2.28�3.36 . The RR rose to 6.72 95 % CI 2.62�17.21 for use for Z20 years . In all , 31 cases versus 21 controls reported paraquat use , corresponding to an RR of 3.22 95 % CI 2.41�4.31 , which rose to 6.43 95 % CI 2.41� 17.2 for use for Z20 years . Information on use of herbicides and pesticides was self-reported , and not validated . Allow-ance for tobacco use and other possible confounding factors did not explain the association observed . The use of both PQ and other herbicides and pesticides conferred an apparently greater risk than the use of herbicides other than PQ . The researchers did not however compare exposure to PQ alone versus other herbicides and against non-exposure . In a study from urban and rural areas of Finland , including 123 cases of PD and 246 controls , 14 3 cases versus 5 controls reported ever PQ use , corresponding to a crude RR of 1.2 , non-significant . The RR for overall use of herbicides was 1.4 95 % CI 0.8�2.5 , and that of pesticides was 1.0 95 % 0.6� 1.7 . Thus , in that study also , the RR estimate for PQ was not different from those of total herbicide and or pesticide use . A study from Washington State considered the proportional prevalence ratio as a measure of RR of parkinsonism rather than the full clinical picture of PD according to exposure to selected herbicides.7 The RR for any exposure to pesticides was 0.8 95 % CI 0.5�1.2 and that for exposure to PQ was also 0.8 95 % CI 0.5�1.3 . In a case�control study from the Group Health Cooperative in Washington State , 15 including 156 cases of PD with information on occupational exposure , 19 cases versus 28 controls reported any exposure to pesticides , corresponding to a RR of 1.0 95 % CI 0.5�1.9 . Only two cases and two controls reported any PQ use RR ? 1.7 , 95 % CI 0.2�12.8 . The Agricultural Health Study16 made a cohort investigation of over 79 500 agricultural workers from North Carolina and Iowa . The participants were recruited between 1993 and 1997 and followed-up to 1999�2003 . There were a total of 83 prevalent and 78 incident cases of PD . The researchers considered various exposures , including acute poisoning episodes and chronic exposures and took account of several confounding factors and the different farming practices of Iowa and North Carolina . They found that the prevalence of neurological symptoms was associated with cumulative life-time exposure to pesticides , notably organophosphates and organochlorines , and that this prevalence was mainly associated with chronic moderate exposure . Overall , 14 prevalent and 11 incident cases reported PQ use . The RRs , adjusted for all available confounding factors , were 1.8 95 % CI 1.0�3.4 for prevalent PD , and 1.0 95 % CI 0.5�1.9 for incident PD . These estimates were not heterogeneous when compared with those given for several other herbicides and pesticides . In fact , the overall RR of incident PD for the highest exposure level of all pesticides was 2.3 95 % CI 1.2�4.5 . PQ-specific studies . Until recently at least seven studies have reported data on PQ use and PD . Of these , five are case�control studies , one is a cross-sectional study7 and one is a cohort investigation.16 However , the total number of PD cases reporting exposure to PQ is only 95 . Few data on exposure to paraquat are available from studies published in the 1990s from Canada and Germany . In particular , Hertzman et al.17 published two reports , in 1990 and 1994 . The 1990 study was based on a case�control sample identified in the Kootenay region , a rural mountainous area of British Colombia with a reportedly high PD prevalence . Cases were identified by contacting physicians in the area who could identify patients with a diagnosis of PD who might respond to a postal questionnaire . The same neurologist subsequently examined all cases . Controls were randomly selected from regional electoral rolls and were of similar age and sex . Out of 57 cases of PD and 122 controls , 4 cases versus none in the control group reported ever handling PQ . The study had limited power due to the small sample size , and lacked details on risk factor exposure assessment . The 1994 study18 included 127 cases and comparable numbers of controls 1 randomly selected from electoral lists , and 2 cardiac disease patients in a rural area of British Colombia . Both quantity and frequency of exposure were assessed for a number of herbicides pesticides . Chemicals were evaluated both singly and by categories and the analyses were run separately for men and women . No significant association between PQ and PD was consistently found across control groups or genders . The RR estimates were approximately 1.1�1.2 according to the type of comparison group hospital community , and far from statistical significance . The study from Taiwan , 13 based on 120 PD cases and 31 cases exposed to PQ , reported a significant excess risk for PQ , which nevertheless did not differ from that for overall herbicide or pesticide exposure . All the other studies reported nonsignificant RRs , close to unity or slightly above unity . Thus , the apparent association between herbicides and PQ and PD in the study from Taiwan is likely to be due to some characteristics of the population or exposure , or due to some unrecognized bias or confounding . More importantly , there is no evidence that the relation between exposure to PQ and PD is different from that of other herbicides or pesticides , or � in the more general framework � occupation in agriculture as an indicator of PD risk . With reference to review papers , Brown et al.6 identified 38 case�control studies including three abstracts that were included as they had been peer reviewed . In its conclusions , although commenting on the lack of power in most studies , the paper relied heavily on animal data to provide support for its view that there was evidence of an association of PD with herbicides and insecticides . This conclusion was reached despite the fact that the animal studies discussed were made at dose levels that had little to do with human exposure and were not by �routes of administration that would be experi-enced by pesticide users� . Li et al. , 5 in another review paper , concentrated on studies with good definition of PD , with some attempt at exposure assessment . They were critical of case studies . When 32 studies had been selected , they were �scored� by an elaborate process with seven major criteria . With regard to PQ , the researchers considered that the studies of Liou19 were �provocative� , but pointed out that they have not been replicated . They considered that all of the studies had methodological flaws and concluded that there is no specific association of PD with herbicides , pesticides or any specific pesticide . More recent studies have produced surprising associations . These have been ignored for reasons that are not always clear and that may be due to a failure to document other relevant exposures . Others , in attempts to overcome the problems of generalizations about exposure , have analysed evidence of selectively sensitive populations or particular exposures . Both approaches have difficulties . A study by Tanner et al.20 was constructed without overly restrictive diagnostic criteria as the researchers considered that this might exclude toxicant-induced cases . Thus , subjects with typical or atypical parkinsonism were included . The study was conducted in the United States between 2004 and 2007 with 519 PD cases and 511 paired controls . Of these , over 90 % were assessed as having no exposure to pesticides . After adjustment for confounding factors , the data showed three significant occupational associations with parkinsonism Legal Occupa-tions a threefold increased risk � although this is noted as consistent with three previous studies , it is dismissed as spurious , pesticide use a twofold increased risk and Construction and Extraction work a 1.5-fold increased risk . Unlike the seven earlier studies quoted , this research was unable to detect an association between agricultural work and PD . Even the working in business and finance , legal occupations , construction and extraction , or transportation and material moving was associated with postural instability and gait difficulty subtype of parkinsonism . The study acknowledges that there were no quantitative assessments of chemical exposure that �recall bias� may affect the answers . They make the important point that in these case�control studies , causal relationships can not be assumed . Attention is focussed on the associations between PD and an apparent occupational exposure to 2,4-D and the statistically nonsignificant associations between paraquat , permethrin and PD . These three chemicals have very small groups of �exposed� cases , 16 , 9 and 7 , respectively and even smaller matched control groups 7 , 4 and 2 , respec-tively . Because exposure to more than one of these pesticides was common , the researchers considered that future investigations should also assess the effects of combined exposure . They commented �We found no associa-tion between the SOC code for agricultural work and parkinsonism , which confirms the suggestion that occupa-tional code is a poor surrogate for pesticide use� . It is perhaps surprising that it is so often used in this way . In another recent study , Costello et al.21,22 used a new approach for the assessment of pesticide exposure , incorpor-ating California Pesticide Use Reporting PUR data and the geo-coding of residential addresses . The study considered only the use of the pesticides paraquat and maneb informa-tion on exposure to other agricultural chemicals was not sought . Four time and age intervals were used in design and interpretation . They were firstly , an �exposure period� of 1974� 1999 , for which PUR information was available . The informa-tion , available for each year , has been aggregated into two time �windows� , 1974�1989 and 1990�1999 , but information has also been presented for the entire period . There was then a �diagnosis period� from January 1998 to January 2007 and an �enrolment period� from 1998 to 2007 . This seems to be the interval during which subjects were invited into the study and suggests that about one-half of the cases , but none of the controls , may have had previous contact with the researchers . It is interesting to note that results are provided for ages 35�60 and 460 years . Recruitment was helped by the cooperation of local neurologists , medical facilities , newspapers and radio stations . A total of 1167 cases were �invited� to participate but of these only 563 were �eligible� . In that , 96 eligible cases were excluded �because they had other causes of Parkinsonism� . Of the 563 eligible cases , 65 % 368 provided all information needed for analyses . The reasons why the investigators excluded 395 cases , as their �diagnosis date fell outside the 3-year range prior to contact� , were not discussed . It is worth noting that if these cases were appropriately included in the study base they should belong to the denominator this gives a participation rate of cases of 368 1165 51 ? 134 ? 37 % . It remains vague how controls were selected . About 45 % of �eligible� controls were included in the analyses but the response rate for all households approached is not provided it seems to have been low . Notably , controls , but not cases , were selected from among property owners . The cases had a slightly higher percentage of males than did controls , had more first-degree relatives with PD , were substantially less educated but , nonetheless , smoked substantially less . The gradient with education was about twofold and as strong as that for cigarette smoking . More cases than controls had occupational exposures to pesticides and both the residential and occupational exposures probably included agents in addition to PQ and maneb . The exposure information gathered for this study is very detailed . The pounds-per-acre of pesticide , applied within 500 m of each subject�s residence annually for 1974�1999 , was estimated . However , these data do not appear in the paper . Rather , each subject has been counted only as exposed or unexposed in either or both of the two 10-to 16-year time windows . It would seem that the available database would have allowed the researchers of this paper to describe each subject in terms of the number of years , and the specific years , of his her exposure to each pesticide . This , in turn , would have allowed an assessment of dose-response and , possibly , even of induction periods . Such analyses may have been of considerable value in evaluating causality , especially for the younger subjects . Neither of these two variables is addressed in the paper . Separate analyses are presented for two time windows of exposure , 1974�1989 and 1990�1999 and for the entire period 1974�1999 . The statement from the abstract regarding an odds ratio OR of 2.27 for �either maneb or paraquat alone� , relates to persons aged r60 at diagnosis in the first , 1974�1989 , time window . It seems in Table 3 of that study as pertaining to �paraquat or maneb only� presumably when compared with exposure to neither or to both . However , Table 2 of that study indicates that for both age groups in the entire 1974�1999 time window the OR for �paraquat only� was 1.01 whereas that for �maneb only� was 3.04 . Data on paraquat alone are not provided for either of the two component time windows or for either specific age group . Therefore , the OR of 2.27 almost certainly reflects a putative association of PD with maneb , as that pesticide in Table 2 of that study has an OR of 3.04 . The analyses for both exposure time windows and overall suggest that among subjects X60 years , the OR ranges from 4.17 to 5.74 for the exposure of �both paraquat and maneb� . This is the basis for the interpretation in the abstract that the two pesticides together increase the risk of PD among younger people . It implies an interaction between maneb and paraquat in the causation of PD � surprising in view of the fact that paraquat alone seems to have virtually no association with PD . In Table 2 of that study , the OR for paraquat exposure only is 1.01 , for maneb only is 3.04 , but for �both� it is 1.75 , which is not suggestive of any interaction between the two . Nevertheless , the findings in Table 3 of that study subjects aged X60 years suggest that paraquat and maneb do interact . It is not clear why the results of this study are so different for the two age groups discussed no doubt the younger patients were exposed at younger ages from Table 1 it is possible to estimate their average year of birth as 1951 as they were only about 12 years old when paraquat was introduced . Even so , many of them were likely exposed only , or mainly , when older . In comparison , the average year of birth of the older cases was about 1931 , and hence they were exposed to paraquat only at ages X30 years . It is reasonable to consider that the only meaningful difference in age at exposure is likely to be that some young cases , but not older cases , were exposed while in their 20s and fascinating to consider that an analysis of dose-response and induction latent period might be developed that might support or refute a causal relationship . Alternatively , it must be possible that the different procedures used for selecting younger and older controls produced the age-specific findings that are reported . Ritz and her colleagues , 22 in a case�control study of 324 incident cases of PD and 334 population controls in rural California , have reported that dopamine transporter DAT A clade diplotype and 30VNTR 9 9 carriers are at increased risk for PD . The researchers further report that genetic suscept-ibility conferred by DAT A clade diplotype and 30VNTR 9 9 interacts with joint exposure to paraquat and maneb to increase the risk for Parkinson�s disease significantly . They used a �population-based approach� although the nature of this is not clear . Certain cases were excluded because they were contacted more than 3 years after diagnosis and because they had �other causes� of PD . The county-by-county distribution reported is different for cases and controls see Table 1 in that study . Residence in Fresno County is strongly associated with PD , and these factors combined with the extremely low response rate may indicate that the case series and the controls are not representative of a defined population and may not be comparable . The response rates were variable . For cases , the rate may be anywhere between 35 and 62 % , depending on which �exclusions� are considered to be realistic . Exposure was determined in an unusual way , as it seems that �high exposure� means exposure to �paraquat and maneb� , but it is not clear whether the so-called high exposure was either heavy or frequent . There are some apparent inconsistencies with the Costello et al.21 paper . The genetic findings were similar for younger age o61 years and older subjects . This seems difficult to reconcile with the report of Costello in which associations were different between younger and older subjects and there is a further problem in the use of �zero� and �low� exposures , combined , to designate the reference value for exposure to pesticide . Other findings are difficult to interpret . For example , Table 3 of that study shows that the association between number of alleles and PD risk occurs at 3 ? , not 2 ? , alleles and thus it is unclear why 2 ? is used in Table 4 . Importantly , a 2 2 2 interaction paraquat , maneb and genetic susceptibility in at least dichotomous categories is reported for 324 cases . Several thousand cases would indeed be required to document gene�environment interactions.23 It is established that most positive results in underpowered studies are false positives 24,25 indeed , this issue has forced those undertaking genetic association studies to set statistical significance limits at Pp10 6 . The major finding of the study relating to gene�environment interaction is illustrated in Table 4 of that study , which shows that alleles in the 50 and 30 region of the DAT gene have little or no association with PD except in the presence of �high� exposure as defined , uniquely , in this study . This �high� exposure is not associated with PD OR ? 0.88 for zero alleles except when 1 ? alleles are present . The researchers suggest that in the presence of �high� pesticide exposure and one allele , the OR increases to 2.99 . The presence of 2 ? alleles most of the individuals with 2 ? alleles have 2 alleles and approximately 30 % have 3 ? increases the OR to 4.53 a true interaction would have suggested an OR 46 additive or 49 multiplicative . In conclusion , the evidence available from epidemiological studies is fragmentary and insufficient to establish whether herbicides and PQ in particular increase the risk for PD . The overall epidemiological evidence from combined exposure studies and those limited to PQ does not support the existence of a specific association between PQ and PD . Chemical properties and distribution . PQ 1,10-dimethyl 4,40-bipyridinium in its reduced form is a member of a chemical class known as bipyridyl derivatives , which includes diquat 1,10-ethylene-2,20-bipyridylium dibromide and cyperquat that has the same structure as the MPTP metabolite MPP ? see below . One-electron reduction of PQ26�29 probably underlies its toxic effects in the lung after accidental ingestion . Reduced PQ is then rapidly re-oxidized to its cation form by molecular oxygen with the formation of superoxide radicals in a classical redox-cycling reaction . Because PQ is highly polar , it is poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract . Over 50 % of a single dose administered to rats localizes to the gut at some 32 h after administration30 and only approximately 5 to 10 % of an ingested dose is absorbed , although the presence of emulsifiers and or co-solvents may enhance absorption . Excretion occurs in urine and faeces with approximately 45 % of a single dose being excreted after 48 h in rats . Because of these properties and some early evidence that PQ is largely excluded from the brain , 31 it has been assumed that PQ would not cross the blood-brain barrier BBB to a significant extent . After a single administration , most of the PQ that reaches the brain is apparently associated with structures outside the BBB i.e. , the pineal gland and the cerebral ventricles or with three areas of the brain the anterior portion of the olfactory bulb , the hypothalamus and the area postrema , which do not have a tight BBB.32 Shimizu and colleagues33 challenged these initial observa-tions . Using a brain microdialysis technique in rats , they showed that PQ could be found in the dialysate after subcutaneous administration . The researchers suggested that penetration of PQ into the brain did not result from the destruction of BBB function by PQ or a PQ radical , but suggested that PQ is taken up into the brain through the neutral amino acid transport system and then transported into striatal cells . However , this study was carried out in young animals and the possibility exists that age-dependent changes in the BBB may be critical for the uptake of PQ in brain . Several studies now agree that PQ penetration into the brain is an age-dependent phenomenon . Higher PQ levels can be found in neonatal brains compared with brain regions of adult and elderly rats , 32 or in either very young 2 weeks old or very old 12 and 24 months old animals when compared with normal adult 3-month-old rats .34,35 Thus , it is apparent that neonatal or very young animals are better able to sequester PQ . Because PQ can cross the placental barrier , studies in which exposure occurs before birth or in general before the full development of a competent BBB are of little significance in unveiling the potential risk of developing PD after exposure to PQ . Neurotoxicity of PQ , MPTP and other dopamine congeners . Several studies suggest that systemic administration of PQ can cause neuronal damage and a parkinsonian-like syndrome in experimental animals primarily C57Bl 6 mice or rats . The linking mechanism between PQ exposure and Parkinson�s disease is suggested by the alleged chemical similarity between this compound and others known to cause a parkinsonian syndrome , particularly MPTP . MPTP can reproduce most of the biochemical , neuropathological and clinical characteristics of human parkinsonism in both human and non-human primates , 36 with the notable exception of Lewy body formation . MPTP toxicity has been studied in cell systems in mice and in non-human primates . In rats , dopaminergic neurodegeneration is observed at high doses , 37 whereas mice have become the most commonly used species for MPTP studies as they develop a dopaminergic degeneration that may be related to human parkinsonism . The chemical similarity between MPTP MPP ? and PQ has been regarded as evidence for a similar cytotoxic mechanism and a common route of brain penetration . Nevertheless , the obvious difference in polarity between PQ and MPTP has implications for their ability to cross the BBB . Studies on brain distribution of PQ in rodents have produced disparate results . The evidence can be summarized as follows PQ brain penetration is an age-and species-dependent process , with young mice o8 weeks being more susceptible to PQ brain accumulation . In contrast , there is no doubt that MPTP can cross the BBB and cause toxicity after being metabolized to MPP ? . MPP ? is non-neurotoxic when administered systemi-cally . PQ has two positive charges and thus different biological properties affecting both its transport across the BBB and its cellular uptake . PQ is not transported by the dopamine carrier � as believed initially � and does not affect dopamine uptake.38,39 The initial biochemical lesions produced by PQ and MPP ? differ substantially . The primary mechanism of MPP ? toxicity is impairment of mitochondrial respiration by the inhibition of complex I of the electron transport chain . This may result in excess radical formation and subsequent oxidative nitrosative stress . Unlike MPP ? , PQ exerts its toxicity by cellular redox cycling , 28,29,40 although a recent study in isolated mitochon-dria questions previous findings and indicates complex I as a target for PQ.41 In clear contrast with the latter study , recent work suggests that PQ can still exert neurotoxic effects after a knock down of complex I.42 Notably , this study also suggests that complex I is not involved in MPP ? toxicity , and therefore it concludes that complex I is not relevant in PD . The latter conclusion is arguable . It is necessary to realize that redox active agents may interact with different electron acceptor donors depending on the redox potential and the reducing environment . Thus , removing one or more electron acceptors donors may simply shift redox reaction to the next best biological partner . Although it is generally accepted that PQ will cause cellular toxicity by oxidative stress , it is difficult to reach a definitive conclusion on PQ major intracellular targets . Work in dopaminergic neurons has shown that the most effective redox cyclers also cause the highest degree of dopaminergic cell injury.28 Most notably , of three pesticides selected in this study , PQ was the least toxic . Further evidence that oxidative stress is the predominant mecha-nism by which PQ causes toxicity is the generation of 4-hydroxynonenals in vivo.27 It is possible to conclude from these studies that the mechanisms of toxicity of PQ in neuronal cultures , cell lines and non-neuronal cells lung , kidney and hepatocytes are similar . It is clear that a chemical that is capable of triggering redox cycling oxidative stress will do it regardless of the cellular system in which it operates in the presence of an adequate electron donor . The issue is therefore whether dopaminergic neurons and selective subpopulations of other brain cells will sequester sufficient PQ to trigger a lethal oxidative stress . As indicated above , most studies in vitro will inevitably show this paradigm . Studies in vivo also seem to suggest this possibility . However , many studies in the literature are carried out in species that may have a high intrinsic sensitivity to neurotoxicants C57 BL6 or in relatively young animals ca 8�12 weeks old in which PQ uptake may be more significant . Caution should be exercised when deciding whether sensitivity to PQ toxicity of a given strain may reflect PQ penetration into the brain or rather an inbred trait for increased susceptibility . Because PQ distribution in rats and mice may differ and as there are no age-related studies analysing the distribution and toxicity of PQ in vivo in different species under the same experimental conditions , our knowledge of PQ distribution in brain and its relation to neurotoxicity remains fragmentary . A schematic description of the reactions and CNS cells involved in cell death by PQ and MPTP is presented in Figure 1 . Notably , gene expression patterns differ significantly after exposure to either PQ or MPP ? 43 Although both chemicals engage the ubiquitin-dependent protein catabolism to pro-mote toxicity , overall their adverse effects are regulated by non-overlapping sets of conserved genes in yeast experi-ments . Notably , 80 and 76 % of enriched yeast genes that show sensitivity to MPP ? and PQ toxicity , respectively , have highly conserved homologues in the human genome , which suggest that similar studies in mammalian cells may reveal analogous differences . From these data , it seems plausible that although some downstream processes triggered by PQ and MPP ? are shared the activation of the ubiquitin proteasome system the initial steps that lead to the activation of this system may be different . Thus , PQ and MPTP seem to engage different cytotoxic mechanisms . Despite studies in which PQ is used to model redox cycling , 41 PQ is not an efficient inhibitor of mitochondrial complex I IC50 of 7 mM .39 A major difference in the interaction with cellular proteins between PQ and complex I acting chemicals is also highlighted in a study carried out in C. elegans , in which the patterns of vulnerability and rescue have been compared after genetic manipulation.44 Ved et al.44 created a susceptibility model in C. elegans by overexpres-sing a-synuclein which is normally not expressed in the worm and deleting Parkin or knocking down DJ-1 . C. elegans lines with these transgenic traits were more vulnerable than non-transgenic worms to mitochondrial complex I inhibitors including Rotenone . However , the sensitivity to PQ did not increase . In a study by Ramachandiran et al. , 38 it is shown that PQ specifically oxidizes the cytosolic form of thyoredoxin and activates JNK and caspase 3 . Conversely , MPP ? and rotenone , which directly affect complex I activity , oxidize the mitochondrial form of thioredoxin without activating JNK or caspase 3 . In both cases , loading cells with exogenous dopamine does not exacerbate the toxicity of either com-pound . These data suggest that oxidative modification of cytosolic proteins is important for PQ toxicity , whereas inactivation or oxidation of mitochondrial proteins is more important for MPP ? and rotenone toxicity . In addition , intracellular dopamine does not seem to exacerbate the toxicity of these dopaminergic neurotoxicants , at least in this model . It is apparent from this analysis that the initial targets and toxicity mechanisms of PQ and MPP ? differ although all may share an oxidative component . Modelling PD in rodents and simple organisms . Impaired mitochondrial function is a predominant feature in cases of Parkinson�s� disease due to genetic or environmental modifications , which result in �mitochondrial stress� . This may directly compromise the neuron or cause alterations in neurotransmitter release , resulting in post-synaptic damage . A pro-inflammatory component is increasingly considered to be important in the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative conditions including PD , 45 and pro-inflammatory activation of glial cells may be pivotal in disease onset.46,47 Although many of the genes involved in PD have been identified , their interactions are still unclear . Mutations of a-synuclein or duplications of a-synuclein are linked to familial PD and a-synuclein is a component of Lewy bodies . a-synuclein tends to form intracellular fibrils and aggregates , particularly after oxidative stress . Loss of an ubiquitin ligase , Parkin , is responsible for autosomal recessive juvenile parkinsonism . Finally , mutations in genes coding for UCH-L1 and Pink-1 are linked to autosomal recessive PD , whereas mutations in LRRK2 are linked with autosomal dominant PD . Recent work has shown that mutations in the mitochondrial protease HtrA248 are also linked to PD downstream of the kinase , Pink 1.49 Mutations in Parkin are recognized as the most common cause of familial parkinsonism and may be involved in sporadic PD . Parkin seems to work as a broad-spectrum neuroprotectant , the efficacy of which decreases with ageing.50 With a better understanding of the genetic alterations involved in familial PD , several transgenic mouse models have been generated that can reproduce many features of parkinsonism . Animal models generated by mutations or deletions of the relevant Parkinson-related genes have also been used to examine the effects of PQ . Manning-Bog et al.51,52 have shown that PQ can cause a-synuclein aggregation in wt C57Bl 6 mice , whereas overexpression of a-synuclein protects against herbicide toxicity . MPP ? , rote-none and PQ have all been shown to alter Parkin solubility , which facilitates its aggregation , decreases proteasome activity and causes cell injury and death.53 In contrast , in the C. elegans controlled genetic background , the sensitivity model proposed by Ved et al.44 has shown that PQ toxicity is not enhanced by the Parkinson-linked genetic modifications , at variance with chemicals exerting an effect specifically on mitochondrial complex I . These observations do not resolve the question of whether PQ exposure can realistically facilitate the onset of PD in humans . The additional stress triggered by any redox-cycling agent in genetically susceptible animal models may indeed prompt the development of pathological features . In line with this assumption are observations that PQ increases fibrillar aggregation of a-synuclein.54 Notably , the protection by a-synuclein overexpression is independent of PQ-induced formation of synuclein aggregates.51 There are several intrinsic limitations in modelling PD by chemical or genetic manipulation . The major controversy about the use of chemically induced models of PD has been related to the lack of certain critical features of human parkinsonism and therefore the potential value of the model systems to study neuroprotective therapeutics . For example , rodent exposure to 6-hydroxydopamine has been used extensively to model damage in catecholaminergic neurons and induce dopaminergic neuronal death , but it neither shows the formation of cytoplasmic inclusion Lewy bodies nor involves other brain areas normally affected in PD . Reports of parkinsonian-like tremor are very rare in studies of 6-hydroxydopamine-injured rodents and only occasionally have akinesia and rigidity been described . Finally , the mechanism by which 6-hydroxydopamine can kill neurons does not necessarily reflect the mechanism that is involved in spontaneous PD in humans . In MPTP-treated animals a number of symptoms replicate PD and MPTP exposure has been shown to cause parkinson-ism in humans . However , the slow progression of the idiopathic human disease , the clinical symptoms of the movement disorder and the classical Lewy body formation are not reproduced . In general , the animal models of PD , including toxin-induced models , fulfil most of the required features , but not all of them , and therefore can not be taken as bona fide models for PD . This is recognized widely in the field and research progresses towards models that recapitulate more closely the features of human parkinsonism . These should include 1 a normal set of nigral-dopaminergic neurons at birth followed by a selective gradual loss of these cells beginning in adulthood 2 easily detectable and quantifiable model deficit , for example , akinesia , rigidity and tremor and 3 formation of Lewy bodies . Multiple hits Rodent Studies and the Hypothesis that Multiple Triggers cause Neurodegeneration Perinatal exposure PQ as a sensitizer . Studies primarily from the Cory-Slechta group55�57 have suggested that exposure to PQ and maneb a dithiocarbamate pesticide during the prenatal and perinatal period can either cause a reduction in the number of dopamine neurons directly , or cause an increased susceptibility to degeneration of these neurons after subsequent environmental insults or as a result of ageing . It is interesting that exposure to the pro-inflammatory agent LPS can sensitize neurons in a similar manner . This would suggest that sensitizing environmental factors and or inflammatory conditions in the perinatal period might favour the early onset of parkinsonism . It is conceivable that any pro-oxidant that can cross the BBB and the placental barrier may interfere with normal neurodevelopment with delayed consequences . However , although PQ may cause developmental or post-develop-mental effects in rodents , the relevance of such studies to help understanding PQ neurotoxicity in humans is limited . Although it is plausible that PQ may cross the placental barrier , it is unclear to what extent . In addition , there is no evidence to date that 1 environmental exposure of pregnant women is significant and 2 PQ gestational exposure is linked to early-onset PD in humans . Finally , there is no convincing evidence that perinatal inflammation � which is far more common than PQ exposure � increases risk for PD . In support of this hypothesis , there is a single additional study . Gravid female rats were injected intraperitoneally with LPS at embryonic day 10.5.58 Pups showed reduced numbers of tyrosine hydroxylase positive neurons , an effect that was still present at 33 days after a single injection of LPS . Thus , perinatal rodent exposure models may help to unveil biological interactions , but are obviously inappropriate as models of human exposure and its consequences . The pro-inflammatory or �multiple hits� hypothesis . Recent work by Purisai et al.59 has shown that administration of three weekly injections of PQ causes a significant loss of the dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra , pars compacta . Along with these findings is the observation that treatment with PQ increases the levels of a-synuclein . In this paradigm , a single PQ injection did not produce toxic effects , whereas subsequent injections triggered oxidative injury and neurotoxicity . PQ accumulation may explain this finding . However , repeated injections of PQ would be expected to produce a progressive pattern of neurodegeneration . Instead , after three different exposures , only the second PQ treatment caused a significant loss of nigral striatal neurons . Another explanation may be that the initial exposure can exert an effect as a priming event , enhancing neuronal vulnerability to a subsequent toxic insult . This �multiple hit� hypothesis implies that neurodegeneration would begin shortly after two PQ injections and would progress over the following few days . Once the maximum effect is reached after the second exposure , no further cell loss occurs . According to this paradigm , the first injection would sensitize brain cells in a non-lethal way whereas the second injection would trigger irreversible injury . Purisai et al.59 suggest that neurotoxicity of PQ , as well as other pro-oxidants that indeed cross the BBB , may be due to a two-tiered effect , priming perhaps of microglia and a secondary injury to the neurons because of the combination of a pro-inflammatory response and a direct neuronal oxidative stress . The major source of oxidative stress may in fact , be the resident microglia . In Purisai et al.59 studies there is evidence that a single PQ dose is sufficient to increase the number of cells with immunohistochemical , morphological and biochemical characteristics of activated microglia , including the induction of NADPH oxidase . The anti-inflammatory drug , myocyclin , blocks this microglial response and under these circumstances , PQ fails to cause both oxidative stress and neurodegeneration in subsequent exposures . If microglial activation is induced by pre-treatment with lipopolisaccaride LPS , a single PQ exposure becomes capable of triggering loss of dopaminergic neurons . A final experiment using mutant mice that lack functional NADPH oxidase shows that these animals were spared from neurodegeneration caused by repeated PQ exposure . These data therefore suggest that microglial activation and the consequent induction of NADPH oxidase may exert an effect as risk factors for the dopaminergic neuronal loss in rodents . It is unclear whether this paradigm applies to human parkinsonism . In addition , given the frequency of pro-inflammatory events in life , one may ask what would be the role of a rather infrequent exposure to PQ in comparison . Nevertheless , this working hypothesis fits with the general idea that neurodegenerative conditions may be caused by a series of unrelated events . Priming may include genetic factors , which would make certain neuronal populations or individuals more sensitive to subsequent environmental factors . The latter may be triggers of inflammation or exposure to toxic compounds . The reason why dopaminergic neurons may be more sensitive to oxidative stress can be explained by a number of findings expression levels of stress-related proteins49 or an increased sensitivity of mitochondria to oxidative stress . This would explain why compounds , such as 6-OH-dopamine , MPP ? or PQ with apparently distinct cytotoxic triggers , can promote a parkinsonian syndrome if injected systemically . However , because LPS sensitizes to other unrelated forms of brain injury e.g. , tau pathology , 60 and because the sensitization is carried out with an LPS pre-treatment protocol , it may be likely that these experiments only reveal an intrinsic weakness of the animal model . Although there is increasing evidence that pro-inflammatory conditions can facilitate onset of neurodegeneration , there is no firm evidence that even repetitive pro-inflammatory events in humans are linked to PD . Cell death mechanisms and neurodegeneration . Although transgenic animal models are becoming more and more sophisticated , rodent models for neurodegenerative diseases , in particular Alzheimer�s and Parkinson�s diseases , are still inadequate . Neither PQ nor other chemical agents do indeed model human PD . The complex and slow progressive pathology in humans is hardly mimicked by the rapid disruption of nigro-striatal neurons in the rodent chemical models . Despite this obvious problem , chemicals have long been used to mimic neurodegenerative condi-tions in the brain . Of these , some are used to induce pharmacological lesions , such as 6-hydroxydopamine , but obviously there is no relation with human exposure . Others such as MPTP have become widely used tools because of cases of human toxicity . Finally , PQ has become a tool for the alleged chemical similarity with MPTP because of being a widely used agent in agriculture , but to date there is no evidence that links it to parkinsonism in humans . In fact , none of the chemicals above produce the progressive lesions that characterize neurodegenerative diseases . The latter develop in humans over decades and most likely do not result from a rapid neuronal death as that caused by chemicals . There is mounting evidence that loss of synaptic connectivity , axonal and dendritic damage take place long before cell death mechanisms are activated . The latter being apoptotic or necrotic seem to be initially restricted to neurons . Many pathways are now believed to converge on mitochondria . Protein misfolding , disorders in axonal trafficking , and vesicle recycling or genetic mutations in the nuclear or mitochondrial genomes can compromise mitochondrial function and lead to loss of synapses and or neuronal death Figure 2 . The chemicals discussed in this study can directly or indirectly affect mitochondrial function and therefore cause neurodegeneration in cultured neurons , in animal models or , in some cases , in humans . Any mitochondrial toxin that would be experimentally forced to gain access to neurons in high-enough concentrations would likely cause a similar damage , without necessarily posing a real risk to human health . Therefore , although informative , chemical models have little relevance in the understanding of how neurodegenerative diseases develop and progressively damage the nervous system . The scientific process leading to identification of human risk is complex and involves both epidemiological and experimental data . Epidemiological or clinical studies may identify associa-tions between a given pathology and known risk factors , but risk evaluation is more difficult when epidemiological and clinical data are lacking or incomplete . In such cases , animal experimentation is essential to establish whether or not there is an increased risk . Identification of effects in animals , and understanding the targets and mechanism of action , pharma-cokinetics and tissue distribution are essential in the determination of risk . The epidemiological and clinical evidence that PQ may favour the onset of PD is inconclusive . The experimental studies that might inform us do not reflect human exposure , they are performed in selected strains which may show increased sensitivity and they reveal an increased sensitivity to oxidative damage of a subset of neurons , regardless of the pro-oxidant used . They offer a plausible hypothesis of how PQ may exert an effect on rodents , but provide little or no help with risk prediction in humans . Public and often scientific perception of risk is based on extrapolation and approximation . The precautionary principle is the bane of a truly scientific approach , but one behind which we comfortably hide when we do not know better . In the case of PQ , the link between experiments in rodents and potential human adverse effects is weak . Nevertheless , it is likely that the work on animals linked to low-stringency epidemiological evidence will create concern . To definitely answer the question of PQ toxicity in humans , better epidemiological studies and thorough studies in primates will be required . Conflict of interest Over the past several years , the researchers have worked with pharmaceutical and chemical companies as external advisors . This work reflects their scientific experience and independent views . S9�18 . R183�R194 . 51 . Manning-Bog AB , McCormack AL , Li J , Uversky VN , Fink AL , Di Monte DA .

20111042	www.nature.com cdd Due to continuous exposure to genotoxic stress resulting from exogenous and endogenous sources , protection of genomic integrity is a major challenge for living cells . Failure to repair DNA lesions often leads to cell death , genomic instability , and tumorigenesis.1,2 Terminally differentiated neurons are highly susceptible to oxidative DNA damage due to their high rate of oxidative metabolism.3 For this reason , DNA repair is highly important for these cells.2,4 The mechanisms of DNA repair have been investigated mainly in proliferating cells . In these cells , the cell-cycle machinery is a part of the DNA-damage response DDR , involved in both DNA repair and apoptosis.5 DNA repair in terminally differentiated cells is not expected to be linked to the cell cycle . However , increasing evidence indicates that the cell-cycle machinery plays a key role in different processes in terminally differentiated cells 6,7 for example , cell-cycle activation is essential for apoptotic signaling in neurons.3,8,9 Expression of cell-cycle proteins has been observed at physiological conditions in terminally differentiated neurons , 7 but the functional relevance of this expression remains unknown . Since DNA repair is generally attenuated by differentiation in most types of cells , 10,11 the expression of cell-cycle-related proteins may reflect the need of resting cells to re-enter the cell cycle in order to activate DNA repair . Our recent data demonstrating that cell-cycle-related proteins are expressed in neurons exposed to repairable DNA damage , also support the existence of a link between the cell-cycle machinery and DNA repair in postmitotic cells.12 Although cells in most mammalian tissues enter a terminally arrested G0 phase at some point during their life , the mechanisms regulating the maintenance of G0 and G0-G1 transition are not fully understood . The retinoblastoma protein pRb plays a crucial role in cell-cycle regulation.13 Recently , the cyclin-C cyclin-dependent kinase-3 CDK3 complex was shown to facilitate exit from G0 into the cell cycle by pRb phosphorylation at serines S 807 and 811 . This cyclin-C-associated kinase activity peaked shortly after mitogenic stimulation of quiescent cells in early G1.14 During exit from G0 , the cyclin-C CDK3 complex directed pRb phosphorylation at S807 811 in a temporal pattern that preceded pRb phosphorylation by cyclin-D CDK4 , cyclin-D CDK6 , and cyclin-E CDK2.14 The levels of cyclin-E protein and asso-ciated kinase activity rise in the late G1 phase.15 As double-strand breaks DSBs are the most lethal form of DNA damage , 16 maintenance of genomic integrity depends on efficient and accurate DSB repair . Mammalian cells repair DSBs by two pathways homologous recombina-tion and non-homologous end-joining NHEJ . NHEJ is predominant in mammalian cells.17 NHEJ starts with the binding of Ku70 Ku80 Ku heterodimer to the broken DNA ends . Ku facilitates the recruitment of Artemis-DNA�protein-kinase catalytic subunit PKcs complex , which processes the ends to prepare them for ligation.17 In this study , we found that activation of NHEJ in postmitotic neurons was accompanied by phosphorylation of pRb at S807 811 directed by cyclin-C-associated kinase activity , which was previously shown to be sufficient for G0-G1 transition.14 The abrogation of cell-cycle entry compromised NHEJ repair , while forcing G1 entry caused NHEJ activation even in the absence of DNA lesions . Together , these results suggest the need for resting cells to re-enter the cell cycle to activate the NHEJ repair machinery . Results 5 lM H2O2 generates repairable DSBs in postmitotic neurons . To investigate the effect of non-lethal DSBs on neurons , we exposed postmitotic rat cortical neurons to repairable DNA damage generated by hydrogen peroxide H2O2 . H2O2 , a product of normal oxygen metabolism , is extensively used to induce oxidative stress in cell culture cell models and is known to induce DSBs.12,16 Cultures of cortical neurons , according to our previous results , yielded B99 % pure neuronal populations . The purity of neuronal populations was controlled by the expression of the specific neuronal marker , NeuN data not shown . Previously , we demonstrated that 5 mM H2O2 induces repairable DSBs and does not induce apoptosis in postmitotic cortical neurons.12 We used phosphorylated H2AX gH2AX as a marker of DSB formation.12 The kinetics of gH2AX accumulation demonstrates the repairable character of DSBs induced by 5 mM H2O2 , as illustrated by a significant increase in gH2AX expression compared with that in untreated neurons , followed by its significant reduction Figure 1a . The analysis of apoptotic markers , including cleavage of caspase-3 Figure 1b and examination of apoptotic neuron nuclei data not shown , revealed that by 24 h after exposure b c to 5 mM H2O2 , the neuronal cultures did not undergo apoptosis , consistent with our data on gH2AX expression . Previously , we demonstrated the repairable character of DSBs generated by 5 mM H2O2 using comet assay and by testing apoptotic markers , cleavage of nuclear Mcm3 and cytoplasmic b-actin caspase-3 substrates.12 G0-G1 transition in neurons exposed to DSBs . DSB induction was accompanied by early activation of cell-cycle-regulatory proteins , including phosphorylation of pRb at S807 811 , required for G0 exit 14 and expression of transcription factor E2F1 Figure 1c . E2F1 gene expression is known to rise as cells exit from G0 and undergo G0-G1 transition.13 Cyclin-C levels were high in postmitotic neurons , consistent with those seen in G0-arrested cells of non-neuronal origin14 and were not changed significantly after H2O2 treatment , although cyclin-C levels were typically highest by 1 h after treatment . Cyclin-C immunoprecipitates from lysates of cortical neurons revealed pRb-kinase activity at 1 and 2 h after H2O2 treatment Figure 1d . In contrast to cyclin-C , its partner CDK3 was not expressed in G0 neurons , but CDK3 levels significantly increased after H2O2 exposure Figure 1c . Co-immunoprecipitation experiments demon-strate that the anti-CDK3 precipitate contains cyclin-C Figure 1e . pRb-kinase activity associated with cyclin-D1 was not seen until at least 4 h of treatment Figure 1d . No cyclin-E-associated pRb-kinase activity was found Figure 1d . Coexpression of the neuronal marker NeuN and the marker of proliferating cells , Ki-67,12 was observed in neurons by 1 h of H2O2 exposure but not in untreated neurons Figure 2 , confirming the entrance of postmitotic neurons into the cell cycle upon non-lethal DSB DNA damage . This suggests that the response to DSB formation in postmitotic neurons is associated with cyclin-C-directed pRb phosphorylation that precedes pRb phosphorylation directed by cyclin-D1 , but is not associated with cyclin-E-dependent pRb-kinase activity late G1 . Such early pRb phosphorylation at S807 811 is consistent with previously observed pRb phosphorylation at S807 811 in T-lymphocytes and T98G cells during exit from G0.14,18 Postmitotic neurons activate NHEJ upon DNA DSB damage . Next , we examined NHEJ activation in postmitotic neurons exposed to 5 mM H2O2 . Since Ku-DNA binding is crucial for NHEJ-mediated repair , 17 we first assessed the DNA-binding activity of Ku proteins in neuronal extracts by immune recognition of an epitope on Ku70 or Ku86 that is accessible upon DNA binding.19 The analysis of NHEJ activity was performed based on in vitro end-joining of linearized plasmid DNA using cell-free extracts.20 This DNA-end ligation assay , which results in the formation of DNA concatemers , requires a functional NHEJ apparatus , as seen in the absence of DNA oligomers when using extract from untreated undamaged neurons Figure 3b . Both Ku-DNA-binding and end-joining kinetics revealed early NHEJ activation at 1�2h after H2O2 exposure followed by decrease of both parameters to levels seen in untreated cells Figures 3a and b . To relate NHEJ activation to neurons , we assessed the coexpression of the neuronal marker NeuN and DNA�PKcs phosphorylated at threonine T 2609 as a marker of activated NHEJ . As previously described , DNA�PKcs phosphorylation at this site is required for NHEJ activation , and mutations at the T2609 cluster severely compromised the ability of DNA� PKcs to restore DSB-repair defects in DNA�PKcs-deficient cells.21,22 The results of immunofluorescence analysis revealed the colocalization of both neuronal and NHEJ activation markers in cells at 1h of H2O2 exposure but not in untreated cells Figure 3c . These data show that early and brief NHEJ activity is sufficient for DSB repair in postmitotic neurons exposed to a non-lethal DNA-damaging insult . Importantly , this timing of NHEJ activation coincided tightly with the timing of cyclin-C-associated pRb-kinase activity Figure 1d , essential for G0-G1 transition in postmitotic cells . Interestingly , pRb-kinase activity associated with cyclin-D1 was observed outside of the time frame of NHEJ activity at 4h after H2O2 exposure , although this activity was indeed induced in postmitotic neurons after DSBs , in contrast to cyclin-E-dependent pRb-kinase activity , which was not induced Figure 1d . Suppression of G0-G1 transition attenuates NHEJ activation . To determine the functional role of cell-cycle activation and particular roles for cyclin-C-and cyclin-D-associated phosphorylation of pRb in DSB repair in postmitotic neurons , we prevented G0-G1 transition by silencing cyclin-C or Cdc25A . Cyclin-C suppression was previously shown to affect G0 exit.14 Cdc25A is a member of the cell division cycle-25 Cdc25 family of proteins that function by dephosphorylating CDK subunits , and thereby activating the CDK cyclin complex . Cdc25A is involved in the activation of cyclin-E-and cyclin-D1-associated kinase activities and pRb phosphorylation.23 This suggests that Cdc25A suppression should not affect cyclin-C-associated pRb phosphorylation , which precedes pRb phosphorylation by cyclin-D CDK4 6 and cyclin-E CDK2 . The suppression of cyclin-C in cortical neurons by cyclin-C siRNA resulted in decreased levels of cyclin-C protein and an almost complete blockade of cyclin-C-associated pRb-kinase activity Figures 4a and b , as well as cyclin-D1-associated pRb-kinase activity data not shown . Cyclin-C silencing compromised DSB repair in neurons exposed to 5 mM H2O2 , in contrast to neurons transfected with control siRNA , as evidenced by attenuation of both Ku-DNA-binding and end-joining activities Figures 4e and f . The lack of decrease in gH2AX levels in neurons transfected with cyclin-C siRNA that 30 End were treated with 5 mM H2O2 Figure 4c , suggests that these neurons failed to repair the DSBs and supports the hypothesis that NHEJ is impaired by silencing cyclin-C . Interestingly , compromised DSB repair in these neurons did not lead to apoptosis , as evidenced by the absence of caspase-3 cleavage . Basically the same pattern of change in NHEJ activity was observed in postmitotic neurons after reducing Cdc25A levels , although reduction of NHEJ activity tended to be lower than that in cells with suppressed cyclin-C Figures 4e and f . This may reflect a smaller suppression of Cdc25A protein expression . Surprisingly , Cdc25A suppression affected cyclin-C-associated pRb-kinase activity Figure 4b , suggesting that Cdc25A is involved not only in cyclin-E-and cyclin-D1-associated kinase activities , 23 but is also involved in cyclin-C-associated kinase activity . Forced G1 entry causes NHEJ activation in the absence of DSB lesions . To further define the requirement of cell-cycle re-entry for NHEJ activation in postmitotic neurons , we examined the effects of forced cell-cycle entry on NHEJ activation . To force cell-cycle reactivation , we suppressed p21 expression by siRNA . p21 is a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor CKI , which is also involved in DNA-damage signaling and whose suppression by siRNA was previously shown to efficiently trigger DNA synthesis in primary , terminally differentiated skeletal muscle cells and quiescent fibroblasts.24 Reactivation of the cell cycle observed in quiescent cells upon overexpression of active cell-cycle factors , E2F1 and Cdc25A , or upon suppression of p21 was a siRNA CycC siRNA Con d Cleaved Cyclin C caspase-3 ? -tubulin ? -tubulin Binding ? -tubulin 5 ? M H2O2 � + � + 0.3 accompanied by DNA replication and apoptosis.23�26 In our experiments , p21 siRNA , unlike a control siRNA , reduced p21 protein levels and led to entry into S-phase , as demonstrated by the appearance of cyclin-E-associated pRb-kinase activity Figures 5a and b . Consistent with previous findings , 24 postmitotic cortical neurons transfected with p21 siRNA underwent apoptosis by 24 h after trans-fection Figure 5e . To avoid the S-phase entry and ensuing apoptosis , and to determine the direct impact of G0-G1 transition on the DNA-repair machinery in postmitotic neurons , we combined p21 suppression with the targeting CDK2 , critical for G1-S transition.13 Since we observed cyclin-E-associated pRb activity by 4 h and apoptosis by 24 h after p21 siRNA transfection Figures 5b , d and e , we decided to examine the expression of p21 and CDK2 , as well as expression of cell-cycle markers E2F1 , cyclin-C - , cyclin-D1 and cyclin-E-associated pRb-kinase activities , in cortical neurons cotransfected with p21 and CDK2 as early as 1 h after transfection . The specificity of the transfection was ascertained by the ability of siRNAs to lower p21 and CDK2 protein levels and to induce a massive early by 1 h after transfection re-entry of neurons into the cell cycle , but not S-phase , as measured by E2F1 expression , cyclin-C - , cyclin-D1 but not cyclin-E-associated pRb-kinase activities , in contrast to the silencing of p21 alone Figure 5 . The specificity of transfection was also supported by the absence of apoptosis usually associated with S-phase entry Figure 5e , and DSBs the lack of gH2AX expression , which labels apoptotic cells Figure 5d . To determine whether G0-G1 transition in postmitotic neurons is sufficient for initiation of NHEJ repair machinery , we determined the parameters of NHEJ activation in p21 CDK2 siRNA-transfected neurons . p21 CDK2 silencing initiated a significant increase in Ku-DNA-binding and DNA�PK activity Figures 6a and b . DNA�PK activity assay is based on kinase activity analysis of whole DNA complex composed of two subunits , Ku and DNA�PKcs . We next determined whether G0-G1 transition induces end-joining activation . NHEJ acti-vity in p21 CDK2 siRNA-transfected neurons was significantly higher than that in neurons transfected with control siRNA Figure 6c . Importantly , NHEJ activation was short 1 and 2h after transfection and coincided with the timing of increased 1 2 4 Con End 20 Relative 10 0 cyclin-C-associated pRb-kinase activity Figure 5b , as it was observed in neurons exposed to 5 mM H2O2 Figures 1 and 3 . Discussion The expression of various canonical cell-cycle regulators in differentiated neurons of the adult brain observed under normal conditions , suggests that they have a physiological function , 6,7 but this function remains unknown . Given the attenuation of the DNA-repair capacity following differentia-tion in most cell types , 10,11 the expression of cell-cycle-related proteins may reflect the need for resting cells to re-enter the cell cycle to activate DNA repair . In mitotic cells , the cell-cycle machinery is an important component of the cellular response to DNA damage , involved in DNA repair and apoptosis.5 We and others have demonstrated that cell-cycle activation is essential for DNA-damage-induced apoptosis.3,8,9 Here , we show that kinase activity involved in the cell�s exit from G0 , only recently established to be associated with cyclin-C , 14 is required for activation of NHEJ repair in postmitotic neurons . Both increase in cyclin-C-associated pRb-kinase activity and NHEJ activation occurred shortly after cell�s exposure to H2O2 and showed very similar kinetics . The fact that these cells are undergoing G0-G1 transition is supported by our findings that E2F1 levels are elevated this occurs as cells undergo G0-G1 transition13 , and that pRb is phosphorylated at S807 811 . Cyclin-D1 but not cyclin-E -associated pRb-kinase activity was also induced as a result of DSB DNA damage , although cyclin-D1-associated pRb-kinase activity occurred outside of the time frame of NHEJ activity , suggesting that cyclin-D1-associated pRb-kinase activity may not be implicated in NHEJ repair . Thus , activation of NHEJ repair in postmitotic neurons was associated with entry into early G1 , driven by cyclin-C-associated pRb-kinase activity , but it was not associated with late G1 progression directed by cyclin-E-dependent pRb-kinase activity . The suppression of cyclin-C by siRNA was shown to delay exit from G0.14 We found that ablation of cyclin-C by siRNA significantly reduced cyclin-C-associated pRb-kinase activity induced by DNA damage , and attenuated NHEJ in neurons , as revealed by increased levels of gH2AX . These changes , however , did not lead to apoptosis , suggesting that cell-cycle activation is important for both DNA repair and apoptosis in postmitotic cells . Indeed , numerous studies have demon-strated that suppression of cell-cycle signaling leads to attenuation of DNA-damage-initiated neuronal apopto-sis.9,23,27 Thus , preventing cell-cycle activation disables both DNA repair and apoptosis , which may result in the accumula-tion of DNA lesions and cell death by a non-apoptotic mechanism . The effect of Cdc25A suppression on DSB DNA repair was not significantly different from the effect of cyclin-C ablation , although reduction of NHEJ activity was typically lower than in cells with reduced cyclin-C levels . We found that decreasing Cdc25A levels by siRNA attenuated cyclin-C-associated pRb-kinase activity , providing evidence for the involvement of Cdc25A in this activity , in addition to previously established cyclin-E-and cyclin-D-associated pRb-kinase activities.23 Thus , impeding cyclin-C-associated G0 exit attenuates NHEJ DNA repair . This finding underscores the functional significance of G0-G1 transition for NHEJ activation in postmitotic neurons . Additional validation of the importance of early G1 for NHEJ repair in postmitotic neurons comes from our observation that forcing G1 entry of postmitotic neurons induces NHEJ activation in the absence of DSB lesions . Previously , cells in quiescent states , including differentiation , were shown to be able to re-enter the cell cycle simply by removing appropriate CKIs . Interference with p21 was sufficient to reactivate the cell cycle and DNA synthesis in terminally differentiated skeletal muscle cells and quiescent fibroblasts.24 Reactivation of cell cycle and DNA replication has also been documented in quiescent cells overexpressing E2F1 and Cdc25A.23�26 Such reactivation of cell cycle and DNA replication were sufficient to promote neuronal death even in the absence of DNA damage.28 Given the possibility that DNA replication might play a decisive role in triggering apoptosis in differentiated cells forced into the cell cycle , we prevented DNA replication by silencing CDK2 , an essential kinase for G1-S transition.13 Indeed , joint silencing of p21 and CDK2 prevented both DNA replication and apoptosis , but did permit the initiation of cyclin-C-dependent pRb-kinase activity , exit from G0 and NHEJ induction . Thus , our results demonstrate that cyclin-C-associated pRb-kinase activity and the associated progression through early G1 are crucial for NHEJ repair . This is evidenced by 1 the coincidence of the initiation of cyclin-C-associated pRb-kinase activity with NHEJ activation , 2 attenuation of NHEJ repair by impeding cyclin-C-associated pRb-kinase activity and 3 NHEJ activation in response to forced G0-G1 transition . While cyclin-D1-associated pRb-kinase activity was induced in postmitotic neurons in response to DSBs or p21 CDK2 silencing , it occurred after cyclin-C-directed pRb-kinase activity and after NHEJ was activated thus , the role of cyclin-D1 in NHEJ activation remains to be established , as are the mechanisms preventing cells from initiation of cyclin-E-associated pRb-kinase activity and G1-S progression . In contrast with repairable DNA damage , which only requires progression through early G1 , DNA damage leading to neuronal death requires the cell-cycle machinery for entry into the S-phase and DNA replication in addition to G0-G1 transition cells can not enter S-phase without G0-G1 transition .9,24,28�32 Preventing DNA replication or S-phase entry attenuated apoptosis , while unrestricted progressing through G1-S led to apoptosis . The fatal effect of DNA replication can be explained by the fact that DNA replication itself is a potential source of DNA damage , 33 and unrepaired DNA lesions when they interfere with DNA replication , may lead to critical secondary lesions , which in turn may activate apoptotic signaling.34 Moreover , DNA replication in postmito-tic neurons undergoing apoptosis involves a highly error-prone polymerase-b pol-b , normally engaged in DNA repair35 instead of DNA polymerases , essential for canonical DNA synthesis . This may amplify DNA damage and generate apoptotic signaling in neurons if the DNA damage is not repaired . Depending on multiple factors , including the source and extent of an insult , DNA damage results in either repair of damaged DNA or destruction of the cell by apoptosis . The mechanisms responsible for this decision are far from being elucidated . The two processes are not mutually exclusive and DNA damage are orchestrated by components implicated in both processes . According to our results , cell-cycle activation occurs in response to DNA damage and is involved in both DNA repair and apoptosis in postmitotic neurons . Figure 7 represents our model for the involvement of the cell-cycle machinery in the DDR of postmitotic neurons . The cell-cycle machinery may play a role in mechanisms that are part of the DDR orchestrated by the ataxia telangiectasia mutated ATM protein , the key regulator of the DSB signaling.36 It may also in-volve elements of the DNA-repair machinery such as Ku70 Ku86 proteins , which , besides their vital role in DNA repair , have been implicated in apoptosis37 and cell-cycle regulation.38 Our studies were focused on postmitotic neurons . Whether the role for early G1 activation in DNA repair is limited to neurons and NHEJ , or may function in other types of terminally differentiated cells and other types of DNA-repair , remains to be addressed . The integrity of DNA is constantly being challenged by genotoxic stress resulting from exogenous sources and most importantly , by oxyradicals produced by normal metabolic processes.1,2 Due to a high rate of oxygen metabolism , the DNA of postmitotic neurons is under increased risk of damage from free radicals . For humans , given that the life span of postmitotic neurons is many decades , competent DNA repair could be critical for neuronal survival.3 Since DNA-damaging events occur continuously in living cells , a protective DNA-repair mechanism should be available . NHEJ activity and expression of cell-cycle markers were indeed observed in neurons of normal brain.6,7,39 Here , we demonstrate that this is not a coincidence . In response to DNA damage , neurons re-enter the cell cycle and activate NHEJ . This is a permanent process in normal brain and this explains why both expression of cell-cycle markers and NHEJ activity were observed in brain under physiological conditions . The results of microdialysis applied to direct measurement of H2O2 in the rat striatum demonstrate that the 5 mM H2O2 used in our study is close to the concentrations of H2O2 in normal brain , 40 underscoring the physiological implications of our results .

20111043	www.nature.com cdd Apoptosis-inducing factor AIF has initially been described as a mitochondrial intermembrane protein that is released from mitochondria under conditions of cell death induction and that can induce isolated nuclei to undergo nuclear shrinkage and chromatinolysis , two features that are classically associated with apoptosis.1 Since its discovery 10 years ago , the AIF protein has been characterized at the structural level , 2,3 and the AIF gene has been subjected to genetic manipulations in mice , flies , nematodes and yeast , revealing the phylogeneti-cally conserved contribution of AIF to cell death in multiple systems.4,5 After the mitochondrial import of the precursor AIF protein and the removal of its N-terminal 53 amino acids , which includes a mitochondrial localization sequence MLS , the processed mature human AIF 62 kDa is inserted into the inner mitochondrial membrane , with the N-terminus facing the matrix and with the C-terminal catalytic domain exposed to the intermembrane space.6 The mitochondrial AIF protein is an NAD P H oxidase7 whose local redox function is essential for optimal oxidative phosphorylation.8 Knockdown , deletion or hypomorphic mutation of AIF the harlequin or Hq mutation reduces the expression of complex I subunits in the respi-ratory chain , 8 thereby provoking a mitochondriopathy that leads to progressive neurodegeneration , photoreceptor loss and cardiomyopathy.9�13 The consistent finding that the targeting of AIF mostly affects the central nervous system CNS 9 might either be explained by the general tendency of complex I mitochondriopathies to manifest at the level of the CNS14 and or by an implication of AIF in the differentiation of neuronal cell precursors.12 On apoptotic stimuli , AIF , which is able to directly interact with DNA , 15 translocates to the nucleus and participates in chromatin condensation and chromatinolysis.16 The switch from the vital to the lethal functions of AIF is spatially regulated by its subcellular localization and tightly controlled by at least two processes i outer mitochondrial membrane permeabi-lization MOMP , which is regulated by multiple mitochondrial proteins including members of the Bcl-2 family , 17 ii activation of a series of non-caspase cysteine proteases including cal-pains and cathepsins that cleave the N-terminal membrane insertion domain at amino acid 101 , thus catalyzing the de-attachment of mature AIF from the inner mitochondrial membrane.5,6,18 The nuclear translocation of AIF could be inhibited by the overexpression of heat shock protein 70 , which can intercept AIF in the cytosol19 or deletion of cyclophilin A , which is required for AIF to move into the nucleus.20 In mice , the Hq mutation has been shown to reduce acute neuronal cell death after ischemia , hypoglycemia and neurotrauma in young animals , before they manifest the Hq-associated neurodegeneration.21 However , the Hq mutation had no cardioprotective effect13 and was not able to make islet beta cells more resistant to hydrogen peroxide-induced cell death , 22 suggesting that AIF contributes to lethal signaling in a cell type-specific manner . Through alternative splicing , the precursor mRNA tran-scribed from the AIF gene can give rise to several distinct proteins . Thus , alternative utilization of the exons 2a or 2b of the AIF gene 16 exons in total gives rise to AIF1 the originally described isoform of AIF or AIF2 which has been found in cDNA libraries from fetal mouse tissues , respec-tively . AIF1 and AIF2 only differ in a short stretch of their amino acid sequence in the N-terminal region that is removed from the mature protein as it translocates to the nucleus.23 Numerous functional studies have been performed on AIF1 , the most abundant and ubiquitous AIF isoform , whereas , AIF2 has not been further characterized . In addition to the above mentioned isoforms , an alternate transcriptional start site located at intron 9 of AIF originates a short variant of the protein AIFsh that lacks the N-terminal MLS and the redox-active domain , yet retains the nuclear localization sequence NLS . The transfection-enforced overexpression of AIFsh results in a nuclear protein that causes apoptosis.24 More-over , another short form of AIF , AIFsh2 , results from the alternative utilization of exon 9b instead of 9 , which contains a stop codon . AIFsh2 is a truncated protein that lacks the C-terminal pro-apoptotic domain , yet conserves its mitochon-drial localization and redox function.25 Both short AIF isoforms appear to be low-abundant in normal tissues because they have not been detected by immunoblot , with the exception of AIFsh2 that reportedly is present in the liver extracts.24,25 By characterizing the tissue expression profile of AIF isoforms , we discovered that AIF2 is specifically expressed in the CNS . Driven by the pathophysiological effect of AIF in neurodegeneration , 9,11,12 we performed an exhaustive func-tional and biochemical characterization of the AIF2 isoform and importantly , we found that , compared with AIF1 , AIF2 possess a stronger anchoring capacity to the inner mitochon-drial membrane . These results suggest that the neuron-specific AIF2 isoform has been �designed� for maintaining its mitochondrial functions yet reducing its pro-apoptotic activities . Results and Discussion A novel brain-specific isoform of AIF , AIF2 . When sequencing several cDNAs from fetal human brain , we detected an alternative exon 2 usage Figure 1a , indicating that the precursor of the human AIF mRNA can be alternatively spliced , yielding two isoforms that we designated AIF1 when exon 2a is used and AIF2 when exon 2b is used . The alternative exons 2a and 2b are phylogenetically conserved among mammals . Similarly , the two exons were generated by gene duplication well before the speciation of mammals data not shown . Indeed , we were able to trace the duplication event to chicken genome , in which a region homologous to the mammalian exon 2a can be found 50 of exon 2b on chromosome 4 , although the splice acceptor site of exon 2a seems to be non-canonical UCSC , genome browser . Thus , both exons 2a and 2b are detectable in published cDNA sequences from primates , rodents and other mammals such as Equus caballus and Canis familiaris NCBI-Homologen database , whereas only one exon 2 , which resembled exon 2b from mammals , could be discerned in chicken cDNA libraries Figures 1b and c . Amino acid alignments of exons 2a and 2b from several animal species revealed two positively charged and one negatively charged common residues , as well as conserved motifs with hydrophobic stretches Figure 1c . However , secondary structure predictions indicate the consequences of variable residues and their differential properties on the potential secondary structure of the segment encoded by each of the two exons Figure 1d . Quantitative expression profiling of the two AIF isoforms have shown that AIF2 mRNA was specifically detected in human brain , yet was absent from most other analyzed tissues except the retina Figure 2a . Within the human adult brain , AIF2 mRNA was found in all regions , including the cortex or in subcortical areas , and the expression level of AIF1 and AIF2 mRNAs were similar Figure 2b . This general expression profile was similar for all examined mouse tissues , in which AIF2 mRNA was again restricted to the brain Figure 2c . Both in human and mice , low levels of AIF expression were detected in the brain compared with other organs . This probably reflects the comparative paucity of mitochondria in the brain , because the ratio of AIF protein and the most abundant outer mitochondrial membrane protein , VDAC , is similar in a panel of distinct mouse organs including brain.14 The expression levels of AIF1-and AIF2-specific mRNAs were equivalent in the adult mouse brain and were similarly affected by the hypomorphic Hq mutation that reduced the expression of both AIF1 and AIF2 to around 20 % of the control level Figure 2d . It is noteworthy that the expression of human AIF2 mRNA was higher in adult brain than in fetal brain while that of AIF1 was lower Figure 2b , indicating that the AIF1 AIF2 ratio decreases as brain cells differentiate . Accordingly , mouse embryonic telencephalic cells immortalized with thermosensitive SV40 large T antigen tsA58 LT-Ag Figures 3a and b , or human embryonic mesencephalic cells immortalized with a v-Myc retroviral vector Figure 3c could be stimulated to express higher AIF2 levels on in vitro differentiation . Thus , AIF2 is specifically and differentially expressed in brain cells , depending on their maturation status . Next , we determined the relative AIF1 and AIF2 mRNA expression in the NCI National Cancer Institute panel of cancer cell lines NCI60 . Although AIF1 was expressed by all cells , independently of their tissue origin , AIF2 was absent from all samples Supplementary Figure 1 , including from brain cancer cell lines , of glial origin , contained in the NCI AIF gene AIF1 AIF2 AIF gene panel Figure 4a . However , AIF2 was expressed by a fraction of neuroblastomas Figures 4a and b , in line with the data obtained on normal , untransformed tissues see above , Figure 2 . In conclusion , AIF2 is specific for neuronal tissues and neuroblastomas . Cellular and subcellular localization of AIF2 . Comparative in situ hybridizations of the adult mouse brain with isoform-specific probes revealed a similar macroscopic distribution of AIF1 and AIF2 mRNAs , with peak intensities in the olfactory bulb , rostral migratory stream , olfactory cortex and pituitary Figures 5a�f , negative controls with anti-sense probes are shown in Supplementary Figure 2 . To analyze whether both AIF isoforms are expressed in the same cells , we performed a simultaneous fluorescent in situ hybridization FISH with differentially labeled exon 2a-and 2b-specific probes red and green , respectively . In most brain regions , AIF1 and AIF2 were co-expressed by the same cells . However , approximately 25 % of the cells present in the anterior olfactory nucleus stained uniquely for the exon 2b-specific probe , indicating the existence of brain cells that solely express AIF2 and not AIF1 Figures 5g�i . AIF1 and AIF2 share an identical N-terminal MLS , while their exon 2-encoded inner membrane sorting signals IMSS differ Figure 1 . To analyze whether this difference might affect the mitochondrial localization of AIF2 , we compared the subcellular distribution of AIF1 and AIF2 by transfecting Hela cells with Flag-tagged versions of AIF1 or AIF2 with the Flag fused to the C-terminus . When transfected cells were fixed and permeabilized with paraformaldehyde plus Triton X100 and stained with a Flag-specific antibody Figure 6a , we found both proteins similarly redistributed into mitochondria plasmid 20000 quantitation 15000 Brain Liver Heart Kidney Spleen Colon Retina Blood Prostate reference 3000 brain Brain lobe lobe lobe lobe Cortex Insula Pons nucleus Gyrus Gyrus callosum Putamen accumbens oblongata Hippocampus Fetal Parietal Occipital Frontal Temporal Adult Cerebral Paracentral Postcentral Caudate Corpus Medulla Nucleus Brain Liver Heart -WT -Hq Kidney Spleen Muscle Figure 2 AIF2 mRNA expression is restricted to the brain . Quantitative expression analyses of AIF1 and AIF2 mRNAs in various human a and murine c organs or in various human brain sub-regions b were performed . AIF1 and AIF2 mRNA expression was compared between brains of wild-type wt and hypomorphic Harlequin Hq mutant mice d . Data obtained for human samples a , b correspond to three independent quantifications mean�S.D. and for mouse organs c , d represent means�S.D. from at least three independent experiments . Relative quantification of AIF1 and AIF2 mRNA expression levels in human samples a , b was achieved by standard curve method using an AIF1 AIF2 reference plasmid . For murine RNA samples , relative fold variation of AIF1 and AIF2 were calculated using the comparative Ct method which were labeled with a matrix-targeted fluorescent protein , dsRed-mito , with no discernible effects on the overall shape of the mitochondrial network . Differential permeabiliza-tion of the outer mitochondrial membrane with 0.4 mg ml digitonin and the inner membrane with 0.8 mg ml digitonin allowed antibodies specific for Tim23 an inner membrane-anchored protein and cyclophilin D a soluble matrix protein , respectively , to access mitochondria Figure 6b . In these conditions , a Flag-specific antibody gained access to AIF1 and AIF2 similarly , as soon as the outer mitochondrial membrane was permeabilized Figures 6b and c , in concor-dance with the notion that both proteins expose their flagged C-termini to the intermembrane space . AIF-deficient cells show reduced abundance of complex I subunits , resulting in a severe respiratory dysfunction.8 Accordingly , small interfering RNAs specific for exon 2a or the 30UTR of AIF led to a marked reduction in the expression of the 20 kDa complex I subunit CI SU20 Figure 6d and other complex I subunits not shown in U2OS cells which only express AIF1 . The transfection of AIF2 whose expres-sion is not impeded by either of the two siRNAs blunted the depletion of CI SU20 induced by AIF1 knockdown , as much as did the transfection of AIF1 whose overexpression is abolished by the exon 2a-specific siRNA , yet not affected by the 30UTR-specific siRNA Figure 6d . These results corro-borate the hypothesis that both AIF isoforms are localized in the same submitochondrial compartment in which they both sustain the biogenesis or stability of complex I from the respiratory chain . It should be noted that the respiratory and redox functions of AIF are closely linked because redox-deficient AIF mutants are unable to restore the abundance and function of respiratory chain complex I from AIF knockout cell.26 Therefore , it appears plausible that AIF2 has a normal redox function , similar to that of AIF1 . Recently , Churbanova et al.27 reported a rather low NAD P H oxidase activity for a recombinant AIF protein that resembles endogenous AIF more closely than a His-tagged , truncated protein that had been analyzed earlier.7 In line with this possibility , we found that the siRNA-mediated depletion of AIF1 and or AIF2 from SHSY-5Y neuroblastoma cells which express both AIF1 and AIF2 did not affect cellular NAD P H levels Supplementary Figure 3 . Biochemical differences between AIF1 and AIF2 . To detect further possible differences between AIF1 and AIF2 , we stably transfected the Flag-tagged versions of both proteins in U2OS cells , obtaining supraphysiological levels of AIF1 and AIF2 Supplementary Figure 4a . Both Flag-tagged AIF1 and AIF2 cDNAs led to the expression of proteins with a similar electrophoretic mobility corresponding to B65 kDa Supplementary Figure 4a , and similar co-migration results were obtained for non-tagged versions of AIF1 and AIF2 not shown . The overexpression of AIF1 or AIF2 had neither deleterious effect on the proliferation rate not shown , nor affected the respiratory capacity and control of the cells Supplementary Figure 4b . However , both AIF isoforms differentially affected the ultrastructure of mitocho-ndria , as detectable by transmission electron microscopy TEM . AIF1 but not AIF2 overexpression lead to a rare-faction of cristae , while AIF2 but not AIF1 overexpression tended to increase the curvature of cristae , which frequently adopted an onion-like shape Supplementary Figure 4c . Although this result was obtained in conditions in which the two AIF isoforms were overexpressed , it suggested subtle differences in the effect of the insertion of their putative transmembrane domains on mitochondrial membrane structure . Driven by these results , we analyzed whether AIF1 and AIF2 actually differ in their membrane anchorage , in condi-tions in which Flag-tagged AIF1 and AIF2 are expressed at physiological levels lower than endogenous AIF , Figures 7a and b . AIF1 versus AIF2-expressing cells were exposed to increasing concentrations of the non-ionic detergent Igepal CA-630 , and the extractability of the two AIF isoforms was measured . While Igepal CA-630 efficiently extracted AIF1 from mitochondria , AIF2 was largely resistant to the detergent and remained bound to the ultracentrifugable pellet . Thus , AIF2 behaves like the inner membrane-anchored CI SU20 , while AIF1 behaved like several soluble mitochondrial proteins including cytochrome c Figure 7a . When , the Igepal CA-630 extraction protocol was replaced by a different one involving sodium carbonate , Flag-tagged AIF1 was again released in conditions of basic pH pH ? 10.5 , whereas Flag-tagged AIF2 remained attached to the membrane fraction Figure 7b . Importantly , in these conditions , endogenous AIF1 the sole isoform of AIF expressed in HeLa cells behaved like Flag-tagged AIF1 , indicating that membrane-anchoring properties of the recombinant AIF was not affected by the Flag tag Figure 7b . Next , we assessed the effect of the alkylating agent MNNG on the release of AIF1 versus AIF2 . Again , it appeared that Flag-tagged AIF1 was readily released into the cytosol of MNNG-treated cells , while Flag-tagged AIF2 remained attached to mitochondria Figure 7c . In these conditions , endogenous AIF1 co-translocated to the cytosol in the presence of Flag-tagged AIF1 . However , endogenous AIF1 was withheld from the cytosol in the presence of Flag-tagged AIF2 Figure 7c . We conclude that AIF2 is more difficult to be released from mitochondria than AIF1 . This difference can not be explained by the consensus sequence of the cleavage site by calpains and cathepsins , which is the same for both proteins . Rather , the differential release of AIF1 and AIF2 must be linked to other properties of the molecules such as the accessibility of AIF2 to proteases . Thus , the N-terminus of AIF2 might be more profoundly �buried� in the lipid bilayer of the inner mitochondrial membrane than that of AIF1 . In support of this possibility , biochemical studies of AIF1 carried out by Churbanova et al.27 suggest that redox-regulated changes in the conformation of AIF that implicate its N-terminal and C-terminal segments might dictate AIF�s accessibility to apoptotic proteases and regulate its mitochondrial release in dying cells . In this context , the dimerization of AIF molecules has also been suggested.27,28 Indeed , endogenous AIF1 could be detected in the anti-Flag immunoprecipitate of Flag-tagged AIF1 or AIF2 Figure 7d . Thus , the two AIF isoforms can form homo-or heterodimers or higher-order oligomers . Accordingly , we hypothesize that the inhibitory effect of AIF2 on AIF1 release might be explained by a physical interaction reference 30000 mRNA 20000 to Relative compared 10000 IMR32 A172 SHSY5Y SK-N-AS SF-268 SF-295 SF-539 U251 SNB-19 SNB-75 reference 3000 Relative compared 1000 Figure 4 AIF1 and AIF2 mRNA expression profile in cancer cells .

Means�S.D. are obtained from two independent experiments between the two isoforms that makes the mitochondrial release-associated cleavage of AIF1 more difficult to be achieved when AIF2 is present . Concluding remarks . In this paper , we comparatively analyze two AIF isoforms that solely differ in the utilization of one exon exon 2 that code for a portion of the AIF N-terminus . Both AIF isoforms , AIF1 and AIF2 , are associated with the inner mitochondrial membrane and are similar in their capacity to sustain a normal function of the respiratory chain . Importantly , it appears that the IMSS of AIF1 IMSS-AIF1 , which is encoded by exon 2a , is cleaved during the import of the AIF precursor into mitochondria , in a highly conserved peptide motif , after residue 54 in humans AIF1 or residue 53 in mouse AIF .6,29 This implies that only 29 amino acids of the C-terminal half of IMSS-AIF1 are present in the mature mitochondrial AIF1 protein . Importantly , mature mitochondrial AIF2 as present in brain tissues or obtained by transfection with a cDNA showed exactly the same electrophoretic mobility as AIF1 , suggesting that AIF2 is trimmed during mitochondrial import by a peptidase that cleaves within the exon 2b-encoded IMSS-AIF2 as well . As a result , the N-terminus of AIF1 and AIF2 are dissimilar in their primary sequence as well as in their hydrophobicity , explaining the relatively loose association of AIF1 which bears a less hydrophobic N-terminus than AIF2 with the inner mitochondrial membrane . Consequently , AIF2 is more difficult to dissociate from mitochondrial membranes , irrespective of the nature of the desorbing agent non-ionic detergents , basic pH or MNNG stimuli , suggesting that AIF2 contributes less efficiently to apoptosis than AIF1 . AIF2 was solely expressed in the developing and adult CNS , as well as in the retina which contains neurons and , in developmental and anatomical terms , is a CNS derivative . Similarly , AIF2 was present in neuroblastomas but not in any other kind of tumor derived from non-neuronal tissues . Although all CNS cells that express AIF1 also contain AIF2 , some cells whose exact nature remains to be identified are positive for AIF2 but not for AIF1 . What might be the �purpose� of CNS-restricted expression of AIF2 in teleological terms ? AIF1 and AIF2 share their vital functions with regard to mitochondrial respiration , while AIF2 is more tightly bound to mitochondrial membranes and hence less likely to mediate cell death which requires the mitochondrial release and nuclear translocation of AIF . If this hypothesis was correct , the utilization of exon 2b which gives rise to AIF2 might constitute a strategy to avoid AIF-dependent neurotoxicity . As AIF1 and AIF2 can interact with each other and as AIF2 can withhold AIF1 in mitochondria , the putative neuroprotective function of AIF2 would extend to those cells that express both AIF1 and AIF2 . For testing this hypothesis , exon 2b-specific knockouts should be generated and evaluated for their putative neurotoxicity alone or upon neuronal injury . As a caveat , it must be mentioned that the expression level of AIF has a profound effect on neuronal differentiation.12 Therefore , it remains formally possible that AIF2 but not AIF1 is intimately linked to CNS development and that the exon 2b-specific knockout will cause major brain defects . These intriguing hypotheses will be studied in the future . Materials and Methods Antibodies .

20150912	www.nature.com cdd Excessive mechanical loading of cartilage producing hydro-static stress , tensile strain and fluid flow1 results in irreversible cartilage erosion , chondrocyte apoptosis and osteoarthritic OA disease.2 Numerous in vitro studies support the notion that low fluid shear o10 dyn cm2 is chondroprotective , 3 whereas high shear 410 dyn cm2 promotes matrix degra-dation3 and chondrocyte apoptosis.4,5 We have shown that high fluid shear induces cyclooxygenase-2 COX-2 expres-sion , 4,6,7 which suppresses the antioxidant capacity of sheared chondrocytes and contributes to their apoptosis.4 Indeed , aberrant expression of COX-2 protein in articular cartilage is an earmark of arthritis8 associated with increased numbers of apoptotic chondrocytes.9,10 COX-2 catalyzes the rate-limiting step of prostaglandin PG synthesis . PGE2 and PGD2 are the major PGs synthesized by chondrocytes . PGD2 readily undergoes dehydration to yield the bioactive cyclopentenone-type PGs of the J2-series , such as 15-deoxy-D12,14-PGJ2 15d-PGJ2 . However , their role in the metabolism of articular cartilage is still a matter of debate . Although some studies have suggested possible anabolic effects associated with low concentrations of PGE2,11,12 several others suggest that PGE2 has a major role in cartilage erosion and inflammation associated with arthritic disorders.8,13 Miwa et al.14 reported that PGE2 directly induces apoptosis in bovine articular chondrocytes through a cAMP-dependent pathway . In contrast , PGE2 by itself can not elicit apoptosis in human chondrocytes , even though a COX-2 specific inhibitor , NS398 , represses nitric oxide-induced chondrocyte apopto-sis , 9 suggesting the potential involvement of other COX-2-derived PGs in this process . Prostaglandin D synthase PGDS , responsible for the biosynthesis of PGD2 and J2-series , exists in two isoforms hematopoietic H -type and lipocalin L -type PGDS . L-PGDS is the predominant isoform in human cartilage and is markedly upregulated in OA relative to healthy cartilage.15 PGD2 is released by cytokine-activated human chondrocytes.15 Its metabolite 15d-PGJ2 is also secreted by human articular chondrocytes and detected in joint synovial fluids obtained from OA or rheumatoid arthritis patients.16 15d-PGJ2 has been reported to induce chondrocyte apoptosis in a dose-and time-dependent manner through a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-g PPAR-g -dependent pathway.16 Although 15d-PGJ2 has also been shown to have a pro-apoptotic effect on other cell types , such as endothelial cells , 17 tumor cells18 and neurons , 19 several lines of evidence suggest that it may have chondroprotective effects . For instance , 15d-PGJ2 and PGD2 counteract the induction of matrix metalloprotei-nases in cytokine-activated chondrocytes , 20,21 which have a key role in cartilage degradation . 15d-PGJ2 also blocks apoptosis of human primary chondrocytes induced by the NF-kB inhibitor Bay 11-7085.17 Taken together , the contribu-tions of PGE2 , PGD2 and its metabolite 15d-PGJ2 to chondrocyte apoptosis remain controversial . The signaling pathway by which COX-2 elicits chondrocyte apoptosis in response to high fluid shear4 has yet to be delineated . Moreover , the contradictory data in the literature regarding the potential roles of PGE2 and PGD2 15d-PGJ2 in chondrocyte apoptosis prompted us to analyze which COX-2-derived PG is involved in this process . In this study , we show that COX-2-derived PGD2 and its metabolite 15d-PGJ2 , but not PGE2 , mediate shear-induced chondrocyte apoptosis . Using cDNA microarrays in conjunction with clustering algorithms , we propose a novel signaling pathway by which high fluid shear mediates COX-2 L-PGDS-dependent chon-drocyte apoptosis , which was validated by genetic interven-tions . We show that L-PGDS controls the downregulation of protein kinase A PKA , which in turn regulate Polo-like kinase 1 Plk1 and Plk3 . Plks target p53 , and control the transcription of p53 effectors TP53INPs , FAS and Bax , which are involved in chondrocyte apoptosis . Results Shear-induced PGD2 and its metabolite 15d-PGJ2 , but not PGE2 , mediate chondrocyte apoptosis . High fluid shear 410 dyn cm2 induces chondrocyte apoptosis , 4,5 which is markedly suppressed by COX-2-specific inhibitors.4 In this study , we aimed to delineate the mechanism s by which shear-induced COX-2 mediates chondrocyte death . The human T C-28a2 chondrocyte cell line was chosen as a model system , as T C-28a2 cells have been shown to behave much similar to primary human chondrocytes when cultured under appropriate conditions.22,23 As a first step , we evaluated the effect of exogenously added COX-2-derived prostaglandins on T C-28a2 chondrocytic cell viability using the 3-4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl -2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide assay . Our data reveal that PGD2 and its metabolite 15d-PGJ2 significantly reduce cell viability at concentrations of X20 mM and X3 mM , respectively Supplementary Figure 1A and B . In distinct contrast , the extent of T C-28a2 cell viability was not suppressed by PGE2 even at 40 mM Supplementary Figure 1C . We next established that exogenously added 15d-PGJ2 5 mM induces T C-28a2 chondrocyte apoptosis , as monitored by a caspase-3 colorimetric assay Figure 1a and annexin V-propidium iodide PI double staining Figure 2a . Taken together , these data suggest that COX-2-derived PGD2 and its nonenzymatic dehydration end product 15d-PGJ2 , but not PGE2 , might be involved in shear-mediated chondrocytic cell death . To validate this hypothesis , we first showed that exposure of T C-28a2 chondrocytes to high fluid shear 20 dyn cm2 induces sustained PGD2 and 15d-PGJ2 production relative to static untreated controls Supplementary Figures 2A and B . As PGDS is responsible for the biosynthesis of PGD2 and 15d-PGJ2 , and L-PGDS is predominantly expressed in human cartilage , 15 we aimed to delineate the role of this enzyme in shear-induced chondrocyte apoptosis . Our data reveal that high shear stress 20 dyn cm2 induces L-PGDS mRNA Table 1 and protein Figure 3 expression in human T C-28a2 chondrocytes . Knockdown of L-PGDS through RNA interference was shown at both the transcriptional Table 1 and translational Figure 3 levels , and was shown to block shear-induced chondrocyte apoptosis , as assessed by a caspase-3 colorimetric assay Figure 1b . In contrast , annexin FITC Table 1 Effects of COX-2-specific inhibitor NS398 and L-PGDS knockdown on mRNA Molecules of interest Shear controla L-PGDS 1.5�0.1 Bax 2.0�0.1 mean�S.D. nX3 transcript ratios in sheared chondrocytes , as assessed by real-time PCR transfection of T C-28a2 chondrocytes with control siRNA failed to impair shear-induced L-PGDS upregulation Figure 3 and the extent of shear-mediated apoptosis Figure 1b . Shear-induced chondrocyte apoptosis and its marked inhibition by L-PGDS knockdown were verified by annexin V-PI staining followed by flow cytometry Figure 2b . To further validate our observations that high fluid shear induces chondrocyte apoptosis , we examined the protein levels of cleaved caspase-8 and -9 in sheared and static control T C-28a2 chondrocytes . Figure 2c reveals that prolonged application of high shear stress 20 dyn cm2 48 h induces a marked upregulation of caspase-8 and -9 , which is reversed by L-PGDS knockdown . PGD2 exerts its effects primarily by binding and activating two plasma membrane receptors , the D prostanoid receptor DP 1 and DP2 . In view of previous observations showing that L-PGDS PKA-C ? ? Plk1 Plk3 Cdc25c ser216 Total Cdc25c p53 ser20 Total p53 ? -actin PGD2 mediates neuronal protection through the DP1 receptor , whereas activation of DP2 receptor promotes neuronal loss , 24 we analyzed the potential contribution of DP2 receptor to chondrocyte death . Use of the DP2 receptor antagonist BAY-u3405 5 mM failed to restore the diminished levels of 15d-PGJ2-mediated chondrocyte viability Supplementary Figure 3A and to inhibit shear-induced chondrocyte apoptosis data not shown , suggesting the lack of DP2 receptor involvement in chondrocyte death . The PGD2 metabolite 15d-PGJ2 is a natural ligand for PPAR-g , and has been reported to induce apoptosis in diverse cell types16,25�27 through PPAR-g-dependent or PPAR-g-independent mechanisms . 15d-PGJ2 is also an activator of the DP2 receptor.28 Use of the PPAR-g antagonist T0070907 1 mM , either alone or in combination with BAY-u3405 5 mM , failed to reverse the suppression of 15d-PGJ2-mediated chondrocyte viability Supplementary Figure 3A and to reduce shear-induced chondrocyte apop-tosis data not shown . Together , these data suggest that chondrocyte death in response to high shear stress proceeds through a PPAR-g-independent and DP2-indepen-dent pathway . The cytotoxic potential of 15d-PGJ2 has been linked to its ability to generate reactive oxygen species ROS , 19 which are a group of highly reactive molecular forms of oxygen containing unpaired electrons . Using the Image-iT LIVE Green Reactive Oxygen Species Detection dye Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA , USA , we report that exogenously added 15d-PGJ2 5 mM induces ROS production in human T C-28a2 chondrocytes , which is abrogated after T C-28a2 cell treat-ment with the antioxidant N-acetyl cycteine NAC 5 mM Figure 4a . Moreover , prolonged 48 h exposure of T C-28a2 cells to high shear stress 20 dyn cm2 results in ROS generation , which is abolished by L-PGDS knockdown Figure 4b . Collectively , these data reveal the key role of PGD2 and its metabolite 15d-PGJ2 in shear-induced ROS production and chondrocyte death . PGD2 and 15d-PGJ2 mediate shear-induced chondrocyte apoptosis through PKA-dependent regulation of Plks . By coupling the DNA microarray technology with bioinformatics tools , we aimed to elucidate the signaling pathway of shear-induced COX-2-dependent chondrocyte apoptosis . Differentially regulated genes between control and shear-activated T C-28a2 chondrocytes were identified by Significance Analysis of Microarray using the TMEV software Boston , MA , USA .4,6 Using an average linkage hierarchical clustering algorithm with a Euclidean distance metric , in which genes are iteratively grouped together based on their distance metric , we determined that COX-2 , Plk3 , FAS , TP53INP1 and TP53INP11 are contained within the same sub-tree structure Supplementary Figure 4 , thereby implicating co-regulation among these genes upon T C-28a2 cell exposure to fluid shear . Plks are known to participate in the DNA damage response , and transduce the damage signals to specific effectors including p53 and Cdc25.29 We therefore examined the roles of Plks , Cdc25 , p53 and other apoptosis-related genes FAS , TP53INPs and Bax in shear-induced T C-28a2 cell signaling . In view of our observations showing that high fluid shear 20 dyn cm2 induces PGE24 and cAMP Supplementary Figure 2C production , we also analyzed the role of PKA , a cAMP-dependent ser thr kinase , in shear-mediated chondrocyte apoptosis . As shown in Table 1 , application of high shear stress to T C-28a2 chondrocytes differentially regulates Plk1 and Plk3 , downregulates Cdc25 and upregulates the mRNA synthesis of apoptosis-related genes TP53INP1 , TP53INP11 , FAS and Bax . Even though application of high shear stress to T C-28a2 chondrocytes induces pronounced and sustained cAMP production relative to static controls Supplementary Figure 2C , the expression of PKA catalytic subunit , PKA-Ca , is markedly suppressed at both transcriptional Table 1 and translational Figure 3 levels at 48 h . Use of the COX-2-specific inhibitor , NS398 50 mM , or selective knockdown of L-PGDS through siRNA technology reversed the shear-induced downregulation of PKA-Ca Table 1 and Figure 3 , suggesting that the COX-2-derived PGD2 and its metabolite 15d-PGJ2 are responsible for the PKA-Ca regulation . Moreover , the aforementioned pharmacological and genetic interventions restored the shear-mediated changes in gene expression of Plk1 , Plk3 , Cdc25 and apoptosis-related genes Table 1 and Figure 3 . To delineate the role of PKA-Ca in the signaling cascade of shear-induced chondrocyte apoptosis , and in light of its marked downregulation in sheared chondrocytes , experi-ments were performed using T C-28a2 chondrocytes trans-fected with a plasmid containing the cDNA of PKA-Ca . The efficacy of this genetic intervention was shown at both transcriptional Table 2 and translational levels Figure 5a . Molecules of interest Control Ectopic expression of PKA-Ca abolished shear-induced chondrocyte apoptosis , as evidenced by a caspase-3 colori-metric assay Figure 1b and the blockade of shear-induced mRNA upregulation of pro-apoptotic genes FAS and TP53INP11 Table 2 . Interestingly , PKA-Ca overexpression reversed the shear-mediated changes in Plk1 and Plk3 expression Table 2 and Figure 5a without affecting COX-2 mRNA upregulation 4.6�1.6 in control cells versus 4.2�0.8 in cells overexpressing PKA-Ca . Inhibition of PKA activity using H89 2 mM further exacerbated the shear-induced mRNA changes of Plks and pro-apoptotic genes Table 2 . Taken together , these data suggest that PKA-Ca is down-stream of COX-2 , controls the regulation of Plk1 and Plk3 and has an anti-apoptotic effect . This conclusion is corroborated by our observations showing that exogenous 15d-PGJ2 5 mM downregulates PKA-Ca expression in T C-28a2 chondrocytes , whereas PKA-Ca overexpression reverses 15d-PGJ2-mediated changes in Plk1 and Plk3 expression at the mRNA Supplementary Table 1 and protein Figure 5b levels . Plk1 overexpression and Plk3 knockdown reverse shear-induced chondrocyte apoptosis . To elucidate the roles of Plk1 and Plk3 in the signaling pathway of shear-induced chondrocyte apoptosis , and in view of their differential regulation patterns in sheared chondrocytes , experiments were performed using T C-28a2 chondrocytes transfected with either a plasmid containing the cDNA of Plk1 or an siRNA oligonucleotide sequence specific for Plk3 . The efficacy of Plk1 overexpression and Plk3 knockdown was shown at both transcriptional Table 2 and translational levels Figure 6 . These genetic interventions abrogated shear-induced chondrocyte apoptosis Figure 1b , but failed to alter PKA-Ca mRNA and protein expression Table 2 and Figure 6 , thereby confirming that Plks are downstream of PKA-Ca . In light of previous observations showing that Cdc25c and p53 are directly targeted by Plks , 29 we analyzed the effects of high fluid shear and Plk modulation on p53 and Cdc25c regulation . Our data reveal that p53 transcription Table 1 and translation Figures 3 , 5 and 6 are not regulated in sheared chondrocytes . However , high shear stress increases p53 phosphorylation at ser20 , which is blocked by Plk1 overexpression Figure 6a and Plk3 knockdown Figure 6b . Similarly , L-PGDS knockdown Figure 3 and PKA-Ca over-expression Figure 5a restore shear-induced p53 phosphor-ylation to basal levels . All aforementioned genetic interventions were also effective in inhibiting the transcription of p53 effectors TP53INPs and FAS , which are involved in the apoptosis pathway Table 2 . Exposure of T C-28a2 chondrocytes to high fluid shear suppressed Cdc25c tran-scription Table 1 and translation Figures 3 , 5 and 6 , whereas it increased Cdc25c phosphorylation ser216 levels normalized to total Cdc25c protein Figures 3 , 5 and 6 . Similar observations were made in T C-28a2 chondrocytes activated with exogenous 15d-PGJ2 Supplementary Table 1 and Supplementary Figure 5 . These data are consistent with DNA damage-induced cell cycle arrest , which precedes apoptosis.29 Genetic modulation of Plks as well as of genes exerting an effect upstream of Plk1 and Plk3 negated the shear-induced decrease in Cdc25c transcription and transla-tion as well as the increase in Cdc25c phosphorylation Figures 3 , 5 and 6 . Taken together , our data reveal a novel signaling pathway by which high fluid shear mediates COX-2 L-PGDS-dependent chondrocytic cell cycle arrest and apop-tosis Figure 7 . Discussion Excessive mechanical loading can directly damage the articular cartilage , adversely affect chondrocyte function and precipitate OA.2,30 We have previously shown that application of high shear stress 20 dyn cm2 to human chondrocytes induces COX-2 expression , 4,6,7 which represses their anti-oxidant capacity and contributes to apoptosis.4 The pivotal role of COX-2 in shear-induced chondrocyte apoptosis and the conflicting data in the literature on the roles of PGE29,14 and PGD2 15d-PGJ215�17 in chondrocyte apoptosis prompted us to analyze which COX-2-derived PG is involved in this process . In this study we show that exogenously added PGD2 and 15d-PGJ2 , but not PGE2 , markedly diminish the viability of human T C-28a2 chondrocytes under static no shear conditions . Along these lines , exogenous 15d-PGJ2 induces T C-28a2 chondrocyte apoptosis , as assessed by a caspase 3 colorimetric assay and annexin V PI double staining . In agreement with these observations , knockdown of L-PGDS , which is predominantly responsible for biosynthesis of PGD2 and J2-series in human chondrocytes , abolishes shear-induced chondrocyte apoptosis . In contrast to a previous report showing that 15d-PGJ2 induces chondrocyte apoptosis through a PPAR-g-dependent pathway , 16 our data disclose that apoptosis of human T C-28a2 chondrocytes induced by either 15d-PGJ2 or high shear stress proceeds through a PPAR-g-independent and DP2-independent mechanism . Our findings are in concert with apoptosis data obtained using diverse cell types stimulated with exogenously added 15d - PGJ2.27,31 We and others26 have observed that the applied concentration of exogenous PGD2 and 15d-PGJ2 to induce apoptosis in different cell types exceeds that measured in cell culture supernatants . This discrepancy may be attributed to the enhanced efficiency of the endogenously released 15d-PGJ2 in stimulating apoptosis through an autocrine mechanism versus that of the commercial exogenously added compound . Previous work has suggested that the cytotoxic potential of 15d-PGJ2 is associated with its ability to generate ROS in diverse cell types , 19 presumably due to its a , b-unsaturated carbonyl moieties in the cyclopentanone ring . These moieties are also capable of reacting with thiol groups by Michael addition , thereby modifying the function of target proteins . Indeed , exogenously added 15d-PGJ2 induces ROS produc-tion in human T C-28a2 chondrocytes . Treatment of T C-28a2 chondrocytes with NAC inhibited in a dose-dependent manner the reduction of cell viability induced by 15d-PGJ2 , with maximalinhibitionobservedat5mM SupplementaryFigure3B . NAC 5 mM was also effective in inhibiting ROS production in 15d-PGJ2-stimulated T C-28a2 cells . We have also found that prolonged application of high shear stress induces ROS generation in human T C-28a2 chondrocytes . Although we were not able to test the effect of NAC 5 mM treatment on shear-induced chondrocyte apoptosis and ROS accumulation due to cell detachment from glass slides during the shearing assay , we have reported that the decreased shear-induced antioxidant capacity of chondrocytes contributes to their apoptosis.4 This and other studies have also shown that elevated mechanical stress , including shear stress , releases ROS from chondrocytes , 30,32 and that antioxidants repress stress-induced cell death.4,30 Taken together , these findings reveal that oxidative stress mediates the damaging effects of fluid and mechanical shear stress on chondrocytes . Plks are known to have a pivotal role in the DNA damage response and apoptosis.29 By coupling the DNA microarray technology with clustering algorithms , we determined that COX-2 , Plk3 and p53 effectors , including TP53INP1 , TP53INP11 and FAS , are co-regulated in shear-activated T C-28a2 chondrocytes . Using molecular interventions , we showed for the first time that high fluid shear differentially regulates Plk1 and Plk3 expression in a COX-2 L-PGDS-dependent manner in sheared chondrocytes , which are in turn responsible for the transcriptional and translational down-regulation of Cdc25c and the increased phosphorylation of p53 . p53 regulation can be mediated through different mechanisms such as de novo transcription , increased translation of p53 mRNA , p53 protein stabilization or covalent protein modification . Previous work has shown that p53 protein expression is upregulated in shear-stimulated bovine aortic endothelial cells , 33 in smooth muscle cells stimulated with cyclic strain34 and in human chondrocyte explants subjected to elevated mechanical stress.30 However , our data reveal that high fluid shear does not alter p53 expression at the transcriptional or translational level . Instead , the accumulation of active p53 in response to high shear stress occurs through a post-translational mechanism , as evidenced by increased p53 phosphorylation ser20 levels . p53 phospho-rylation is blocked by overexpressing Plk1 or knocking down Plk3 . These findings are in accord with previous studies showing that Plk3 interacts and phosphorylates p53 in hydrogen peroxide-stimulated human fibroblasts , 35 whereas Plk1 negatively affects the pro-apoptotic function of p53 in human tumor cell lines.29 We have previously shown that shear-induced chondrocyte apoptosis is characterized by cell shrinkage , membrane blebbing , DNA fragmentation , mitochondrial depolarization and caspase-9 activation , 4 thereby suggesting that it proceeds through the intrinsic apoptotic pathway . p53 is known to have a key role in mitochondrial membrane stability and regulation of apoptosis-related proteins.36 Our data , in conjunction with previously published results , 36 suggest that p53 activation , as evidenced by increased p53 phosphoryla-tion levels in sheared chondrocytes , is responsible for the transactivation of Bax , disruption of mitochondrial integrity , and apoptosis through the intrinsic pathway . Apoptosis can also be initiated by death receptor ligation such as FAS�FAS ligand . Our results reveal that high shear stress also upregulates the mRNA synthesis of FAS in human T C-28a2 chondrocytes . In view of previous observations identifying FAS as a primary target gene regulated by p53,37 our data suggest that shear-induced apoptosis can also proceed through the p53-mediated death receptor pathway . This is corroborated by our observations showing that high shear stress activates caspase-8 , which is blocked by PGDS knockdown . Exogenous 15d-PGJ2 activates caspase-9 and -8 , thereby illustrating the involvement of both the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways in the apoptosis of human T C-28a2 chondrocytes . Moreover , use of the pan caspase inhibitor z-VAD-FMK 25 mM partially inhibited the extent of 15d-PGJ2-mediated chondrocyte death . In light of our results showing that high fluid shear induces PGE2 and cAMP production , we also analyzed the contribu-tion of PKA-Ca , a cAMP-dependent ser thr kinase , to shear-mediated chondrocyte apoptosis . Previous studies have presented conflicting data regarding the involvement of cAMP PKA in chondrocyte function . Specifically , Miwa et al.14 reported that PGE2 directly induces apoptosis in bovine articular chondrocytes through a cAMP-dependent pathway . In contrast , Karsdal et al.38 reported that increased cAMP levels in mouse chondrocytes inhibited cytokine-induced MMP expression and activity , and blocked cartilage degradation . Our data reveal that high shear stress induces a pronounced and sustained release of cAMP . Although PKA-Ca transcriptional activity is upregulated in sheared chondro-cytes at short 1�2 h shear exposure times data not shown , prolonged 48 h exposure of T C-28a2 cells to high fluid shear markedly downregulates PKA-Ca mRNA synthesis and protein expression . As PKA-Ca downregulation is reversed by L-PGDS knockdown , we hypothesize that PGD2 and its nonenzymatic dehydration end product 15d-PGJ2 are involved in this process , presumably through the generation of ROS . Our results disclose that ectopic expression of PKA-Ca effectively blocks shear-induced chondrocyte apoptosis , thereby suggesting that PKA-Ca confers protection to chondrocyte apoptosis in response to shear stress . In accord with these observations , inhibition of PKA-Ca using H89 or use of the cAMP inhibitor SQ22536 data not shown exacerbates the extent of shear-induced apoptosis . Using molecular interventions , we showed for the first time that PKA-Ca , which is downstream of L-PGDS , controls the differential regulation of Plk1 and Plk3 Figure 7 . Plk1 and Plk3 regulate in turn p53 activation and Cdc25c transcription , translation and phosphorylation Figure 7 . p53 may be directly responsible for shear-induced Cdc25c transcriptional and translational regulation , in light of previous findings revealing the presence of a p53 binding site in the Cdc25c promoter , which confers p53-dependent repression.39 Thus , p53 seems to promote shear-induced chondrocyte apoptosis through chondrocytic cell cycle arrest and activation of both the extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways . Reconstructing the signaling pathways regulating cartilage degradation and chondrocyte apoptosis in response to high shear stress may identify potential therapeutic targets for controlling arthritic pathogenesis and or progression and may be useful in the design of bioreactors for cartilage tissue engineering applications .

20150914	Mammalian heat shock transcription factor-1 HSF-1 exists constitutively as a non-DNA-binding cytosolic monomer that when activated by heat stress , forms active homotrimers that translocate to the nucleus and associate with consensus-binding sites within the promoters of its target genes.1�3 These heat shock elements HSEs are characterized by concatenation of a minimum of three inverted pentameric repeats , nGAAn , to form the 15-bp idealized HSE motif nGAAnnTTCnnGAAn.4,5 HSF-1 binding to these elements is cooperative at two levels � both within the subunits of the HSF-1 trimer and between multimers such that the binding of HSF-1 to one binding site facilitates its binding to an adjacent site.5�7 Therefore , the overall composition of HSEs , including the number of binding sites , fidelity to consensus , nature of the flanking sequence , orientation and spacing of consensus pentamers governs the affinity of HSF-1 for these binding regions and the relative inducibility of the target gene . Fever is a highly conserved physiological response that is mediated largely by the pyrogenic activities of TNF-a , IL-1b and IL-6.8 The precise physiological function of the fever response is unclear , although it seems to enhance the capacity of the host defense system as evidenced by hyperthermia-induced enhancement of antigen processing , 9 dendritic cell maturation10 and pathogen clearance.11 The associated elevation in body temperature during infection has also been shown to impact on T cell proliferative capacity12 and significantly alter the secretion of a number of cytokines including TNF-a , IL-1b and IL-6.13 Interestingly , each of these cytokines is subject to transcriptional regulation by HSF-114�16 raising the interesting possibility that the elevation in tempera-ture associated with infection engages HSF-1 activity to help co-ordinate an appropriate immune response . Of note , the increase in temperature associated with fever 39�40 1C is sufficient to activate endogenous HSF-1 in primary T cells , but not other tissue types.17 The clonal expansion of an activated T cell population is halted by the engagement of apoptotic cell death to restore normal cell number and to maintain immune homeostasis . This phenomenon , known as activation-induced cell death AICD , is dependent on the transcriptional upregulation of Fas ligand FasL and interaction with its receptor , Fas , to activate caspase-8.18�20 The transcriptional regulation of FasL to alter cellular sensitivity to Fas-mediated apoptosis is also observed after stress imposed by DNA damage.21 One study also implicated hyperthermic stress in the transcrip-tional regulation of FasL in activated T cells to mediate enhanced cytotoxicity of Fas-bearing target cells.22 Elevated temperature can also impact on the Fas FasL signaling pathway through its suppression of FLIP levels23 and expression of a dominant active form of HSF-1 has been reported to elevate sensitivity to Fas-mediated killing , 24 but whether this reflects a simultaneous regulation of FasL levels is unclear . Furthermore , gld mice , lacking functional FasL exhibit a decreased sensitivity to heat shock-induced death.25 Collectively , these studies implicate elevated temperature in the regulation of the Fas FasL signaling pathway . It is , therefore , interesting to speculate whether this reflects a direct regulatory function for HSF-1 . We sought to test this possibility by examining whether HSF-1 is able to modulate the expression of FasL in activated T cells . We were able to define FasL as a novel target for the transcriptional activity of HSF-1 and characterize two consensus-binding sites or HSEs housed within the proximal region of the FasL promoter . We show that these two adjacent sites are independently able to bind HSF-1 and that they function in a cooperative manner to ensure optimal FasL promoter activity . These data present FasL as a novel target of HSF-1 transactivation activity and extend the classical function of this stress inducible transcrip-tion factor to include a fundamental function in the main-tenance and restoration of immune homeostasis . Results Earlier studies showed a function for Fas FasL interactions in heat shock-induced death25 and an induction of FasL in T cells following hyperthermic shock.22 However , whether this reflects a direct transcriptional function for HSF-1 at the level of the FasL promoter remains unknown . Heat shock potentiates the expression of FasL in activated T cells . To determine whether heat stress could induce FasL , Jurkat T cells were activated by PMA and ionomycin or plate bound anti-CD3 with or without soluble anti-CD28 before exposure to heat stress . PMA ionomycin Figure 1a or T cell receptor TCR -induced expression of FasL Figure 1b was potentiated in cells exposed to heat stress compared with heat stress alone . Similar observations were made using activated primary human peripheral blood lymphocytes PBLs Figure 1c . Importantly , heat-induced FasL expression seemed specific as pre-activation with either PMA and ionomycin Figure 1d or anti-CD3 Figure 1e failed to synergize with heat to further induce expression of heat shock protein 70 Hsp70 . In addition , neither the expression of TNF nor TRAIL was further elevated by heat in activated Jurkat T cells , further confirming the specificity of the effects we observed Figure 2 . Heat shock induces the expression of functional FasL in activated T cells to induce cell death in Fas ? target cells . To assess whether the induction of FasL gene expression could be detected as elevated expression of functional FasL protein , we evaluated cell surface expression of FasL in activated T cells exposed to heat shock as well as their ability to induce cell death of Fas ? target cells . Using antibody-specific staining , we observed a significant increase in both the percentage of Jurkat T cells expressing FasL and the amount of FasL staining per cell as determined by mean fluorescence intensity after exposure to elevated temperature 44 1C that was further increased by treatment with anti-CD3 CD28 Figure 3a . Heat-induced expression of FasL in activated Jurkat T cells was also reflected by their ability to induce significantly more cell death of Fas ? L1210 target cells compare bars denoted by * as compared with L1210 control cells compare bars denoted by # Figure 3b . Although activated Jurkat T cells were also able to induce some cell death in the target L1210 target population independently of elevated temperature marked by dotted line , the percentage of cell death was unchanged in the L1210-Fas cell line , suggesting that it was mediated in an FasL-independent manner . Collectively , the data shown in Figures 1�3 indicate that heat and TCR activation cooperate to optimally and specifi - cally induce FasL expression . We hypothesized that this may be mediated through the direct engagement of HSF-1 activity and conducted a series of experiments to test this . HSF-1 drives expression of the FasL promoter . To examine whether HSF-1 could drive expression of the FasL promoter , we transfected Jurkat T cells with luciferase reporter constructs containing 1.2,21 0.821 or 0.486 kb26 of the human FasL promoter with or without a plasmid expressing constitutively active HSF-1.1,24 HSF-1 induced the activity of each of the FasL promoter constructs Figure 4a�c in a dose-dependent manner Figure 4d . Moreover , HSF-1 greatly enhanced PMA ionomycin-induced activation of the 1.2 kb FasL promoter Figure 4e , consistent with our observation that hyperthermic shock of T cells activated by PMA and ionomycin pretreatment leads to the enhanced expression of endogenous FasL Figure 1a . Collectively , these data indicated that the proximal 0.5 kb of the FasL promoter contained one or more HSF-1 responsive elements that are important for heat-induced FasL transcription . HSEs in the FasL promoter compete HSF-1 binding from the Hsp70 promoter . To determine whether endogenously activated HSF-1 can directly interact with the proposed HSEs , we performed a series of electromobility shift analyses EMSAs , supershift analyses and competition studies using oligonucleotides from the Hsp70 promoter containing Human FasL promoter contains HSEs that bind HSF-1 . Visual analysis of the proximal 0.5 kb region of the FasL promoter revealed two likely HSEs HSE1 276 to 262 and HSE2 250 to 236 . HSF-1-binding parameters can tolerate a degree of flexibility from the consensus sequence , nGAAn , providing some key elements are maintained � these include a minimum of three inversely orientated pentamers , each of which maintain the �G� at position 2 . HSE1 contains three pentameric-binding motifs of which sites 1 and 2 preserve consensus , whereas the third , although imperfect , retains the essential G at position 2 . HSE2 also harbors two perfect pentamers , numbers 4 and 6 , and an imperfect binding motif 50-nGAGn-30 at position 5 Figure 5a . Using recombinant human HSF-1 , which spontaneously forms trimers in solution at concentrations in excess of 40 ng ml that are able to associate with DNA3 and an oligonucleotide encompassing the two putative HSEs from the FasL promoter or , for comparison , a 35-bp stretch from the human Hsp70 promoter , 27 we evaluated whether HSF-1 could bind to the FasL promoter . HSF-1 binding 4150 ng 25 nM to the oligonucleotides from both the FasL Figure 5b , lanes 6�15 and the Hsp70 promoters seemed similar Figure 5c , lanes 6�15 . previously defined HSEs27 and regions from the FasL promoter containing one or both the putative HSEs . Nuclear extract isolated from untreated or heat-shocked Jurkat T cells was incubated with an oligonucleotide from the proximal region of the Hsp70 promoter Figure 6 . As predicted , we observed a retardation of oligonucleotide mobility when incubated with extracts from heat-shocked cells lane 3 in each of Figure 6a�c , but not unstimulated control cells lane 2 in each of Figure 6a�c . This activity was supershifted with an anti-HSF-1 lanes 4 and 5 in each of Figure 6a�c , but not an anti-HSF-2 antibody lanes 6 and 7 in each of Figure 6a�c . The heat-inducible-binding activity was competed by unlabeled oligonucleotides containing both HSE1 and HSE2 from the FasL promoter Figure 6a , lanes 8�11 , but not by an oligonucleotide containing mutations in the essential bases in each of the six pentameric repeats Figure 6a , lanes 12�15 . Oligonucleotides containing either the HSE1 or HSE2 also competed for HSF-1-binding activity from the Hsp70 promoter region Figure 6b and c , lanes 8�11 , whereas mutant mt oligonucleotides containing mutations at the key residues required for HSF-1 binding did not Figure 6b and c , lanes 12�15 . Heat shock-induced binding activity to putative HSEs in the FasL promoter . To determine whether nuclear extracts isolated from heat-shocked cells contained an activity able to directly associate with specific regions within the FasL promoter , we conducted EMSAs using radiolabeled oligonucleotides containing both or each of the putative HSEs . A binding activity in nuclear extracts isolated from heat-shocked cells , but not unstimulated Jurkat cells , bound Activity Renilla 300000 strongly to the oligonucleotide containing both the HSE1 and HSE2 from the FasL promoter Figure 7a , compare lanes 2 and 3 and was supershifted by an anti-HSF-1 , but not an anti-HSF-2 antibody Figure 7 , lanes 4 and 5 , respectively . However , the mt counterpart of the 2 HSE oligonucleotide , containing mutations in each of the key bases , was not bound by nuclear extracts isolated from heat-shocked cells Figure 7a , lanes 8�10 . HSF-1 bound to oligonucleotides containing either HSE1 or HSE2 as observed by the retardation in nuclear extracts isolated from heat-shocked cells lane 3 in both Figure 8a and b , but not unstimulated cells lane 2 in both Figure 8a and b , and by supershift using an anti-HSF-1 lane 4 in both Figure 8a and b , but not anti-HSF-2 antibody lane 5 in both Figure 8a and b . Mutation of each of the three pentamers in HSE1 or those in HSE2 abolished binding of HSF-1 lanes 6�10 in both Figure 8a and b , respectively to the individual HSEs . It seemed that HSE1 Control 70000 HSF-1 Luciferase normalized 30000 20000 0.8kb FasLpr 0.486 kb FasLpr 200000 150000 activity Renilla to 100000 Luciferase normalized displayed a more efficient binding or greater affinity for HSF-1 than HSE2 compare lanes 1�5 with lanes 10�15 in both Figure 8a and b . To determine whether there was any cooperative binding between the two HSEs in the FasL promoter , we performed EMSA analysis comparing HSF-1 binding to the wild-type wt oligonucleotide harboring both HSEs to oligonulceotides containing mutations at each of the three key residues within either HSE1 or HSE2 . Surprisingly , we observed that mutation of each of the key residues within HSE2 of the 2 HSE probe did not seem to significantly affect HSF-1 binding Figure 7b , compare lanes 1�5 with 11�15 . However , when using an oligonucleotide containing mutations only within the HSE1 , we observed an almost complete abolition of HSF-1-binding activity Figure 7b , compare lanes 1�5 with 6�10 . These data strongly suggest that while both HSE1 and HSE2 can independently interact with HSF-1 , mutation of HSE1 in the context of the extended binding region severely compromises the ability of HSE2 to bind HSF-1 . In contrast , mutation of key residues within HSE2 in the context of the full HSF-1-binding region did not reduce the ability of HSE1 to bind to HSF-1 . HSF-1 binds to HSE1 and HSE2 in a cooperative manner . We then tested the idea that cooperative interaction between the two elements generates the most stable binding , and accordingly , confers greater inducibility of gene expression . Using surface plasmon resonance SPR , we were able to determine the binding constants of HSF-1 for the HSEs in the FasL promoter Figure 9 . We identified two components to the binding reaction between HSF-1 and the HSEs in both the Hsp70 and FasL promoters . The kinetic analysis and dissociation rate constants were determined according to a two state reaction conformational change model . The data obtained for each of the ligands Hsp70 , 2 HSE , HSE1 and HSE2 are shown in the sensorgrams in Figure 9a�d , respectively , and the calculated apparent affinity constant KD nM values in Figure 9e . The ka1 values for each of the ligands are almost identical , indicating that the initial binding reaction for HSF-1 is the same Figure 9e . However , significant differences in the dissociation constant kd1 for each of the oligonucleotides indicates a relatively unstable interaction between HSF-1 and HSE2 0.081 s 1 as compared with that between HSF-1 and either HSE1 0.033 s 1 or 2 HSE 0.032 s 1 . Interaction between HSF-1 and the Hsp70 promoter displayed the greatest stability 0.008 s 1 Figure 9e . The ka2 and kd2 values for both the Hsp70 promoter and the 2 HSE ligands indicate formation of a stable HSF-1 HSE complex with KD values of 2.75 and 14 nm , respectively . However , the interactions between HSF-1 and HSE1 or HSE2 show a reduced affinity and increased dissociation constants , suggesting that a reduced stabilization contributes to lower overall affinity KD values of 29 and 112 nM , respectively . HSF-1 induces the expression of the FasL promoter through distinct regions . To directly test whether the HSEs in the FasL promoter were relevant for driving gene expression , we cloned oligonucleotides containing three repeats of the region we suspected to harbor i both putative HSEs or ii each of HSE1 or HSE2 into constructs containing the minimal IL-2 promoter and a luciferase reporter.26 The promoter construct containing both HSE1 and HSE2 was most sensitive to the over-expression of HSF-1 and showed the greatest fold induction Figure 10a approximately 250-fold compared with HSE1 alone five-fold and the FasL promoter 12-fold Figure 10d . HSE2 failed to drive promoter activity Figure 10c . Comparable results were observed using Jurkat cells data not shown . We conclude that the FasL promoter contains consensus-binding elements for HSF-1 that are competent to drive FasL promoter expression , but that both HSE1 and HSE2 must be present to induce optimal activity . This is likely because of a functional co-operation between these two elements that is reflected in the differential-binding affinity of HSF-1 for the individual elements . The aberrant expression of FasL is implicated in autoimmune disease and the failure to induce the peripheral deletion of activated T cells to restore immune homeostasis after antigenic challenge.28,29 The physiological significance of the HSF-1-mediated regulation of FasL in the context of immune function is unclear and although HSF-1 null mice display several defects in immune regulation , 16,30 no studies have addressed the potential function of HSF-1 under conditions in which FasL is required for immune function . During the fever phase of infection , body temperature is raised as a consequence of increased levels of circulating pyrogenic cytokines and functions to help minimize the duration of infection and facilitate pathogen clearance.11 Elevated temperature can also regulate the secretion of several of the cytokines essential for survival from acute infection.13 Interestingly , the transcriptional activity of HSF-1 has been linked to the regulation of TNFa , 14 IL-1b15,31 and IL-616 expression , all of which are essential components of immune defense . Furthermore , Fas activation can inhibit heat-induced activation of HSF-1,32 suggesting a feedback loop between Fas FasL signaling events and regulation of events associated with elevation of body temperature during fever . TNF-a , the transcription of which is suppressed by HSF-1,14 is also able to inhibit heat-induced activation of HSF-1 through induction of phosphatases that presumably target HSF-1 to attenuate its activity.33 Although we do not understand the significance of HSF-1-mediated regulation of FasL expression , several scenarios emerge in which this regulatory loop could impact immune function . We showed that hyperthermia induced FasL expression that was more pronounced in both Jurkat T cells and primary human PBLs activated by PMA ion or anti-CD3 . This effect was restricted to FasL and was not observed with other members of the TNF superfamily , TRAIL and TNF . The enhanced expression of FasL gene expression in activated Jurkat T cells exposed to elevated temperature correlated with increased FasL protein expression that induced enhanced killing in Fas ? target cells . Similar observations by Cippitelli et al.22 describe a hyperthermia response element in the FasL promoter extending from 195 immediately 50 of the translational start site . We defined an HSF-1-binding region in the FasL promoter extending from 276 to 236 upstream of the translational start site that confers heat-inducible gene expression . Although Cippitelli et al.22 observed that heat stress cooperated with AP-1 and NF-kB to increase FasL reporter activity , we showed that HSF-1 drives the FasL promoter through a region devoid of either AP-1 or NF-kB-binding sites . Cippittelli et al.22 noted the necessity for the distal NFAT site26 in mediating the activity of HSF-1 on the FasL promoter notably , however , this site lies outside of their proposed region of hyperthermia sensitivity . Significantly , inactivation of this NFAT site would simultaneously mutate one of the HSF-1-binding sites within the HSE1 that we describe here . The region encompassing HSE1 was earlier identified as important for FasL expression in response to TCR signals and IL-2 stimulation.26 Therefore , it is a likely component of a complex regulatory region containing overlapping-binding sites for several transcription factors . We have not sought to determine how HSF-1 influences the avidity or affinity of additional transcription factor-binding sites , but it is interesting to speculate that the response of the FasL promoter to different signals may engage different combinations of transcription factors to generate stress-specific gene expres-sion . We have revealed a functional cooperation between HSF-1 induced through hyperthermia and TCR signals � whether this represents another transcription factor that is activated directly in response to TCR signals that functions in cooperation with HSF-1 or alternatively , whether signals that arise from TCR activation impact on HSF-1 function is currently unclear . We show that HSF-1 can bind in a cooperative manner to a defined region within the FasL promoter that correlates with upregulation of endogenous FasL gene expression . The cooperation between HSE1 and HSE2 could reflect a direct protein�protein interaction , whereby HSF bound to one of the elements facilitates the binding of additional HSF trimers . Alternatively , binding of HSF to its low affinity site may depend on altered DNA topology generated by occupation of the other site . Cooperation between two adjacent HSF-1-binding sites is optimal when separated by 10.5 bp , which corresponds to one turn of the DNA helix.34 The two HSEs in the FasL promoter are separated by 11 bp , which represents ideal spacing for optimal functional interaction based on a number of earlier studies examining the optimal periodicity for HSEs to sustain maximal transcription.5,6 FasL promoter constructs that contain either HSE1 or HSE2 show only a marginal inducibility in response to heat or to HSF-1 over-expression , whereas those containing both HSE1 and HSE2 show a much-enhanced response , indicative of cooperative binding and activation by HSF-1 . This pattern is consistent with the transcriptional regulation of heat shock genes.34 expression of a luciferase reporter . MCF-7 cells were transfected with one of the a , HSE1 b or HSE2 c from the FasL promoter together with an expression plus HSF-1 is shown d . After 24 h , cells were harvested and Firefly luciferase the average of triplicates from one representative experiment performed at least Our findings clearly show , for the first time , a direct association of HSF-1 with the FasL promoter and define two novel HSEs that function in a cooperative manner to optimally induce FasL promoter activity . This characterization is placed into a functional context by showing that hyperthermia elevates endogenous FasL expression in an HSF-1-depen-dent manner . These findings extend the function for the stress response beyond the regulation of Hsp gene expression to encompass the potential for HSF-1 as a regulator of immune function . Furthermore , the novelty of defining a hyperthermic response of the FasL promoter through a pathway involving HSF-1 bears particular significance in the context of the fever response . Elevated body temperature has been long recog-nized as an effector of optimal immune function , although the underlying mechanisms for this effect of hyperthermia remain somewhat elusive . The activation of HSF-1 at fever-like temperatures and its regulation of temperature-sensitive gene expression implicates HSF-1 as an important regulator of immune regulation and refines our understanding of how hyperthermia may modify immune function . The inclusion of FasL as an HSF-1 target extends the significance of HSF-1 in immune function and points to a potential function for the stress response in T cell function . FasL expression is a critical regulator of T cell survival in the context of peripheral deletion and is essential for the restoration and maintenance of immune homeostasis . Placement of HSF-1 in this pathway raises the notion that HSF-1 could have an essential function in the regulation of adaptive immunity . In addition , one of the HSF-1-binding elements we describe overlaps with an NF-AT site described earlier as crucial in the regulation of FasL after TCR activation . This raises the possibility that HSF-1 might modify NF-AT binding either positively in a manner analogous to the synergy observed with NF-AT and AP1 or negatively by direct competition to regulate FasL expression in response to TCR activation . In fact , signals emanating from TCR activa-tion including ROS can activate both FasL expression and HSF-1 � this potentially extends the function of HSF-1 in hyperthermia-induced FasL expression to encompass invol-vement in TCR signaling events to impact FasL expression and T cell function .

SPR BIAcore . Binding between HSF-1 StressGen Bioreagents and double stranded pre-annealed biotinylated oligonucleotides from the Hsp70 or FasL promoters was detected by SPR using a BIAcore X biosensor BIAcore , Piscataway , NJ , USA . Neutravidin Pierce , Rockford , IL , USA was dissolved in 10 mM Na-acetate pH5 and 3000RU was immobilized on the surface of CM4 sensorchips BIAcore , earlier activated by N-hydroxysuccinimide 0.05 mM and N-hydroxysuccinimide-N-ethyl-N�-diethylaminopropyl carbodiimide 0.2 mM . Free neutravidin was removed with three successive injections of 10 mM HCl 1 min at 100 ml min followed by blocking with 1M ethylenediamine pH8.5 to reduce non-specific electrostatic interactions . Approximately 30RU determined for each oligonucleotide using the Rmax equation BIAcore of each annealed biotinylated oligonucleotide pair was immobilized to the neutravidin . Experimental conditions were optimized to avoid non-specific binding of the analyte HSF-1 to the chip surface . The surface of the chip was blocked with multiple injections of biotin 7 min at 5 ml min and the selected running buffer 10 mM HEPES pH 7.4 , 150 mM NaCl , 3.4 mM EDTA , 0.005 % Tween 20 , 5 mg ml carboxylated dextran was applied at a flow rate of 20 ml min .

The apparent affinity constant KD is given by ka1 kd1 * 1 ? ka2 kd2 . The validity of using this model was confirmed by running a linked reactions test in which the analyte was injected at a high concentration that reached equilibrium 500 nM over the ligand surface with a short 1 min and a long contact time 5 min . For each ligand , the dissociation phase for the longer injection was slower than that for the short injection indicating that the binding events are linked data not shown .

20150916	The process of programmed cell death PCD is driven by a network of proteins connected to each other in an intricate manner . Over the past two decades , many of the network�s proteins nodes and the interactions among them edges mostly post-translation modifications have been identified . The PCD network is turned on by well-defined input signals , such as activation of death receptors or exposure to DNA damaging agents . The efficiency of its performance deter-mines the individual cell�s probability to die , which , when assessed over a large population of cells , can be translated into the percent of cell death . Dying cells can display several distinct cell death phenotypes , each driven by a different subset of proteins and molecular pathways . Examples are the caspase-dependent apoptotic cell death , autophagic cell death and programmed necrosis.1 Cells exposed to the same input signal can switch from one cell death modality to another in response to specific perturbations , 2�4 and in some cases , a mixed type of cell death can also be observed.5�7 This led us to propose here a working model , according to which the proteins that mediate the three different cell death phenotypes should be integrated within a common network , and the corresponding subsets of proteins should be considered as functional modules within this global network . To study the network as a whole , new strategies capable of analyzing the connectivity within and between the functional modules are required . Here , we developed a platform for dissecting the network�s architecture , which is based on single and double sets of RNAi-mediated perturbations . The uniqueness of this plat-form is that it combines three approaches to analyze the outcome of the perturbations including 1 The use of an unbiased quantitative reporter the luciferase gene to measure the extent of cell death and calculate the fitness values of the genetic interactions between seemingly un-related pairs of genes. 2 Assessing the perturbation effects on the molecular responses to the cell death agent , not only downstream to the knocked-down gene but also at distant functional modules . 3 Applying computational methods for the discovery of pathways mediating the newly identified genetic interactions by mining the protein�protein interaction PPI database . We applied this platform to cells that were exposed to the DNA damaging drug etoposide , targeting a few pairs of apoptotic and autophagic genes as a proof of concept . The initial running of this platform identified several levels of connectivity between apoptotic and autophagic proteins that either provide backup compensatory switches contributing to the robustness of the system or augment the final cell death performance through a novel non-canonical pathway . Results Designing the general outline of the platform . Our goal was to develop a platform that would assess the effects of single and double RNAi-mediated perturbations on both the final cell death performance , and the molecular responses to the death-inducing agent . Subsequently , the nature of epistatic interactions between seemingly unrelated pairs of genes is determined by this platform , and computational methods are applied to identify the pathway that connects these pairs of proteins see Figure 1 for scheme . The strategy is based on transient transfections with short hairpin RNAs shRNAs targeting genes from the different functional modules of the network 72 h before exposure to the death-inducing agent . HEK293 cells were chosen for this purpose because of their high sensitivity to different death-inducing agents , including etoposide see below , and their high transfection efficiency , which enables the knock down of two proteins simultaneously . Moreover , these cells can undergo different types of PCD.8�10 For assessing the responses of control non-perturbed cells , we used shRNA targeting HcRed Supplementary Figure S1 see also supplementary text . To exclude off-target effects , two different shRNA plasmids targeting the same gene were used . It is noted that all the individual shRNA plasmids used in this work had no effect on cell viability in non-treated cells , and therefore could be safely used for exclusively testing their possible effects on the cell death responses to the input signal . To choose the genes to be targeted by hypothesis-driven approaches , as opposed to random knock down , we constructed an initial connectivity map that served as our working model chart Supplementary Figure S2 . The map comprises a major part of the most studied apoptotic , autophagic and programmed necrotic proteins , organized into their canonical pathways , constituting three functional modules within the network . The proteins in the map which we defined in this work as the PCD set are linked by associations constructed manually on the basis of published knowledge see Supplementary Tables 1 and 2 for the list of proteins and edges , respectively . Establishing the cellular and the molecular readouts . The development of the cell death readout required a quantitative accurate assay that is capable of quantifying all forms of cell death . To this end , we developed a multi-well formatted luciferase assay using HEK293 cells engineered to stably express the luciferase gene . After exposure to a given cell death-inducing agent , surviving cells that express luciferase are quantified by enzymatic activity , with the distinct advantage that , unlike other readouts , this assay does not measure specific characteristics of only one type of cell death . Residual cell viability is calculated by dividing the values of treated by non-treated cells , and the resulting cell death values measured in transfectants carrying control shRNA are normalized to 100 % cell death performance . Assessing cell death by this assay was consistent with other more traditional and less accurate cell death assays , such as Trypan blue exclusion tests.11 It is noted that the luminescence values are linear over several orders of magnitude , providing a wide window of detection of viable cells between 102 and 105 cells Supplementary Figure S4a . Moreover , every point in each experiment is tested in 10 replicates , thus conferring a high degree of accuracy Supplementary Figure S4b the statistical analysis is detailed in Materials and Methods section . Thus , statistically significant small changes in cell death performance can be detected and quantified , an important advantage when considering the complexity of biological networks that tend to be robust and therefore relatively resistant to perturbations . These numeric data are then used to quantify the degree of epistasis between pairs of proteins , defining aggravating or alleviating types of interactions between seemingly unrelated genes in the network as detailed in Materials and Methods section . The second readout consists of testing the outcome of the perturbations on the molecular responses to the death-inducing agent , that is , measuring the status of interactions between the network�s nodes . This was based on western blotting using antibodies that recognize the relevant protein modifications in the pathway . It includes antibodies that recognize the cleaved substrates of caspases , including the processing activation of the initiator and executioner caspases , poly ADP ribosylation of proteins , and HMGB1 release into culture medium marked in asterisks in Figure 2 and shown in Figures 3 and 4 . Additional readouts that complement the western blotting assessments included cellular staining with molecular markers that reflect activation of specific pathways in the different modules , such as DAPI staining for tracing condensed fragmented nuclei , cytochrome c release from mitochondria or LC3 punctate staining in the cytosol , reflecting autophagic activity see Figures 3 and 4 and Supplementary Figure S5 . Computational approaches used for novel pathway discovery . The next stage in the platform involved the discovery of the molecular pathway s connecting pairs of proteins that display newly identified genetic interactions . To this end , a map of human PPIs was constructed B40 K interactions connecting B10 K proteins on the basis of interactions from the Human Protein Reference Database12 and from large-scale screens including yeast two hybrid13,14 and mass-spec analysis.15 We introduced into this large-scale map three important additions i Manually curated interactions between PCD proteins , which were missing from the public data sets see our initial connectivity map in Supplementary Figure S2 , and supplementary Table 2 for the full list of interactions between proteins in the PCD set . ii Adding edge directionality i.e. , identifying one protein as the source and the other as the target which is mostly missing in the available database . We manually determined the directionality of these edges on the basis of the literature , and if the directionality was not clear , it was assumed that the edge is bidirectional . iii Adding confidence values to nodes and edges . We assigned each interaction a confidence value based on the amount of supporting experimental evidence , using a logistic regression model adapted from Sharan et al.16 see supplementary information for the method used for adding the confidence values on the interactions between the proteins . The proteins in the network were also assigned a confidence level , reflecting their functional relatedness to proteins in the PCD set supplementary Table 1 . This functional relatedness was calculated on the basis of the gene ontology GO biological process annotations using semantic similarity17 see Materials and Methods section . Using the augmented network , the most reliable pathways i.e. , having the highest overall confidence connecting between a pair of proteins were identified as detailed in Materials and Methods section , and this was then followed by experimental validation . Single perturbation experiments � knocking down caspase3 reveals the existence of alternative caspase-independent mechanisms in the cell death network . Etoposide , a DNA-damaging drug , was chosen as the death-inducing agent in the current application of this platform . Phenotypic and molecular analysis indicated that a mixed type of necrotic and apoptotic cell death developed in the etoposide-treated HEK293 cells . Transmission electron microscopy TEM showed that the dying cells displayed hallmarks of programmed necrosis , including the appearance of empty vacuoles in the cytosol , and damaged mitochondria that were remodeled into separate matrix compartments Figure 3a . Cells incorporated Sytox Green into their DNA indicative of loss of membrane integrity between 24 to 48 hrs after etoposide treatment Supplementary movie . Consistent with this phenotype , molecular analysis indicated that etoposide induced PAR ribosylation of proteins and the release of HMGB1 from the cells into the culture media Figures 3b and c , two previously charac-terized hallmarks of programmed necrosis.4,18�20 In addition , the canonical apoptotic markers developed in response to the drug , including activation of the upstream initiator caspases2 and 9 , and of the executioner caspases3 and 7 and the cleavage of their two substrates , PARP-1 and ICAD Figure 3b and d . Also , fragmented nuclei and the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria to the cytosol were frequently detected Supplementary Figure S5 . Time curve analysis showed that PAR-ribosylation and caspase3 processing started to appear around 24 h after etoposide treatment , both peaking at 48 h Figure 3b . Subsequent RNAi-mediated perturbations were all assessed 48h after etoposide treatment , when the molecular responses were maximal . Knocking down caspase3 , a critical node of the apoptotic module Figures 2 , Supplementary Figure S2 , resulted in reduced cleavage of the downstream substrates PARP-1 and ICAD , confirming that the apoptotic module downstream to caspase3 was attenuated Figure 3d . Processing of caspase7 , but not of caspases9 and 2 , was also reduced , indicating a positive interaction between the two executioner caspases , and excluding positive feedback loops with the upstream initiator caspases in this setting Figure 3d . It is noted that the extent of etoposide-induced PAR ribosylation and HMGB1 release were also significantly attenuated by caspase3 knock down Figures 3c and d , consistent with TEM studies that showed a reduction in the necrotic hallmarks Figure 3a , panels 4 , 6 . In contrast , etoposide increased the appearance of autophagosomes in the caspase3 knocked-down cells Figure 3a , panels 8 , 9 . This was confirmed by scoring cells displaying punctate GFP-LC3 staining , a molecular marker for autophagosome formation.21 As shown in Figure 3e and quantified in Figure 4b , the frequency of cells in which the GFP-LC3 appeared in puncta increased significantly upon exposure of caspase3-depleted cells to etoposide , compared with the non-perturbed cells . Thus , although the knock down of caspase3 leads to the attenuation of the apoptotic and necrotic responses to etoposide , a switch to autophagy develops in parallel . Surprisingly , measurement of cell death performance by the luciferase assay indicated a complete lack of death protection by caspase3 knock down Figure 4a , Supplementary Figures S4b and S6a note that two different shRNAs were used . The lack of death protection by caspase3 knock down was also detected by the Trypan blue exclusion test Supplementary Figure S3 . It is noted that even when both caspases3 and 7 were knocked-down simultaneously , no protection from cell death could be detected Supplementary Figure S7 , thus excluding the possibility that the residual cleavage of down-stream proteins by caspase7 might be responsible for the lack of cell death inhibition observed in the caspase3 knocked-down cells . This prompted us to look at whether the switch to autophagy may have contributed to the observed caspase-independent cell death , a possibility that which was further investigated by the epistatic analysis below . Epistatic analysis � analyzing the genetic interactions between caspase3 and either Atg5 or Beclin-1 reveals additional levels of connectivity between the apoptotic and autophagic modules . To test whether the increased autophagy observed on caspase3 knock down signifies a switch toward the autophagic cell death module , two essential components of the basic autophagic machinery , Atg5 and Beclin-1 , were each knocked-down in combination with caspase3 . Beclin-1 is part of a Class III PI3K complex , which functions at the nucleation step upstream to Atg5 , which participates in membrane elongation of the growing autophagosome22 Figure 2 and Supplementary Figure S2 . The double perturbations were achieved by co-transfecting two shRNAs simultaneously . As shown in Figures 4c and d , the reduction of caspase3 , Atg5 and Beclin-1 was similar irrespective of whether these genes were knocked-down independently or in combination with a second shRNA . Scoring GFP-LC3 puncta indicated that either Atg5 or Beclin-1 knock down completely suppressed the etoposide-induced increase in autophagy detected in caspase3 per-turbed cells Figure 4b . Furthermore , although the single perturbation of Beclin-1 had no significant effect on cell death performance , the combination of Beclin-1 and caspase3 depletion significantly reduced cell death performance value to 87.5 % of its full capacity Figure 4a . The calculated double perturbation fitness23 indicated a negative deviation from multiplicativity e ? 0.109 see Materials and Methods section , that is , an aggravating type of interaction between Beclin-1 and caspase3 . The latter is consistent with a model in which Beclin-1 is part of a backup death-promoting module activated when caspase3 is knocked-down . Unlike Beclin-1 , the single perturbation of Atg5 displayed a small yet statistically significant reduction in cell death performance Figure 4a , and Supplementary Figure S4b for raw data . In addition , the combination of Atg5 and caspase3 knock downs reduced the cell death performance to 92 % of its full capacity , yielding a nonsignificant deviation e ? 0.03 from the neutral multiplicative model . Thus , although both Beclin-1 and Atg5 are rate limiting for autophagy , the different outcomes in the double knock down analysis may suggest the existence of different modes of reciprocal connectivity to the apoptotic module , in addition to their canonical function in autophagy . Consistent with this possibility , we found that Atg5 knock down by itself attenuated the activation of caspases3 and 7 by etoposide , resulting in a partial inhibition of PARP-1 cleavage Figure 4c . A second shRNA targeting Atg5 yielded the same results Supplementary Figure S6b . Thus , Atg5 is positively connected to a pathway that activates caspase3 , in addition to its canonical function in autophagy , thereby neutralizing the negative deviation from multiplicativity caused by the switch to autophagy . Beclin-1 on the other hand , is not connected in a positive manner to caspase3 activation in contrast , it was found to be connected to the caspase-dependent pathway in a negative manner , resulting in a significant increase in caspase3 7 activation and in PARP-1 and ICAD cleavage on its knock down Figure 4d , Supplementary Figure S6c . These conclusions further stress the power of combining fitness values with molecular data , for resolving the nature of epistatic interactions between pairs of genes . Applying computational approaches to identify components of the pathway that potentially connects Atg5 to caspase3 . Here , we further studied the newly discovered connectivity between caspase3 and Atg5 in response to etoposide . As we did not detect the presence of cleaved Atg5 data not shown in this setting , we assumed that the positive connection of Atg5 to apoptosis differs from previously described mechanisms.24,25 To translate the genetic interaction data into a molecular pathway , we applied a version of the shortest paths algorithm deve-loped for this purpose , as described above , to identify the most reliable pathways . Several potential molecular pathways that link Atg5 to caspase3 were identified by this algorithm the highest scoring one was a pathway that links Atg5 to caspase3 through Rhophilin2 RHPN2 , cyto-keratin18 and the death effector domain-containing DNA-binding protein DEDD Figure 5a . Cytokeratin18 cleavage by caspase3 was shown to be critical for the dismantling of epithelial cells during apoptosis . DEDD is a DED domain-containing protein , previously shown to be recruited to cytokeratin18 on induction of apoptosis , leading to caspase3 activation and cytokeratin18 cleavage.26 However , the mechanism of DEDD activation was not identified . RHPN2 , also known as RhoB effector protein , is a PDZ-containing protein . The major function of PDZ-containing proteins is to act as scaffolds for the assembly of large protein complexes at specific subcellular locations , and to organize intracellular signaling . RHPN2 was found to interact with cytokeratin18 27 however , the functional implication of this interaction was not further examined . On the basis of this information , one possibility implies that RHPN2 might be needed to recruit Atg5 to cytokeratin18 , resulting in Atg5� DEDD interactions , to promote caspase3 activity . Experimentally , coimmunoprecipitation in HEK293-Luc transfectants revealed that HA-tagged Atg5 interacts with Flag-tagged DEDD , thus establishing a new connection between Atg5 and DEDD that was missing in the large-scale PPI data Figure 5b . Also , these experiments further confirmed the interaction between HA-tagged Atg5 and YFP-tagged RHPN2 Figure 5c , previously suggested by the large-scale mass-spec screens.15 Next , the different components of this pathway i.e. , Atg5 , DEDD , RHPN2 were knocked-down to assess their func-tional link to caspase3 activation . To this end , HeLa cells , which are rich in Cytokeratin , 18 were exposed to staurospor-ine , and caspase3 activation was quantified by the Caspase-Glo luminescent assay . We found that in this cellular setting the knock down of Atg5 reduced caspase3 activation , thus expanding the proapoptotic effects of Atg5 to other cell lines , and to another cell death-inducing agent Figure 5d . Also , the knock down of DEDD reduced caspase3 activation consistent with previous work.26 Moreover , the knock down of RHPN2 significantly reduced caspase3 activation Figure 5d , thus establishing for the first time its functional link to caspase-dependent processes . These function-based assays , taken together with the co-immunoprecipitation experiments , are consistent with the suggestion raised by the computational approach , which links Atg5 to caspase3 activation through RHPN2 and DEDD . Thus , these data provide experimental confirmation to the computational predictions and document the potential power that resides in integrating the platform of RNAi-based perturbations with computational approaches , leading to the discovery of new biochemical pathways connecting between pairs of proteins . Discussion This work presents a multistage approach to analyzing the structure function architecture of the molecular network underlying PCD . To this end , we developed a platform that measures the outcome of single and double RNAi-mediated perturbations on both the final cell death performance and the pattern of protein connectivity , and that uses computational methods for revealing the components of the pathways mediating the newly identified genetic interactions . We provide here a proof of principle that this approach is feasible , and show that it is possible to perform epistatic type of analysis in mammalian cells by using RNAi-mediated pertur-bations , similar to the genetic interaction maps performed in yeast by double mutation analysis.28�30 Specifically , the application of this platform to cells exposed to a DNA-damaging agent , in which critical nodes from the apoptotic and autophagic modules were targeted , enabled us to assess the extent to which the cross interactions between these functional modules affect the final cell death performance . Thus , intermodular connectivity provides an additional level of hierarchy in the global cell death network . In addition , the precise quantifications by the luciferase assay were able to distinguish differences in the functional weights of different nodes in the same module . For example , we discovered that although the knock downs of Atg5 and Beclin-1 have similar effects on autophagy , they have different effects on cell death performance and on the apoptotic pathway , testifying to the additional different roles that they have in the network . This platform also provides leads for novel pathway discovery , an example of which was discovered here , linking an autophagic gene Atg5 to the apoptotic module . Thus , the network analysis can be further translated into pathway discovery by combining the available PPI databases with the more precise knowledge on the PCD set of interactions and with advanced computational approaches applied here for this purpose . Our detailed quantitative analysis indicates the existence of strong robustness in the PCD network that maintains the system performance even on attenuation of one or more death modules . Molecular analysis confirmed the existence of compensatory switches between modules , in which the activation of alternative death pathways acts as a backup mechanism . For example , the connectivity of caspase3 to autophagy allows an inducible and efficient switch from apoptosis to autophagic cell death on caspase3 perturbation , thus preventing a reduction in the overall cell death performance . The system presented here enables a quanti-tative analysis of the compensatory switch , as well as a means for the future identification of the critical molecular integrators that activate the switch . The application of this platform should be scaled up to target hundreds of pairs of genes from the PCD map , with the intention of expanding this type of analysis to the struc-ture of apoptotic autophagic necrotic modules , including the identification of various feedback loops and other complex intramodular circuits . Although the luciferase assay can be run in high-throughput format , most of the molecular assays require adaptation to multi well-based fluorescent lumines-cent readouts , focusing on the critical positions along the pathways that signify activation of specific branches . In light of our finding that only an 8�14 % reduction in cell death performance was achieved by the double perturbations of caspase3 Atg5 or caspase3 Beclin-1 , it is conceivable that many additional backup mechanisms and compensatory switches may be activated in the global network of PCD , and remain to be identified in the future . Thus , collecting precise quantitative data provides a powerful tool for future unbiased genome-wide RNAi screens , which can be per-formed on cells already carrying well-characterized double perturbations . This will serve to select the additional perturba-tion s that lead to the complete collapse of cell death performance . i.e. , more than 90 % reduction in cell death performance . Eventually , such high-throughput systems level analysis will reveal more basic principles of the hierarchical organization of the network , with the long-term goal of modeling the system and understanding both its structure and function . Materials and Methods Generation of HEK293 cells stably expressing luciferase 293�Luc . To generate cells stably expressing luciferase , HEK293 cells were transfected with pcDNA3 vector containing the firefly luciferase gene under the control of a CMV promoter . The cells were grown in the presence of 1 mg ml G418 Calbiochem , San Diego , CA , USA , and selected clones were individually isolated to create monoclonal populations stably expressing luciferase . Seven clones were obtained , three of which expressed high levels of luciferase , while maintaining normal growth rates characteristic of the parental HEK293 cells , and similar responses to various death stimuli . One of these clones was chosen for further work . Luciferase-based cell viability assay and statistical analysis . HEK293-Luc cells were transfected with shRNA targeting one or two genes , or with HcRed-targeting shRNA as a negative control , by the standard calcium phosphate technique . Two days later , cells were seeded in parallel to black 96-well plates with transparent bottoms Nunc , and to 9 cm plates . After 24 h , cells were treated with 50 mM etoposide or DMSO Sigma , Rehovot , Israel as a negative control . At the indicated times , large plates were extracted for western blot analysis , whereas a luciferase assay was performed on 96-well plates , in 10 replicates for each perturbation treated or non-treated . Cells were lysed in reporter lysis buffer Promega , Madison , WI , USA , followed by a single freeze-thaw cycle . Cell viability was assessed by measuring luciferase activity Promega , using the Veritas microplate luminometer Turner BioSystems , Sunnyvale , CA , USA . Overall cell survival was determined by dividing the mean luciferase activity of cells treated with etoposide by the mean activity of cells treated with DMSO for each knock down experiment . Caspase-Glo assay . HeLa JW cells were transfected with the indicated short interfering RNAi oligos siRNAs Dharmacon , Termo Fisher Scientific , Lafayette , CO , USA , or with non-targeting siRNA as a negative control non-targeting # 2 , Dharmacon by the standard calcium phosphate technique . Two days later , cells were seeded onto 96-well plates with transparent bottoms Nunc . After 24 h , cells were treated with 3 mM staurosporine or DMSO Sigma for 4 h and subjected to caspase activity assay Caspas-Glo , Promega . The assay was performed in four replicates on 96-well plates using a microplate luminometer Turner BioSystems . Cell number was assessed using the CyQUANT assay Invitrogen , Paisley , Scotland . Statistical analysis . The numbers obtained by the luciferase-based assay , in 10 replicates for each perturbation e.g. , see Supplementary Figures S4b and S6a , were subjected to statistical analysis , and a difference from the non-perturbed cells was considered statistically significant if the resulting test statistic was higher than 2 lower than 2 . As we are dealing with a ratio , its variance was calculated by the variance of the ratio equation as follows 31 Where Var stands for variance and yi , i ? 1 , 2 , is the mean of the distribution of Xi . The test statistic is Where X1,2 is the perturbed case with without etoposide , and Y1,2 is the non-perturbed case with without etoposide . Owing to biological variation , each experiment was repeated at least three times each time in 10 replicates for each perturbation , as described above . The test statistic numbers obtained from three independent experiments for Atg5 single perturbation , or from the double perturbation experiments were subjected to Fisher�s combined probability test.32 A difference was considered statistically significant if the resulting P-value was smaller than 0.05 . The single Atg5 perturbation , and the two pairs of double perturbations analyzed in this work , displayed statistically significant P-values . The distribution of the test statistic numbers obtained from nine independent experiments for caspase3 , and from three independent experiments for Beclin-1 , were compared with the distribution obtained when the non-perturbed control values were compared with each other . Although the latter was lower than caspase3 and Beclin-1�s distribution , the results were not conclusive . Moreover , S.D. calculation for the cell death performance values see below clearly showed that the cell death performance obtained when caspase3 or Beclin-1 was perturbed was not statistically different from the control Figure 4a . Therefore , we concluded that caspase3 and Beclin-1 single perturbations did not influence the cell death performance obtained when 293-Luc cells were treated with etoposide . The values reflecting the percentage cell death derived from three independent experiments for Atg5 , Beclin-1 , and the combinatorial silencing perturbations , and of three or six independent experiments for the caspase3 perturbation were normalized to the control non-perturbed cells to obtain the cell death performance value i.e. , 100 % cell death performance is the maximum cell death capacity measured in the unperturbed cells . S.D. values for the average cell death performance were then calculated . Epistasis test . The double perturbation fitness calculations were performed as follows . The cell death performance measured under silencing perturbation of protein X or protein Y is defined as Wx and Wy , respectively . The expected cell death performance of double perturbation of proteins that operate along independent pathways is Wx Wy , and the measured cell death performance is defined as Wxy . The deviation from multiplicativity i.e. , e was calculated as the difference between the cell death performance obtained experimentally and the calculated expected cell death performance i.e. , exy ? Wxy Wx Wy .23 An aggravating interaction was considered statistically significant when the respective e was more than 1 S.D. away from 0 . The S.D. of e De was calculated as The S.D. of the expected performance D Wx Wy was calculated using a formula of uncertainty as follows Although the negative deviation from multiplicativity in the caspase3 Beclin1 double perturbations was statistically significant , the double perturbation fitness calculation of caspase3 Atg5 was not significantly different from 0 . Pathway inference . We represent the human PPI network as a directed graph where nodes correspond to proteins and edges connect interacting proteins . Every interaction e is assigned a confidence value 0oP e o1 , computed as in study by Sharan et al.16 Every protein v is assigned a confidence value 0oP v o1 , defined as minuAQ ssim u , v , where Q is the PCD protein set and ssim u , v is the semantic similarity17 of the proteins u and v , based on the GO biological process annotations . Assuming independence between the proteins , the overall likelihood of a path H is where E H , and V H are the edges and nodes in H . To control for the length of the inferred paths , we follow the approach of Shachar et al.33 and add a length-penalizing factor by redefining the probability of H as where the per-edge penalty e d is set to the probability of an edge at the 25th percentile . To facilitate the computation of a reliable path between a given a pair of proteins , we define a weight function w on the nodes and edges in the network . The weights are taken as the log of the respective confidence value . We then search for a path H along which the sum of weights of nodes and edges is minimum . An optimal solution for this problem can be found in polynomial time using the Dijkstra algorithm . In our implementation , we used an extension of this algorithm and considered all pathways whose weight is up to a factor of 5 % from the optimal solution . Supplementary methods .

20150917	Owing to its invariant pattern of apoptotic cell death during development , Caenorhabditis elegans has become an impor-tant model for apoptosis studies . The central cell death machinery in C. elegans is composed of the anti-apoptotic BCL-2-like protein CED-9 , the APAF-1-like caspase activator CED-4 and the pro-caspase proCED-3.1,2 At least during mid-embryogenesis when the majority of cell deaths occur , most if not all cells in developing embryos contain CED-4 as well as proCED-3 , which once matured is sufficient for apoptosis induction.3�5 However , these cells also contain the CED-9 protein , which through its direct interaction with CED-4 , blocks the ability of CED-4 to mediate proCED-3 maturation.3,4 As a result , apoptosis induction is prevented . During the development of a C. elegans hermaphrodite , exactly 131 cells are programmed to die.6 The majority of these cells die B30 min after being generated . Furthermore , in these cells , the transcriptional activation of the BH3-only gene egl-1 is thought to be sufficient for the activation of the central cell death machinery and , hence , apoptosis induc-tion.7 Specifically , the BH3-only protein EGL-1 can bind to CED-9 thereby causing CED-4 release from CED-9 and CED-4-dependent proCED-3 maturation . Interestingly , recent data suggest that the ced-3 gene is not transcriptionally active in most of the 131 cells that are programmed to die during development.4 This observation suggests that proCED-3 protein present in these cells is derived from their progenitors . It also suggests that once activated , the amount of proCED-3 protein inherited from progenitors is , in general , sufficient for apoptosis induction . The four male-specific cephalic companion neurons CEMs are generated B320 min after the first cell division . In males , the CEMs survive and differentiate into ciliated sensory neurons implicated in mating behavior.6,8,9 In hermaphrodites , however , the CEMs undergo apoptosis B150 min after being generated B470 min after the first cell division . As is the case for most of the cells that are programmed to die during development , the death of the CEMs is dependent on the genes egl-1 , ced-4 , and ced-3.10,11 The death of the CEMs is also dependent on the gene tra-1 , which encodes the terminal , global regulator of somatic sexual fate , and which acts to promote female development.12 Specifically , the TRA-1 protein , a GLI-like transcription factor , causes the CEMs in hermaphrodites to undergo apoptosis by directly repressing the transcription of the gene ceh-30 , which encodes a Bar homeodomain transcription factor that acts to block the death of the CEMs in males.13,14 How the CEH-30 protein acts on the central cell death machinery to block the death of the CEMs has so far been unclear . We now present evidence that CEH-30 blocks the death of the CEMs by repressing the transcription of both the egl-1 and ced-3 gene . Furthermore , we identified three genes , unc-86 , lrs-1 , and unc-132 , which encode a POU home-odomain transcription factor , a leucyl-tRNA synthetase , and a novel protein with limited sequence similarity to the mamma-lian proto-oncoprotein and kinase PIM-1 , respectively , that promote ceh-30 expression in the CEMs . Our data show that in contrast to most cells that are programmed to die during development , in the CEMs , the transcriptional upregulation of both the BH3-only gene egl-1 and the caspase gene ced-3 is required for apoptosis induction . We propose that coupling the transcriptional upregulation of a key activator of apoptosis induction egl-1 and a component of the central , enzymatic cell death machinery ced-3 ensures efficient apoptosis induction in the CEMs . Results bc151 , bc155 , and bc159 cause differentiated CEMs to be absent from masculinized hermaphrodites or males . An altered-function mutation of the C. elegans gene sel-10 , n1077 , which encodes an F-box protein that promotes female development , causes weak masculinization of the hermaphrodite soma.15�17 For example , in wild-type hermaphrodites , the four CEMs undergo apoptosis.6,8 In contrast , in sel-10 n1077 hermaphrodites , the CEMs survive like in wild-type males . To identify genes required for the survival of the CEMs , we sought mutations that cause the CEMs to be absent from sel-10 n1077 hermaphrodites based on the expression of pkd-2 , a marker for differentiated CEMs Genotype XX a Presence of differentiated CEMs in adults + + 0 Many see Materials and Methods . We identified three recessive mutations , bc151 , bc155 , and bc159 , that cause the majority of CEMs to be absent from masculinized hermaphrodites as well as males Table 1a data not shown . The CEMs are also absent in bc151 , bc155 , or bc159 masculinized hermaphro-dites based on their characteristic morphology in L4 larvae Table 1b and in bc151 , bc155 , or bc159 males based on lov-1 expression , another marker for differentiated CEMs Supplementary Table S1 . In addition , all three mutations cause a reduced brood size and an uncoordinated or �Unc� phenotype Supplementary Table S2 data not shown . On the basis of these observations , we conclude that bc151 , bc155 , and bc159 cause differentiated CEMs to be absent in masculinized hermaphrodites and males . bc151 is a loss-of-function mutation of unc-86 POU . unc-86 , which encodes a POU transcription factor , has previously been shown to be required for the presence of differentiated CEMs in males.13,18,19 We found that bc151 animals carry two mutations in the unc-86 gene first , a missense mutation leading to an aspartic acid GAU -to-asparagine AAU substitution at position 203 of the protein sequence of the UNC-86.b protein generated by transcript C30A5.7b second , a nonsense mutation , changing codon 220 of the C30A5.7b coding sequence CAA to a STOP codon UAA Figure 1a . Both unc-86 transcripts C30A5.7a , C30A5.7b are predicted to be affected by the two mutations . As loss-of-function mutations of unc-86 have previously been shown to cause differentiated CEMs to be absent in males , we conclude that bc151 is a new loss-of-function mutation of the unc-86 gene . b Presence of CEMs in L4 larvae bc155 is a loss-of-function mutation of the gene lrs-1 leucyl-tRNA synthetase . We found that bc155 is a mutation in the gene lrs-1 , which encodes a leucyl-tRNA synthetase , a Class I tRNA synthetase Figure 1b data not shown .20 bc155 is a G-to-A transition that changes the 30 splice acceptor site of intron 3 from AG to AA , which results in reduced levels of fully spliced lrs-1 mRNA Figure 1b data not shown . Both lrs-1 transcripts R74.1.1 , R74.1.2 are predicted to be affected by the bc155 mutation . Reducing lrs-1 function by RNAi results in the absence of differentiated CEMs in masculinized hermaphrodites Table 2a . On the basis of these findings , we conclude that bc155 is a loss-of-function mutation of the gene lrs-1 . Furthermore , we found that reducing the function by RNAi of genes encoding other Class I or Class II tRNA synthetases can result in the absence of at least 20 % of differentiated CEMs in masculinized hermaphrodites Table 2a . bc159 is a loss-of-function mutation of the PIM-1-like gene unc-132 . bc159 is a mutation in a previously uncharacterized gene , W08A12.1 , which generates five transcripts . Transcript W08A12.1.a encodes a 501 amino-acid protein of unknown function with a P-loop domain Figure 1c .21,22 As bc159 also causes an Unc phenotype , we named W08A12.1 �unc-132� . The bc159 mutation affects the second exon that is common to all five unc-132 trans-cripts . Specifically , bc159 is a missense mutation that leads to a methionine AUG -to-isoleucine AUA substitution at position 200 of the protein sequence of the UNC-132.a protein generated by transcript W08A12.1.a . The reduction of unc-132 function by RNAi causes differentiated CEMs to be absent in a sel-10 n1077 background Table 2b , confirming that bc159 is a loss-of-function mutation of the unc-132 gene . unc-132 is orthologous to a gene of unknown function in Drosophila melanogaster , CG30118.21 Among mammalian proteins , UNC-132 is most similar to the human kinase PIM-1 however , the two proteins are not ortho-logous.22 As is the case for UNC-132 and CG30118 , PIM-1 has a P-loop domain . However , in contrast to UNC-132 and CG30118 , PIM-1 also contains a kinase domain . a Inactivation by RNAi of lrs-1 and other genes encoding tRNA synthetases Class I tRNA synthetases Class II tRNA synthetases The loss of unc-86 , lrs-1 , or unc-132 function causes a defect in CEM specification . Next , we determined the fate of the CEMs in masculinized hermaphrodites lacking unc-86 , lrs-1 , or unc-132 function . Briefly , a mutation that blocks apoptotic cell death in general ced-3 n717 failed to suppress the CEM phenotype observed in these mutant backgrounds , which indicates that the CEMs do not inappro-priately undergo apoptosis Tables 1a and b . In addition , we found that the loss of lrs-1 or unc-132 function does not affect the presence of differentiated dorsal URAs or amphid socket cells , the sisters of the dorsal CEMs and ventral CEMs , respectively , 6 which indicates that the CEMs are generated Table 3 . Finally , as shown below , we can detect CEMs in unc-86 mutant embryos using a transcriptional egl-1 reporter . Therefore , we conclude that the CEMs are also generated in animals lacking unc-86 function . On the basis of these observations , we propose that masculinized hermaphrodites lacking unc-86 , lrs-1 , or unc-132 function lack differentiated CEMs as a result of a defect in the specification rather than generation or survival of the CEMs . unc-86 , lrs-1 , and unc-132 are required for ceh-30 expression in the CEMs in masculinized herma - phrodites . The Bar homeodomain transcription factor CEH-30 , whose expression is under the direct control of the terminal , global regulator of somatic sexual fate , TRA-1 , acts to block the death of the CEMs.13,14 Specifically , the loss of ceh-30 function causes the CEMs to inappropriately die in males as well as in masculinized hermaphrodites , indicating that ceh-30 is required for CEM survival13,14 P Grote and B Conradt , unpublished data . Using a translational ceh-30 reporter Pceh 30ceh-30 gfp and 4D lineaging analysis , 14,23,24 we determined the expression pattern of the ceh-30 gene in the CEMs in embryos starting at B320min , the time at which they are generated , until B470min , the time at which the CEMs normally die in hermaphrodites.6 We found that in wild-type hermaphrodites , in which the CEMs die , ceh-30 expression in the CEMs can only be detected right after the cells are generated Figure 2 , ? ? Supplementary Figure S1 . ceh-30 expression can not be detected in the mother cell and can no longer be detected in the CEMs at B360min or later time points Figure 2 . In masculinized hermaphrodites , however , in which the CEMs survive , ceh-30 expression in the CEMs can be detected starting at B400min Figure 2 , sel-10 n1077 . Next , we analyzed the expression of the ceh-30 reporter in the CEMs in masculinized hermaphrodites lacking unc-86 , lrs-1 , or unc-132 function in which , as described above , the CEMs are generated and survive , but are misspecified . We found that in these animals , at B470 min , ceh-30 is not expressed in most CEMs Figures 3a and b . This result was surprising as the loss of ceh-30 function causes the CEMs to inappropriately die in masculinized hermaphrodites . On the basis of these observations , we conclude that unc-86 , lrs-1 , and unc-132 are required for the expression of ceh-30 in the CEMs in masculinized hermaphrodites Figure 4 . We also conclude that apart from promoting ceh-30 expression , unc-86 , lrs-1 , and unc-132 have an additional function , which is to promote CEM death in a ceh-30-independent manner Figure 4 . The loss of unc-86 , lrs-1 , or unc-132 function causes de-repression of egl-1 transcription in the CEMs in masculinized hermaphrodites . Using a transcriptional reporter Pegl 1his-24 gfp and 4D lineaging analysis , we analyzed the expression of the egl-1 gene in the CEMs.25 We found that in wild-type hermaphrodites , in which the CEMs die , egl-1 transcription can be detected in the CEMs starting at B400 min Figure 2 , ? ? Supplementary Figure S1 . In contrast , in masculinized hermaphrodites , in which the CEMs survive , egl-1 transcription can not be detected in the CEMs Figure 2 , sel-10 n1077 . As mentioned above , the loss of ceh-30 function causes the CEMs to inappropriately die in masculinized hermaphrodites . We found that the loss of ceh-30 function causes egl-1 to be inappropriately trans-cribed in the CEMs in masculinized hermaphrodites at B470 min Figures 5a and b . These results show that ceh-30 functions to repress egl-1 transcription in the CEMs in masculinized hermaphrodites Figure 4 . To determine why the CEMs in masculinized hermaphro-dites lacking unc-86 , lrs-1 , or unc-132 function , but not ceh-30 sel-10 n1077 were homozygous for dpy-17 e164 function , fail to inappropriately die , we analyzed egl-1 trans-cription in the CEMs in masculinized hermaphrodites lacking unc-86 , lrs-1 , or unc-132 at B470 min . To our surprise , we found that the CEMs in these animals transcribe egl-1 at this time point Figures 5a and b . This observation indicates that , unlike in masculinized hermaphrodites lack-ing ceh-30 function , in masculinized hermaphrodites lacking unc-86 , lrs-1 , or unc-132 function , the transcriptional upregu-lation of egl-1 in the CEMs is not sufficient for their apoptotic death . ced-3 is transcribed in the CEMs in hermaphrodites and its transcription in the CEMs in masculinized herma - phrodites is repressed by ceh-30 . Using a reporter for the caspase gene ced-3 , it has been shown that ced-3 is not transcribed in most of the 131 cells that are programmed to die.4 However , ced-3 is actively transcribed in at least one cell that is programmed to die , the tail spike cell.4 Like the CEMs , the tail spike cell survives much longer than most cells programmed to die B300 min before it dies . For this reason , we explored whether the ced-3 gene is transcribed in the CEMs before their deaths in hermaphrodites . Using a transcriptional reporter Pced gfp and 4D linea-3 ging analysis , we found that in wild-type hermaphrodites , in which the CEMs die , ced-3 transcription can be detected in the CEMs starting at B460 min Figure 2 , ? ? Supplementary Figure S1 . Therefore , the ced-3 gene is transcriptionally active in the CEMs . Furthermore , we found that in masculi-nized hermaphrodites , in which the CEMs survive , ced-3 transcription can not be detected Figure 2 , sel-10 n1077 . Next , we determined the role of ceh-30 in ced-3 transcription in the CEMs . We found that in masculinized hermaphrodites lacking ceh-30 function , in which the CEMs inappropriately die , ced-3 is transcribed in the CEMs at B470 min Figures 6a and b . Therefore , we conclude that ceh-30 functions to repress ced-3 transcription in the CEMs in masculinized hermaphrodites . The loss of unc-86 , lrs-1 , or unc-132 function does not cause activation of ced-3 transcription in the CEMs in masculinized hermaphrodites . To determine the role of unc-86 , lrs-1 , and unc-132 in ced-3 transcriptional control in the CEMs , we analyzed the expression of the Pced 3gfp reporter in masculinized hermaphrodites lacking unc-86 , lrs-1 , or unc-132 function at B470 min . We found that , like in masculinized hermaphrodites , the ced-3 gene is not transcribed in most CEMs at this time point Figures 6a and b . Therefore , while the loss of unc-86 , lrs-1 , or unc-132 function results in the de-repression of egl-1 transcription in the CEMs in masculinized hermaphrodites , it does not result in the de-repression of ced-3 transcription . On the basis of this observation we conclude that unc-86 , lrs-1 , and unc-132 not only repress ced-3 transcription in a ceh-30-dependent manner but also promote ced-3 transcription in a ceh-30-independent manner Figure 4 . Furthermore , we propose that the CEMs in masculinized hermaphrodites lacking unc-86 , lrs-1 , or unc-132 function fail to die because ced-3 transcription in the CEMs is not activated . Discussion Transcriptional upregulation of both egl-1 and ced-3 is required for the apoptotic death of the CEMs in hermaphrodites . The transcriptional upregulation of egl-1 is thought to be necessary and sufficient for many of the cell death events that take place during C. elegans development.7 We found that egl-1 is transcriptionally active in the CEMs in hermaphrodites in which the CEMs die but not in masculinized hermaphrodites and most probably males in which the CEMs survive . However , our results show that the transcriptional upregulation of egl-1 in the CEMs in hermaphrodites is necessary , but not sufficient for their death . The ced-3 gene does not appear to be transcriptionally active in many of the cells that are programmed to die during development.4 However , we found that ced-3 is transcriptionally active in the CEMs in hermaphrodites in which the CEMs die but not in masculinized hermaphrodites in which the CEMs survive . Furthermore , we present data that indicate that transcriptional activation of ced-3 in the CEMs is necessary for their death in hermaphrodites . On the basis of these findings , we propose that in contrast to most cells that are programmed to die during development , in the CEMs , the transcriptional upregulation of egl-1 and ced-3 is necessary for their death in hermaphrodites . This is the first demonstration that the transcriptional upregulation of both a BH3-only gene as well as a caspase gene is required for apoptosis induction . What distinguishes the CEMs from the majority of cells that die during development is that rather than surviving for only B30 min after being generated , they survive for B150 min.6 In the majority of cells that are programmed to die proCED-3 protein is inherited from progenitors.4 On the basis of this observation , we propose that at the time apoptosis induction takes place in the CEMs , as a result of proCED-3 turn over , the level of progenitor-derived proCED-3 has reached a level in the CEMs that is no longer sufficient for apoptosis induction Figure 7 . For this reason , the transcriptional upregulation of not only the egl-1 gene but also the ced-3 gene is necessary for apoptosis induction in the CEMs . CEH-30 represses egl-1 and ced-3 transcription thereby promoting CEM survival . The inappropriate death of CEMs in males lacking ceh-30 function is suppressed by the loss of egl-1 function.14 This suggests that the egl-1 gene acts downstream of the ceh-30 gene and is a potential target of the CEH-30 transcription factor . However , analyses performed with a gain-of-function mutation of ceh-30 suggest that the ceh-30 gene blocks the death of the CEMs by acting in parallel to or downstream of egl-1.14 We present data that indicate that the inappropriate death of CEMs in masculinized hermaphrodites lacking ceh-30 function is the result of the transcriptional de-repression of the pro-apoptotic genes egl-1 and ced-3 . In other words , we show that the ceh-30 gene acts both upstream of as well as in parallel to egl-1 to prevent the activation of the central cell death machinery . We propose that the CEH-30 protein is required to repress egl-1 and ced-3 transcription in the CEMs of masculinized hermaphrodites , thereby causing their survival Figure 4 . Whether CEH-30 represses egl-1 and ced-3 transcription directly or indirectly remains to be determined . ceh-30 transcription in the CEMs is dependent on unc-86 , lrs-1 , and unc-132 function . The ceh-30 gene is transcriptionally active in the CEMs in males and masculinized hermaphrodites , but not in hermaphrodites . In hermaphrodites , ceh-30 transcription in the CEMs is directly repressed by the GLI-like transcription factor TRA-1 , which is the terminal , global regulator of somatic sexual fate12�14 Figure 4 . Our results indicate that the genes unc-86 , lrs-1 , and unc-132 , which are required for correct CEM speci-fication , are necessary for ceh-30 transcriptional activation in the CEMs in masculinized hermaphrodites Figure 4 . unc-86 encodes a POU homeodomain transcription factor that has previously been implicated in CEM specification and differentiation.18,19 Our results show that the UNC-86 protein is required for ceh-30 transcription in the CEMs , which is consistent with previous studies that suggest that UNC-86 acts as a direct activator of ceh-30 transcription.13 Surpri-singly , lrs-1 encodes a leucyl-tRNA synthetase . On the basis of our analyses , compromising translation by decreasing the level of at least certain aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases abro-gates ceh-30 transcription in the CEMs . Therefore , we propose that ceh-30 transcription is particularly sensitive to perturbations of the translational machinery . Finally , unc-132 encodes a novel protein of unknown function . The D. melano-gaster orthologue of unc-132 , CG30118 , was identified in a screen for genes involved in Drosophila hematopoiesis.21 However , the mechanism through which CG30118 acts has so far not been determined . Furthermore , we found that the N-terminal region of the UNC-132 protein shares sequence similarity with the N-terminal region of the human proto-oncoprotein PIM-1.22 PIM-1 is a serine threonine kinase , which is involved in various cellular processes.26 However , the roles of PIM-1 in these processes are thought to be dependent on its kinase activity . As UNC-132 does not contain a classical kinase domain , it is unclear how extensive the functional similarities between PIM-1 and UNC-132 are . In summary , although UNC-86 may be a direct activator of ceh-30 transcription , the mechanisms through which LRS-1 and UNC-132 promote ceh-30 transcription in the CEMs remain to be elucidated . unc-86 , lrs-1 , and unc-132 promote ced-3 transcription in the CEMs in a ceh-30-independent manner thereby promoting their death . unc-86 , lrs-1 , and unc-132 are required for ceh-30 transcriptional activation in the CEMs in masculinized hermaphrodites . However , although we found that the loss of ceh-30 function results in the de-repression of both egl-1 and ced-3 transcription , the loss of unc-86 , lrs-1 , or unc-132 function only results in the activation of egl-1 transcription . For this reason , we propose that apart from blocking egl-1 and ced-3 transcription in a ceh-30-dependent manner , unc-86 , lrs-1 , and unc-132 also promote ced-3 transcription in a ceh-30-independent manner Figure 4 . We hypothesize that the ability of unc-86 , lrs-1 , and unc-132 to promote ced-3 transcription in a ceh-30-independent manner is relevant in hermaphrodites in which the ced-3 gene is relieved of ceh-30-dependent transcriptional repression Figure 4 , XX . Conversely , their ability to block ced-3 trans-cription in a ceh-30-dependent manner may be relevant in males and masculinized hermaphrodites in which the ceh-30 gene is relieved of TRA-1-dependent transcriptional repres-sion Figure 4 , XO , sel-10 n1077 . How unc-86 , lrs-1 , and unc-132 promote ced-3 transcription in the CEMs in herma-phrodites remains to be determined . Why do the CEMs survive for 150min ? The CEMs are born B320 min after the first cell division and die in herma-phrodites at B470 min.6 The TRA-1 protein has a pivotal function in the life-versus-death decision of the CEMs . In the CEMs , TRA-1 represses ceh-30 transcription thereby causing egl-1 and ced-3 de-repression and apoptosis induction . The activity of TRA-1 is regulated at the post-translational level by sex-specific cleavage and proteolysis.12 Currently , it is unclear when during embryonic development active TRA-1 protein is first generated in hermaphrodites . However , experiments using a temperature-sensitive loss-of-function mutation of the gene tra-2 , which acts upstream of tra-1 in somatic sex determination , suggest that active TRA-1 might be generated in hermaphrodites starting at B320 min.27 This notion is supported by the finding that the ceh-30 gene , whose expression is directly repressed by TRA-1 , is no longer expressed at B360 min Figures 2 and 7 . On the basis of these observations , we propose that the CEMs die only at B470 min , because a level of active TRA-1 first has to be generated in the CEMs in herma-phrodites that is sufficient for the transcriptional repression of ceh-30 , which is a prerequisite for the transcriptional de-repression of egl-1 and ced-3 at B390 min and 460 min , respectively Figure 7 . Hence , we propose that the timing of the death of the CEMs is controlled by the sex determination pathway and , in particular , its terminal , global regulator , the Gli-like transcription factor TRA-1 . Potential role for the coexpression of BH3-only and caspase genes in the developmental control of apop - tosis . At least during animal development , pro-caspases are thought to be present in most if not all cells.1,2 Furthermore , pro-caspases are thought to be present at levels that , once they become matured and activated , are sufficient for apoptosis induction . As the maturation and activation of pro-caspases generally represents the commitment of a cell to the apoptotic fate , it is a highly regulated process.28 In contrast , very little is known thus far about the contribution of transcriptional control in the regulation of pro-caspases . The most comprehensive studies available to date were performed in D. melanogaster . These studies suggest that transcriptional regulation of caspase genes has an impor-tant function in apoptosis induction at least during D. melanogaster development.1,29 The data presented here show that the transcriptional upregulation of the C. elegans caspase gene ced-3 is required for the sexually dimorphic , apoptotic death of the CEM neurons . On the basis of these findings , we propose that the transcriptional upregulation of caspase genes is a conserved aspect of apoptosis induction during animal development . Furthermore , our data show that in C. elegans , genes encoding BH3-only proteins and pro-caspases can be under the same transcriptional control . We hypothesize that such coregulatory mechanisms have evolved to ensure efficient apoptosis induction during development . Materials and Methods Strains and general methods . C. elegans strains were cultured as described.30 Bristol N2 was used as the wild-type strain . N2 and the CB4856 Hawaii strain were used for SNP mapping .

Grote and B. Conradt unpublished data , lin-15 n765ts , bcIs9 Ppkd gfp .33 The following extrachromosomal arrays were used 2 nEx1171 Pceh 30ceh-30 gfp , 14 bgEx21 Punc 53gfp , 34 syEx301 Plov 1gfp , 35 nsEx37 Pcfi gfp , 36 akEx32 Pglr glr-4 gfp .37 1 4 RNAi by feeding was performed as described using 6 mM IPTG.38 The plasmids pBC966 W08A12.1b RNAi and pBC967 W08A12.1c RNAi contained full-length cDNA clones cloned as NcoI-NheI fragments into vector L4440 . sel-10 n1077 bcIs9 animals were mutagenized with EMS ethyl-methanesulfonate as described.30 Germline transformations were performed as described.39 Cosmids and fosmids were injected at a concentration of 10 ng ml using pRF4 rol-6 su1006 at 50 ng ml as coinjection marker . The plasmid Pced gfp was injected at 40 ng ml 3 using pRF4 rol-6 su1006 50 ng ml as coinjection marker . In the case of bcIs9 Ppkd gfp , syEx301 Plov gfp , bgEx21 Punc gfp , nsEx37 Pcfi gfp , akEx32 2 1 53 1 Pglr 4glr-4 gfp , bcIs37 Pegl 1his-24 gfp , and nEx1171 Pceh 30ceh-30 gfp , transgenic animals were crossed with unc-86 bc151 , lrs-1 bc155 or unc - 132 bc159 mutants to generate unc-86 bc151 , lrs-1 bc155 and unc-132 bc159 strains carrying these arrays . pBC957 Pced gfp was constructed by removing an 3 internal , 4.6 kb EcoRV fragment containing most of the ced-3 coding sequence from a ced-3 reporter.4 sel-10 n1077 screen and cloning of unc-86 bc151 , lrs-1 bc155 , and unc-132 bc159 . �Undead� CEMs in sel-10 n1077 hermaphrodites have the characteristic CEM morphology when observed by differential interference contrast microscopy DIC in L4 larvae , and express CEM-specific markers in adults , such as the genes pkd-2 Ppkd gfp and lov-1 Plov gfp .35 These observations indicate 2 1 that the CEMs in sel-10 n1077 hermaphrodites are correctly specified and fully differentiated . We mutagenized sel-10 n1077 hermaphrodites carrying an integrated Ppkd 2gfp transgene bcIs9 , screened 8500 mutagenized , haploid genomes for mutants in which differentiated CEMs were absent based on pkd-2 expression and identified 49 mutants . Among these mutants , 21 still had CEMs based on DIC and therefore most likely harbor mutations that affect pkd-2 expression . In addition , in 20 mutants , all aspects of the weak masculinization caused by sel-10 n1077 were suppressed , indicating that they most likely carry feminizing mutations or loss-of-function mutations in the sel-10 gene . Of the remaining eight mutations , one behaved non-Mendelian , one could not be outcrossed , and three caused the CEMs to be absent in masculinized sel-10 n1077 hermaphrodites , but not males . The final three mutations , bc151 , bc155 , and bc159 , were characterized further . Standard genetic techniques were used to map bc151 to the right of dpy-17 on LG III , bc155 between unc-93 and dpy-17 on LG III , and bc159 to the left of dpy-11 on LG V. bc151 bc151 failed to complement unc-86 n846 , a lf allele of the gene unc-86 , indicating that bc151 is a loss-of-function mutation in the unc-86 gene . bc155 SNP mapping was used to locate bc155 between the SNPs C30D11 9408 and R10E4 10469 . The fosmid WRM0638-J8 rescued the phenotype observed in bc159 SNP mapping was used to map bc159 to the left of SNP H10D18 26865 . The cosmid W08A12 rescued the phenotype observed in bc159 sel-10 n1077 bcIs9 animals . The bc159 phenotype was also rescued by a 31.3-kb XcmI subclone of W08A12 pBC430 , containing the genes W08A12.1 , W08A12.2 , and egr-1 and was partially rescued by a 23.9-kb ApaI subclone of W08A12 pBC431 , spanning the genes W08A12.4 , egr-1 , and W08A12.1 . Phenotypic analysis . The presence of CEMs in adults was analyzed using bcIs9 Ppkd 2gfp and a Zeiss Axioskop2 equipped with epifluorescence as described.33 The % GFP-positive CEMs was calculated by dividing the number of CEMs observed by the maximum number of possible CEMs four CEMs per animal . The presence of CEMs in L4 larvae was analyzed using DIC as described.8 The presence of CEMs in embryos was analyzed as follows . CEMs were identified by DIC in 11 -fold stage embryos B450 min based on their positions and observed for at least B30 min . As the positions of the two dorsal CEMs are less characteristic , these cells could not always be examined . CEM corpses appear in two-fold embryos B465 min . Microscopy of living embryos was performed by mounting embryos on 2 % agar pads in M9 buffer , using a Zeiss Axioskop2 equipped with epifluorescence , a Micromax CCD camera Princeton Instruments , Trenton , NJ , USA , and Metamorph software . DIC and epifluorescence images were taken every 5 min between the 11-and 2-fold stage to determine the fate of the CEMs and the expression of the GFP reporters in embryonic CEMs . The presence of the AMso amphid socket cells was scored in adults using Punc 53gfp as described.37 The presence of the URA cells was determined in adults using two different reporters , Pglr grl-4 gfp and Pcfi gfp , as described.36 4 1 4D microscopy and lineage analysis . 4D microscopy and lineaging analysis as shown in Figure 2 was performed on C. elegans embryos as described earlier.23,24 Embryos were recorded at 20 1C , and GFP expression of the reporters Pceh 30ceh-30 gfp , Pegl 1his-24 gfp and Pced 3gfp was recorded after every 30 DIC stacks . The 4D recordings were analyzed using the SIMI BioCell software as described earlier.23,40 The ventral left CEM CEMVL , ABplpaapapp was lineaged in all embryos . Starting at the 2-to 4-cell stage , cells were tracked and their 3D coordinates were saved approximately every 2 min , until at least B465 min after the first cell division . In addition , the 3D coordinates of the CEMVL progenitor ABplpaapap or CEMVL were saved at the time points when GFP expression of the reporters Pceh ceh-30 gfp , Pegl his-24 gfp , or Pced gfp was recorded . Using 30 1 3 this approach , the status of expression of these reporters in the CEM could be determined . The cell death fate of the CEMVL was determined at B465 min by DIC . To determine the expression of the reporters Pceh 30ceh-30 gfp , Pegl 1his-24 gfp , or Pced 3gfp at B470 min after the first cell division as shown in Figures 3 , 5 , and 6 , we identified the CEMs in embryos B450 min after the first cell division based on their positions using DIC and observed them for B30 min using fluorescence microscopy . At the end of the recording , we determined the cell death fate of the CEMs using DIC Apoptotic cells adopt a button-like , refractile appearance , which can be detected by DIC .

Top panel Most cells programmed to die do so B30 min after being generated .

Bottom panel The CEMs in hermaphrodites die B150 min after being generated B470 min after the first cell division . Increasing TRA-1 activity results in decreasing CEH-30 activity , which is required for the de-repression of egl-1 and ced-3 transcription . The activation at the transcriptional level of the ced-3 gene compensates for decreased levels of proCED-3 . See text for details 
20168332	Review L Anastasia* , 1,2 , G Pelissero2 , B Venerando1,2 and G Tettamanti2 Stem cells and cell reprogramming have generated an enormous interest in the past 2 years , since the generation of induced pluripotent stem cells iPSCs from mouse embryonic fibroblasts was first reported by Yamanaka and coworkers in 2006.1,2 In fact , it was shown that the forced expression of four defined factors Oct3 4 , Sox2 , Klf4 , and c-Myc is able to reprogram a fraction of mouse embryonic fibroblasts into pluripotent cells , almost indistinguishable from bona fide embryonic stem cells ESCs . Successively , human adult fibroblasts have also been reprogrammed to iPSCs by the same four factors , 3�8 or by combinations of other factors , which included Nanog and Lin 28.9 Moreover , iPSCs cells have been generated also from other cell types including adult hepatocytes , gastric epithelial cells , and mesenchymal cells.4,10 However , it has been reported that iPSCs obtained from different adult cells possess a different teratoma-forming propensity in a cell transplantation therapy model using mouse secondary neurospheres differentiated from iPSCs , suggesting that it will be extremely important to elucidate this issue before future clinical applications.11 Nonetheless , these discoveries have generated an unprecedented deal of interest toward stem cell research , mostly for these reasons 1 iPSCs generation does not require the use and disruption of embryos , thus it completely overcomes the ethical draw-backs associated to the use of human ESCs , 2 although iPSCs generation is technically still somewhat inefficient , once iPSCs colonies are formed , they can be expanded in vitro to large numbers , in contrast to adult stem cells , that normally possess very low self-renewal in vitro , and 3 iPSCs can be patient customized , because they can be generated from an easily accessible source , that is fibroblasts , obtain-able from any individual Figure 1 . Therefore , it is not surprising that many leading research groups , which for many years have contributed to ES cells research , have now turned their attention to iPSCs , and some doubts have been posed about the future of �normal� ES cell research.6,12,13 Although iPSCs opened up a new era in stem cell research , this breakthrough discovery is accompanied by new chal-lenges that need to be overcome to turn a �proof of concept � into a new possible therapeutic tool . At this stage , there are several problems to be addressed 1 the safety of the reprogramming process , 11 that so far has been done mainly through a genetic manipulation of the cell 2 the possible incomplete reprogramming , raising questions about the effective equivalence between iPS and ES cells 3 the epigenetic differences between ES and iPS cells , which may cause , among other consequences , a different differentiation potential and 4 the need of efficient methods to induce the differentiation of iPS or ES cells into the desired cell type , without undesired turnings , often leading into cancer . These major problems have been tackled in several ways , which will be outlined in this review . Actually , the primary concern about iPSCs is that they have been generated by transduction of somatic cells with retroviruses or lentiviruses , thus the transgenes used are integrated into the cell genome . Very recently , several approaches have been proposed to over-come this issue . In fact , iPSCs have been generated by transient expression of single nonviral polycistronic vectors , 14,15 by a Cre loxP recombination system , 16 by the piggyBac PB transposon system , 17,18 by nonintegrating episomal vectors , 19 and by recombinant proteins.20 However , the possibility of reprogramming cells by a chemical approach , that is by treating them with appropriate de-differentiating drugs , has been auspicated by many authors.21,22 In fact , chemical induction reprogramming has several intrinsic ad-vantages over genetic manipulation 1 timing , as drugs can usually reach their target s very quickly and selectively 2 control , as the concentration of the drug can be easily varied to reach the desired effect in the most efficient way 3 simplicity , as chemical treatments will allow a very simple tool , as compared with the use of retro-or lenti-vital systems and 4 low cost , as new drugs , once identified , can be easily synthesized in large scale by consolidated methods . Actually , chemical modulation of differentiation is not a new approach . In fact , many synthetic and natural products have been extensively used over the past decades , long before the development of combinatorial chemistry and high-throughput screening . Among others , it was shown over a decade ago that retinoic acid and its derivatives could be used to induce mouse ES cells to express multiple phenotypes normally associated with neurons.23 Another molecule , 5-azacytidine , a potent DNA methylation inhibitor , was first synthesized over 40 years ago , 24 and it was shown to have a wide range of anti-metabolic activities when tested against cultured cancer cells and to be an effective chemotherapeutic agent for acute myelogenous leukemia.25 More recently , it has been shown that in vitro treatment with 5-azacytidine , even if not enough to generate mature cardiomyocytes , promotes the in vivo and in vitro commitment of bone marrow cells into cells that express muscle-specific proteins and genes and , at a very low rate , show spontaneous contractions.26 Organic chemistry and cell biology have been working together as a single discipline for centuries , giving rise to many discoveries that greatly contributed to the progress of scientific research . Then , at the beginning of the past century , they split-up and started to grow on separate tracks , as they developed into independent sciences . However , in the past few years , many organic chemists are turning their attention to biological systems , including stem cell biology.21,27 In particular , new tools developed in organic chemistry , as combinatorial synthesis and high-throughput screening have been extensively used in both basic biology and drug discovery.28 This approach , which was originated by the solid-phase synthesis of peptides introduced by Merrifield in 1963,29 was greatly developed in the 1990s . Modern combinatorial synthesis allows the generation of so-called �libraries� of compounds , each containing an average of 40�100 thousands compounds . In the last decade , almost all pharmaceutical companies have been screening libraries to find new drug candidates , many of which are currently under advanced clinical trials , or have been already released like sorafenib , a multikinase inhibitor for the treatment of advanced renal cancer , approved for clinical use by FDA.30 In any case , as documented in this review , high-throughput screening has allowed the identification of several new compounds , which appear to possess a remarkable potential for stem cell biology.27 Chemistry and Cell Reprogramming The intricate process of cell differentiation , from ES cells to terminally differentiated somatic cells , has been depicted for years as a one-way multistep process . In fact , even in the case of tissue regeneration on damage , adult mammals can only use pre-existing progenitor cells , which are activated to proliferate and differentiate to replace the lost cells . On the other hand , a few examples coming from nature have puzzled scientists for several decades . For instance , amphibians like the salamander use a different mechanism for regeneration , because the stem cells used to repair the damage are generated in situ through the de-differentiation of adult cells.31 In fact , the salamander can fully regenerate its limbs by forming a so-called blastema , a mass of de-differentiated cells , which can proliferate and differentiate to regenerate the injured or even completely amputated body part . Several attempts have been made over the years to unleash the same de-differentiation process in mammalians , with the ultimate goal of generating stem cells from adult cells in vitro.32 These approaches include somatic cell nuclear transfer SCNT , often referred to as somatic cloning , 33�36 which not only raised numerous ethical debates , but so far has been shown to be too inefficient to be practicable.37 Other techniques include fusion of adult cells to ES cells38�40 and treatment of differentiated cells with newt blastema extracts , 41 but they have yet to be further developed . At the same time , a different strategy has been quite successful , the so-called trans-differentiation process , which consist of the direct reprogram-ming of a somatic cell into a different cell type , possibly without going back and forth in the differentiation hierarchy . For example , pancreatic cells have been successfully converted into hepatocytes by treatment with a synthetic glucocorticoid , dexamethasone , 42 or oligodendrocyte precursor cells could be reverted to multipotential neural stem cells , which could give rise to neurons and astrocytes , as well as to oligodendrocytes.43 Finally , a new chemical approach , which was pioneered by Schultz and coworkers , 44 and further developed by Ding and coworkers , 45,46 is the screening of combinatorial libraries of small molecules , with the ultimate goal of identifying target compounds that can induce the de-differentiation process.21 This method requires the design of very specific and quick screening assays that allow the identification of active compounds see Figure 2 for a list of several small molecules successfully used in stem cell biology from a pool of several thousands of random compounds . One initial screening by Schultz�s group led to the identification of myoseverin , a synthetic purine that has been shown to induce the quantitative and reversible fission of multinucleated myotubes into mononucleated fragments.47 Myoseverin , together with other structurally related compounds , inhibited the polymeri-zation of purified bovine tubuline in vitro . Both microtubule depolymerization activity and myotube disassembly were dependant on the presence of methoxy groups at the para-position of both benzyl rings , whereas methylation at the N6 position abolished activity Figure 2 . Myoblasts , derived from myotubes by myoseverin addition , could proliferate and redifferentiate into myotubes , although the molecule irrever-sibly binds to cells . Moreover , it was shown that the molecule affects gene expression , as myogenic differentiation markers were downregulated , whereas genes associated with cell proliferation were upregulated . However , in histone H1 phosphorylation assays , it was found that myoseverin did not inhibit CDK1 activity , indicating a different mechanism of action from other bioactive 2,6,9-trisubstituted purines.48 Although the obtained myoblasts could not be further de-differentiated into stem cells thus did not acquire pluripotency , this is , to the best of our knowledge , the first example of the reprogramming of a terminally differentiated cell by a synthetic small molecule . Successively , the same group designed a new high-throughput screen , and identified a new synthetic purine , which they named reversine , that could revert mouse proliferating myoblasts C2C12 to a more undifferentiated state , as they could be converted into adipocytes and osteoblasts when treated with appropriate differentiating media.44 These results , came out 2 years before the report of iPSCs and generated mixed reactions from the scientific community , which at that time was posing questions about the feasibility of the de-differentiation process . Nevertheless , several successive independent studies showed the potential of reversine , even on an easily accessible cell source as dermal fibroblasts.49 In particular , our group reported that primary cultures of murine and human dermal fibroblasts , after reversine treatment , could be efficiently induced to differentiate into myocytes both in vitro and in vivo , in a mouse regeneration model . Moreover , reversine-treated fibroblasts could be induced to differentiate into smooth muscle and bone cells in vitro49 Figure 3 . These results showed the soundness of a chemical approach toward cell reprogramming , and stimulated further developments . In fact , it has been recently shown that reversine-treated myoblasts , even at submicromolar concentrations , can be induced to differentiate toward the neuroectodermal lineage.50 Although reversine mechanism of action is still not fully understood , evidence seems to point to interactions with key proteins involved in cytoskeletal and cell shape remodeling , RNA export , degradation , folding , stress control , and ATP production.51 Moreover , reversine has been shown to inhibit MEK1 , the nonmuscular myosin heavy chain NMMII and some Aurora kinases , 52�54 leading some research groups to propose the use of the molecule as a new anti-cancer agent.55,56 As reversine seems to be a nonspecific kinase inhibitor due to its core structure , a modified purine , it may be argued that unpredictable or undesirable off-target effects may be expected.57 This concern may be real , and it is safe to say that reversine can be considered a tool to understand the reprogramming mechanism . In fact , it has also been shown that , at least in the case of C2C12 cells , specific inhibition of both MEK1 and NMMII by other means , is sufficient to mimic reversine reprogramming.52 More recently , the discovery of iPSCs has shown that adult cells can be induced to go back all the way to a pluripotent ES-like state . Although a �genetically driven� reprogramming process has been reproduced in several laboratories , little is known about the mechanisms involved in the induction.1,58,59 However , very recent data obtained by several laboratories established a link between the reprogramming process and p53 pathway , showing that disabling p53 , an essential tumor-suppressor protein , improves the efficiency of stem cell production.60�66 Moreover , as already pointed out , there are at least two major safety problems that need to be solved 1 the process is very slow , thus culturing cells in vitro for several weeks may result in genetic alterations 2 iPS are mostly generated by exogenous genetic manipulations , as the master genes are introduced by viral infection . Although a very recent report shows that iPSCs can be generated by transient technologies , without evidence of genomic integra-tion , this possibility can not be completely ruled out.67 It is in this scenario that a chemical approach may become crucial , and some initial results seem to suggest that we are quickly moving from what we may propose to call �genetically induced� pluripotent cells GiPS to a new generation of �chemically induced� pluripotent cells CiPS . In fact , very recent studies reported the generation of iPS by combining genetic reprogramming and small molecules.46,68,69 In particular , it has been shown that the combination of two small molecules , BIX-01294 , a known G9a histone methyltransferase inhibi-tor , 70,71 and BayK8644 , a L-channel calcium agonist , 72 together with the transduction with Oct3 4 and Klf4 , allows the reprogramming of mouse embryonic fibroblasts to iPSCs , 68 although with a lower efficiency 50 % lower as compared with transfection with the four factors OCT4 SOX2 Klf4 c-Myc . It is interesting to point out that BayK8644 does not directly modify the epigenetic status of the cell , in contrast to BIX and other small molecules known to affect cell reprogramming like valproic acid73 and 5-azacytidine , 74 which are known epigenetic drugs . This feature is very desirable for a candidate molecule to become a safe therapeutic drug . However , 5-azacytidine improves reprogramming efficiency by 10-fold , whereas valproic acid by 4100-fold.73 Further-more , valproic acid can substitute for oncogene c-Myc in the reprogramming process , with an efficiency that is superior to that achieved with infection all four factors.73 More recently , iPSCs from adult rat cells were also generated by genetic reprogramming with lentivirus containing a cocktail of repro-gramming factors , 75 and concomitantly it was also reported that rat iPSCs could be obtained with small molecules , in combination with genetic reprogramming.46 These results are of great interest , as bona fide rat ES cells have been so far isolated with great difficulty , and they do not show true pluripotency.76�79 In fact , when rat iPSCs are generated by viral transfection with the four factors OCT4 SOX2 Klf4 c-Myc , they quickly differentiate and lose ESC morphology , suggesting that conventional mESC medium conditions can not maintain the pluripotent state.46 On the other hand , when rat iPSCs were cultured in the presence of a cocktail containing LIF , PD0325901 a MEK inhibitor , A-83-01 an inhibitor of the type 1 TGFb receptor , and CHIR99021 a GSK3b inhibitor , they could be maintained for 430 passages without differentiation or decreased proliferation.46 In a different study , it has been reported that the combination of other chemical inhibitors targeting FGF receptor , MEK and GSK3 enables efficient derivation and propagation of germ-line-competent ES cells from the rat.80 Very recently , another small molecule was identified by a combinatorial screening , kenpaullone , which could be used instead of Klf4 to generate iPSCs that are indistinguishable from murine ESCs.69 However , it has been shown that kenpaullone�s activity does not result from its known role as a GSK-3b inhibitor , suggesting that the molecules function through a novel unknown mechanism.69 Taken together , all these results support the idea that small molecules are a crucial tool for the understanding of the intricate mechanisms that lead to cell reprogramming . More-over , small drugs have already shown their potential to effectively replace viral transduction of key transcription factors such as SOX2 , and KLF4 , suggesting that we may not be that far from generating iPSCs by chemical induction alone . A Chemical Approach to Cell Differentiation ESCs differentiation . Finding a safe and efficient way of generating stem cells is only half way through solving the problem . In fact , once progenitors cells are generated , it is crucial to have very selective and high-yielding methods to pilot their differentiation toward the desired cell phenotype . ES cells can be arguably considered the best starting point , because they possess pluripotency , as compared with adult stem cells that are only multipotent , because they normally have limited potential . However , ES cells , because of their tremendous potency , are difficult to control , as they spontaneously tend to differentiate into several cell types . Nevertheless , a number of successful differentiation approaches have been developed over the years , with increasingly successful results , as thoroughly summarized recently.81 One of the main problems , which has yet to be fully solved , is that even when induced to differentiate , some ES cells remain undifferentiated and may result in the formation of teratomas . Thus , ES cells can not be directly used for therapy , but they need to be pre-induced to differentiate in vitro , making sure to leave undifferentiated cells behind . In fact , to date , no human clinical trials have been approved yet , due to safety concerns , including the widely announced multicenter clinical trial by Geron http www.geron.com for grade A subacute thoracic spinal cord injuries , which has been put on hold by the FDA . Moreover , ES cells need to be grown in the presence of feeder cells and or extremely expensive cocktails of cytokines and growth factors . To further complicate the picture , it has been shown that human ES cells respond to extrinsic signals differently from mouse ES cell , 82,83 and are more similar to mouse epiSC post-implantation epiblast-derived stem cells than mouse ES cells.84 Thus , some differentiation strategies developed for mouse ES cells may not be directly extendable to human ES cells . At this stage , small molecules may have a primary function in the development of new strategies for human ES determination and differentiation . Undoubtedly , it would be really desirable to find small molecules that will replace or increase the efficacy of known key factors , including growth factors , cytokines , and WNT signaling pathway85 proteins . Several successful examples have already been reported . For instance , mouse ES cells have been induced to differentiate into spinal progenitor cells , and subsequently into motor neurons , with retinoic acid and the small molecule Hh-Ag1.3 , agonist of Shh signaling.86 In a different study , a phenotypic cell-based screen of a combinatorial chemical library for the activation of the rat atrial natriuretic factor led to the identification of a class of diaminopyrimidine compounds , cardiogenol A�D , which could selectively induce mouse ES cells to differentiate into cardiomyocytes , 87 although the mechanism of action is still unknown , and no further studies have been reported on this molecule . Nevertheless , it was reported that when mouse embryonic carcinoma cells P19 were treated with Cardiogenol C , they differentiated into beating cardiomyocytes in vitro , with B90 % of cells staining positive for MEF2 and Nkx2.5.87 More recently , it was shown that human ESC-derived embryoid bodies , which after induction with combinations of activin A , bone morphogenetic protein 4 , basic fibroblast growth factor , vascular endothelial growth factor , and dickkopf homolog 1 in serum-free media , generate a KDR low C-KIT CD117 neg population that displays cardiac , endothelial , and vascular smooth muscle potential in vitro and , after transplantation , in vivo.88 Very recently , mouse cardiac progenitor cells could be derived from ES cells with high efficiency by addition of cyclosporin A to embryoid bodies.89 Moreover , these cardiac progenitors , transplanted in a chronic myocardial infarction model of rat , successfully differentiated into cardiomyocytes and integrated in the infarcted heart . Recently , in a screen of 4000 compounds , two cell-permeable small molecules were identified that direct differentiation of ESCs into the endodermal lineage.90 These compounds induce nearly 80 % of ESCs to form definitive endoderm , a higher efficiency than that achieved by Activin A or Nodal , commonly used protein inducers of endoderm . Altogether , these results show that a chemical approach to stem cell differentiation has started to become very effective , as many chemicals are emerging as potentially good and cheaper alternatives to growth factors . Adult stem cells differentiation . Adult stem cells , differently than ES cells , are only multipotent , because they can normally be differentiated into a limited number of cell types , usually inherent to the tissue where they reside . Therefore , they are considered a safer starting point as compared with ES cells , particularly because they are not prone to form teratomas as in the case of ES cells . Moreover , adult stem cells do not encounter the same ethical obstacles of ES cells , thus explaining their faster development , as confirmed by NIH database http www.clinicaltrial.gov , which lists over a thousand adult stem cells-connected ongoing clinical trials . Indeed , although thousands of successful differentiations have been reported in the literature , especially in the case of mesenchymal stem cells , 91 we are still far from highly efficient differentiation methods , as it would be required for an effective therapeutic tool.92,93 In fact , although each different type of adult stem cell should be considered alone , there are some general problems associated to their use 1 they usually can be obtained in very small numbers from adult individuals 2 they can only be grown for a limited number of passages in vitro before losing their differentiation potential and 3 the yields of differentiation are often too low to be practical for a therapeutic use . As in the case of ES cells , differentiation of adult stem cells is obtained ex vivo with cocktails of growth factors and signaling molecules . Furthermore , some recently discovered adult stem cells , like neural stem cells94 or cardiac progenitor cells , 95 possess a very limited turnover , thus new chemically defined growth conditions have been recently developed.96 To give a very interesting recent example of chemically induced differentiation of adult stem cells , it has been reported that a synthetic sulfonylhydrazone Shz1 , found in a combinatorial library screen for the activation of NKX2.5 , can trigger cardiac differentiation of human mobilized peripheral blood mononuclear cells , and these in vitro generated human cardiac cells can engraft into a rat heart in proximity to an experimental injury , improving cardiac function.97 The improvement of current differentiation methods is mandatory , and cell-based phenotypic assays and or pathway screens of synthetic molecules promise to provide new possibilities for more selective and efficient differentiations.21,27,96 Conclusions and Perspectives The generation of pluripotent cells from adult cells is undoubtedly a keystone achievement in stem cell biology . This discovery has allowed the scientific community to overcome one of the most debated ethical issues of our times , the disruption of embryos for the generation of human ES cells . This new fascinating path has already shown its potential , but at the same time , it already posed new challenges to scientist around the world . A chemical approach for the generation of stem cells from adult cells has been invoked as a safer and more convenient alternative to genetic manipulation , which is widely used to generate iPSCs today . Very recent advances have already shown that the goal is getting closer , 71 and we may envision the possibility of easily generating stem cells customized to the patient , which will open new perspective in both regenerative medicine and drug discovery . In fact , the �short-term� application of iPSCs may be to use them for drug discovery or toxicology screens in vitro . Moreover , they can allow the generation of disease models in culture , starting from patient cells , which would allow to test patient-specific therapies . We are at the beginning of a new exciting era in stem cell biology , there are great expectations and a remarkable potential ahead of us , and the best has yet to come .

20168333	JK Son1 , S Varadarajan1,2,3 and SB Bratton* , 1,2 The tumor necrosis factor TNF family of cytokines has critical roles in inflammation and immune surveillance.1 Among them , TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand TRAIL also known as Apo2L has emerged as a promising anticancer therapy , because of its remarkable capacity to induce apoptosis programmed cell death in cancer cells with little to no toxicity to normal cells.2 Membrane-bound TRAIL initiates the extrinsic death receptor pathway in target cells by binding to its trimerized receptors , TRAIL-R1 and TRAIL-R2 also known as DR4 and DR5 , resulting in receptor aggregation and recruitment of the adapter protein Fas-associated death domain FADD and procaspase-8 . This complex of TRAIL receptors , FADD , and procaspase-8 is often referred to as the �death inducing signaling complex� DISC , and recruitment of procaspase-8 to the DISC leads to its dimerization and subsequent activation.3 In some cells designated type I cells , the apoptotic signal from active caspase-8 is sufficient to activate the downstream effector procaspase-3 and induce apoptosis . However , in other cells designated type II cells , there is insufficient activation of procaspase-3 � or caspase-3 is inhibited by an inhibitor-of-apoptosis IAP protein such as X-linked IAP XIAP � and hence the apoptotic signal must be further amplified by engaging the intrinsic mitochondrial pathway.4,5 In this instance , caspase-8 cleaves and activates the BH3-only protein BID , which in turn activates the proapoptotic BCL-2 family members , BAX or BAK , and induces mitochon-drial outer membrane permeabilization MOMP . After MOMP , additional apoptogenic proteins are released into the cytoplasm , including the IAP antagonist , second mito-chondrial activator of caspases Smac also known as DIABLO , and cytochrome c , the latter of which activates yet another caspase-activating complex , known as the Apaf-1K caspase-9 apoptosome . In addition to inducing apoptosis , TRAIL receptor stimula-tion also leads to activation of various signaling pathways , including activation of the IkB kinase IKK complex , mitogen-activated protein kinases MAPKs , and c-Jun N-terminal kinases JNKs .6�8 Although not required for apoptosis , TRAIL receptors reportedly undergo internalization and caspase-8-dependent formation of a secondary signaling complex.6,9 This intracellular complex contains receptor-interacting protein 1 RIP1 and TNF receptor-associated factor 2 TRAF2 , which then signal for the activation of IKK and the stress kinases , p38 MAPKs and JNKs , through ill-defined mechanisms.6 Notably , TNF induces robust activa-tion of these pathways , and in particular , activation of the transcription factor NF-kB by IKK suppresses TNF-induced apoptosis in most cell types through upregulation of various antiapoptotic genes.10 TRAIL , in comparison , generally activates these pathways to a lesser extent and their importance in regulating TRAIL-induced cell death remains unclear.6 Despite its promise as an anticancer agent , a significant problem associated with TRAIL-based therapy is that many tumors possess or acquire resistance to TRAIL . Expression of TRAIL �decoy� receptors , TRAIL-R3 and TRAIL-R4 , has been proposed to mediate TRAIL resistance by competing with TRAIL-R1 and TRAIL-R2 for TRAIL , 11 and at high expression levels , cellular FLICE-like inhibitory protein c-FLIP inhibits apoptosis by competing with caspase-8 for binding to FADD.12,13 Finally , overexpression of antiapoptotic BCL-2 family members , including BCL-2 , BCL-xL , and MCL-1 , is associated with TRAIL resistance , 14�16 particularly in type II cells , because of their abilities to prevent MOMP and the release of cytochrome c or Smac DIABLO.4 Gene ablation studies indicate that MCL-1 is essential for peri-implantation , the development and maintenance of B and T lymphocytes , and the survival of hematopoietic cells.17,18 MCL-1 is highly regulated at the transcriptional level in hematopoietic cells through the transcription factors SRF ETS , STAT3 , CREB , and PU.1,19�22 and at the post-translational level through a complex interplay involving three kinases ERK , JNK , and GSK-3b and at least two E3 ubiquitin ligases MCL-1 ubiquitin ligase E3 MULE and b-TrCP .23�28 ERK-mediated phosphorylation of human MCL-1 at Thr-163 prolongs its half-life , 25 although recent studies by Davis and colleagues27,28 indicate that JNK phosphorylates mouse MCL-1 at Thr-144 analogous to Thr-163 in human MCL-1 , which in turn enhances its phosphorylation by GSK-3b at Ser-140.28 GSK-3b-mediated phosphorylation of mouse human MCL-1 at Ser-140 Ser-159 then promotes its ubiquitina-tion by E3 ligases and subsequent degradation by the 26S proteasome . In this study , we explored the mechanisms responsible for TRAIL resistance in prostate cancer cells . Remarkably , we found that TRAIL activates a TGF-b-activated kinase 1 TAK1 -MKK3 MKK6-p38 pathway that transcriptionally upregulates the expression of MCL-1 and suppresses BAK activation , MOMP , and cell death , despite caspase-8 activa-tion and robust BID cleavage . Disruption of the p38 MAPK signaling pathway downregulated MCL-1 and sensitized cells to TRAIL-induced MOMP and apoptosis . However , reactive oxygen species ROS , generated by injured mitochondria , activated a secondary JNK pathway in some cells that upregulated MCL-1 expression and afforded partial protection from death . Thus , we show for the first time that stress kinases activated by TRAIL at distinct steps in the extrinsic pathway mediate TRAIL resistance through maintenance of MCL-1 expression levels . TRAIL activates an antiapoptotic TAK1-MKK3 MKK6-p38 MAPK signaling pathway in resistant prostate cancer cells . In an effort to determine the mechanism s of TRAIL resistance in human prostate cancer cells , DU145 cells were exposed to recombinant TRAIL and examined for activation of various stress and growth-related kinases Figure 1a . Notably , p38-a and its downstream target , MAPK-activated protein kinase 2 MK2 , were phosphorylated within 2 h of treatment before cell death , whereas other stress kinases , such as JNKs , were only weakly activated at later time points Figure 1a . ERKs were constitutively active in naive cells , but TRAIL did not enhance their activation , nor did it activate AKT PKB Figure 1a data not shown . The importance of p38-a activation was evident when cells were cotreated with TRAIL and the selective p38-a and p38-b inhibitor , SB203580 , as the combination led to a significant increase in apoptosis Figure 1b . TRAIL activated the initiator caspase-8 and the effector caspase-3 as determined by caspase processing and DEVDase activity , particularly in the presence of SB203580 Figure 1c . Cell death was fully inhibited by benzyloxy-carbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-OMe fluoromethyl ketone z-VAD-fmk however , this polycaspase inhibitor had no effect on the activation of p38-a , further establishing p38-a activation as an early upstream event Figures 1b and c , top panel , lanes 5�8 . This was an important observation , because although few studies have addressed how TRAIL activates p38-a , the adapter protein RIP1 and caspase-8 activity were previously thought to be essential.6 The sensitization of DU145 cells to TRAIL was due to the specific inhibition of p38 MAPKs , as transfection with a constitutively active form of p38-a CA largely rescued cells from TRAIL SB203580-induced cell death , but only when accompanied by a mutation in the �gate-keeper� residue T106M , which lowers the affinity of SB203580 for the ATP-binding pocket Figures 1d�f .29 As TNF reportedly activates p38-a through the activation of TAK1 or apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 ASK1 , 30,31 we next sought to determine whether either of these MAP3Ks was essential for TRAIL-mediated activation of p38-a . Exposure of DU145 cells to TRAIL resulted in the phosphor-ylation activation of TAK1 within B30�60 min , before or concomitant with activation of p38-a Figures 1a and g , inset , and did so in a caspase-independent manner Figure 1h , lanes 1 , 2 , and 4 , whereas ASK1 failed to undergo phosphorylation at Thr-845 data not shown . 5Z-7-oxozeae-nol , a resorcylic lactone of fungal origin , has been reported to selectively inhibit TAK1.32 Therefore , we pretreated cells with 5Z-7-oxozeaenol and found that it inhibited TRAIL-induced activation of TAK1 and p38-a Figure 1h , lanes 1�3 and 5 , and correspondingly , potentiated TRAIL-induced apoptosis at levels comparable to TRAIL plus SB203580 Figure 1g . Finally , to confirm our results with 5Z-7-oxozeaenol , we determined the effects of dominant-negative TAK1 and p38-a mutants on TRAIL-induced activation of p38-a and apoptosis in DU145 cells Figure 1i . Dominant-negative MKK3 and MKK6 mutants were also examined , as these two MAP2Ks have redundant but essential roles in TNF-dependent activa-tion of p38 MAPKs.33 As expected , disruption of the TAK1 - MKK3 MKK6-p38 MAPK pathway , at any step , suppressed the phosphorylation activation of p38-a and resulted in significant sensitization of cells to TRAIL-induced cell death Figure 1i . p38 MAPKs suppress TRAIL-induced apoptosis down-stream of the DISC by inhibiting MOMP and the release of Smac DIABLO . Our initial results suggested a model in which TRAIL receptor stimulation resulted in the activation of p-p38 ? p-MK2 p-JNK p-ERK Control TRAIL SB203580 TRAIL+SB 5Z-7-oxo TRAIL+ 5Z-7-oxo a pro-survival TAK1-MKK3 MKK6-p38 MAPK pathway and a pro-death TRAIL-R1 TRAIL-R2-FADD-caspase-8 pathway Figure 2a . It remained unclear , however , precisely how p38-a activation prevented apoptosis . To address this question , we first analyzed the effects of SB203580 on formation of the TRAIL DISC . As shown in Figure 2b , SB203580 had no effect on recruitment of the adapter protein FADD to TRAIL-R2 , or the subsequent recruitment and activation of the initiator procaspase-8 . Cell surface T106M Control TRAIL expression of TRAIL-R1 was very low when compared with TRAIL-R2 , such that only TRAIL-R2 was detected within the DISC data not shown . As previously noted , c-FLIP overexpression can inhibit the activation of procaspase-8 within the DISC and is often cited as a cause of TRAIL resistance . However , SB203580 had no effect on the basal levels of c-FLIP in whole lysates Figure 2c , compare lanes 1 and 2 , and despite repeated attempts , c-FLIP could not be detected within the DISC Figure 2b . In contrast , an examination of mitochondria revealed that inhibition of p38 MAPKs was required for TRAIL-induced MOMP , as determined by the mitochondrial release of cytochrome c and Smac DIABLO into the cytosol and a loss in mitochondrial inner membrane potential Dcm Figure 2d . Cytochrome c induces formation of the apoptosome and sequential activation of caspases-9 and -3.34 . However , in the case of death receptor stimulation , it is often the release of Smac DIABLO , rather than cytochrome c , that is critical for cell killing.4 In these instances , active caspase-8 processes procaspase-3 , but caspase-3 is inhibited by IAPs , and cytosolic Smac DIABLO is required to antagonize IAPs and relieve the inhibition of caspase-3.4 We therefore stably infected cells with a lentivirus expressing dominant-negative caspase-9 C287A , a potent inhibitor of the apoptosome , 34 or transiently transfected cells with a ubiquitin-Smac DIABLO fusion construct that produces mature cytosolic Smac DIABLO.35 Overexpression of dominant-negative caspase-9 had no effect on TRAIL SB203580-induced apoptosis in DU145 cells Figure 2e , although it clearly inhibited the activation of endogenous caspase-9 in cytochrome c dATP-activated lysates Figure 2f . Smac DIABLO , on the other hand , potentiated TRAIL-induced cell death , even in the absence of SB203580 Figure 2g . A recent study suggests that loss of XIAP can sensitize BID-deficient hepatocytes and pancreatic b-cells to FasL CD95L-induced apoptosis in vivo , essentially phenocopying MOMP and the release of Smac DIABLO.36 However , SB203580 had no effect on the expression levels of XIAP Figure 2h , lanes 1 and 2 . Thus , the TAK1-MKK3 MKK6-p38 MAPK pathway seemed to suppress TRAIL-induced apoptosis in large part by preventing MOMP and the release of Smac p38 MAPKs inhibit TRAIL-induced MOMP , in spite of BID activation , through transcriptional upregulation of MCL-1 . Death receptors normally engage the mitochondrial pathway through caspase-8-dependent cleavage and activation of the proapoptotic BH3-only protein BID.37 Although controversial , truncated BID tBID and other BH3-only proteins then directly activate the multidomain proapoptotic BCL-2 family members , BAX or BAK direct activation model , and or antagonize the antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family members , BCL-2 , BCL-xL , or MCL-1 , thereby relieving their inhibition of BAX or BAK indirect activation model .38,39 We treated DU145 cells with TRAIL�SB203580 and examined them for BID cleavage and downstream BAK activation . Remarkably , exposure to TRAIL alone induced near-complete BID cleavage Figure 3a , lane 5 , but in the absence of SB203580 , tBID failed to induce the conformational change in BAK required for its activation Figure 3b , compare TRAIL with TRAIL ? SB . Thus , consistent with our previous DISC results , TRAIL receptor stimulation induced significant caspase-8 activation and BID cleavage , but tBID was unable to induce BAK oligomerization and MOMP unless the antiapoptotic p38 MAPK pathway was disrupted Figures 2b and d 3a and b . Given the aforementioned results , we considered that p38 MAPKs might regulate the expression of BCL-2 , BCL-xL , or MCL-1 . Indeed , after treatment with SB203580 , basal MCL-1 but not BCL-2 or BCL-xL expression levels were reduced , both at the protein and transcriptional levels Figure 3c , lanes 1 and 2 Figure 3d , whereas TRAIL treatment alone led to an increase in MCL-1 expression Figure 3c , lanes 1 and 3 Figure 3d . Surprisingly , when used in combination , MCL-1 levels were largely maintained , but it was important to note that these assays were performed at 8 h , when the combina-tion of TRAIL plus SB203580 induced significant apoptosis Figure 3c , lane 4 Figure 3d . Subsequent time course experiments revealed that SB203580 suppressed the basal and upregulated expression of MCL-1 by TRAIL during the MKK3 MKK6 Casp-8 bTRAIL first 2�3 h of treatment and that MCL-1 levels did not rebound until later X4 h after the activation of caspases Figure 3e , lanes 4�8 Figure 3f . To confirm that the loss of MCL-1 expression was due to a decrease in transcription and was not the result of an increase in protein turnover , we transiently expressed MCL-1 from a CMV promoter and followed the turnover of MCL-1 in the presence of cycloheximide , an inhibitor of protein synthesis . As ERK-dependent phosphor-ylation of MCL-1 at Thr-163 has been shown to regulate the turnover of MCL-1,25 we compared the effects of SB203580 with the ERK inhibitor U0126 . As shown in Figure 3g , whereas treatment with U0126 led to rapid turnover of MCL-1 lower panels , inhibition of p38 MAPKs with SB203580 had no such effect upper panels . Thus , collectively , the data argued strongly that p38 MAPK activity regulated the expression of MCL-1 at the transcriptional level . We next confirmed the importance of MCL-1 for mediating TRAIL resistance using several approaches . First , we found that ectopic expression of EGFP-MCL-1 significantly inhibited cell death induced by TRAIL plus SB203580 Figure 3h , whereas selective downregulation of endogenous MCL-1 by RNA interference RNAi sensitized cells to TRAIL alone , at a level comparable to scrambled control cells treated with TRAIL plus SB203580 Figure 3i . Second , as the BH3-only proteins , NOXA and BAD , selectively antagonize MCL-1 and BCL-2 BCL-xL BCL-w , respectively , 40 we expressed NOXA or BAD as mCherry fusion proteins and found that only NOXA sensitized DU145 cells to TRAIL Figure 3j . Thus , although TRAIL receptor stimulation led to near-complete cleavage of BID , the intracellular concentration of tBID was apparently insufficient to fully antagonize MCL-1 and alleviate the inhibition of BAK by MCL-1 or alternatively , MCL-1 seques-tered all of the available tBID and prevented its activation of BAK . Perhaps more consistent with the latter interpretation , knockdown of MCL-1 by RNAi failed to induce spontaneous BAK activation , whereas treatment of MCL-1-deficient cells with TRAIL alone which triggered BID cleavage induced significant BAK activation , similar to that observed in TRAIL SB203580-treated vector control cells compare Figure 3k with b . Similarly , ectopic expression of NOXA alone failed to induce apoptosis Figure 3j , whereas overexpression of tBID alone induced apoptosis , and when combined with SB203580 which inhibited basal p38 activity and downregulated basal MCL-1 levels , killed B90 % of transfected cells Figure 3l . In short , the data indicated that disruption of the TAK1-MKK3 MKK6-p38 MAPK pathway , after TRAIL receptor stimula-tion , prevented the upregulation of MCL-1 and facilitated tBID-induced BAK activation , MOMP , and cell death . Inhibition of p38 MAPKs potentiates TRAIL-induced apoptosis in BAX-expressing and androgen receptor-positive prostate cancer cells . Although downregulation of MCL-1 by SB203580 sensitized DU145 cells to TRAIL , these prostate cancer cells do not express BAX , the androgen receptor , or prostate-specific antigen , all of which are commonly observed in primary prostate cancers.41,42 We therefore expanded our studies to include DU145 cells , stably transfected with BAX , and LNCaP prostate cancer cells , which naturally express both BAX and BAK and are androgen receptor and prostate-specific antigen positive.41,42 As shown in Figure 4a , re-expression of BAX in DU145 cells sensitized them to TRAIL , but cotreatment with SB203580 still resulted in a further increase in cell death . This observation was not surprising given that MCL-1 sequesters tBID , and tBID is reportedly required to activate both BAK and BAX.39 LNCaP cells also showed resistance to TRAIL , and inhibition of p38 MAPKs with SB203580 similarly downregulated MCL-1 expression and sensitized these cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis Figures 4b and c . TRAIL-induced MOMP activates a ROS-dependent JNK pathway that upregulates MCL-1 expression and partially rescues cells from apoptosis . As already noted , SB203580 inhibited TRAIL-activated p38 MAPKs , thereby preventing the expression of MCL-1 in DU145 cells during the first 2�3 h after treatment with TRAIL and sensitized the cells to apoptosis Figures 1 and 3e . MCL-1 expression levels , however , partially rebounded X4 h later , concomitant with caspase activation Figures 3e and f data not shown . To characterize this resurgence in MCL-1 expression and to assess its potential effect on cell death , we treated DU145 cells with TRAIL�SB203580 and once again assayed them for the activation of several kinases , including JNKs , ERKs , and AKT . Interestingly , JNKs were robustly activated , as determined by autophosphorylation and downstream phosphorylation of c-Jun , but only in cells cotreated with TRAIL plus SB203580 Figure 5a , lane 4 Figure 5b , lane 4 . More importantly , a cell-permeable peptide inhibitor of JNK derived from JNK interaction protein inhibited JNK activity Figure 5e inset , lanes 3 and 4 , prevented entirely the rebound in MCL-1 expression Figure 5c , lanes 6 and 8 Figure 5d , and further sensitized the cells to apoptosis Figure 5e compare TRAIL ? SB ? JIP with TRAIL ? SB , Po0.05 . In contrast , in LNCaP cells , JNK activity was not upregulated after treatment with TRAIL plus SB203580 Figure 5b , lane 8 , MCL-1 levels failed to fully rebound Figure 4c , and LNCaP cells were correspondingly more sensitive to apoptosis than DU145 cells Figure 4b , TRAIL ? SB Po0.05 . ROS have been implicated in the TNF-dependent activation of JNKs through activation of ASK1 and or inhibition of MAPK phosphatases MKPs , 31,43 leading us to speculate that TRAIL might similarly stimulate the production of ROS and activate JNKs . Indeed , TRAIL treatment triggered the gen-eration of ROS in DU145 cells , but only in the presence of SB203580 Figure 6a , and the ROS scavenger , catalase , inhibited both the activation of JNKs and the resurgence in MCL-1 expression Figure 6c , lanes 6 and 7 . In contrast , TRAIL plus SB203580 failed to stimulate the production of ROS in LNCaP cells , in accordance with its inability to activate JNK in these cells Figures 5b and 6b . Given that caspase-dependent cleavage of BID and downregulation of MCL-1 was required to induce MOMP after exposure to TRAIL plus SB203580 Figure 3 and that mitochondrial perturbation often leads to the production of ROS , 44 we speculated that mitochondrial-generated ROS might be responsible for the activation of JNKs . As predicted , in DU145 cells , inhibition of caspases with z-VAD-fmk inhibited the production of ROS , the activation of JNKs , and the resurgence in MCL-1 expression after treatment with TRAIL plus SB203580 Figure 6c , lanes 6 and 8 Figure 6d . However , TNF reportedly stimulates ROS production up-stream of mitochondria.31,43,45 Therefore , rather than inhibiting the cleavage of all caspase-8 substrates , some of which might theoretically mediate ROS production upstream of mitochon-dria , we instead knocked down the expression of BID to U0126 -- + + + ---- % VC Noxa Bad TRAIL+VC TRAIL+Noxa TRAIL+Bad TRAIL 100 101 102 103 Lane 1 2 3 4 ? -Bak N-terminus selectively prevent tBID-induced MOMP . Remarkably , partial depletion of BID was sufficient to suppress TRAIL SB203580-induced mitochondrial injury as determined by Dcm and the generation of ROS Figures 6e and f , whereas knockdown of MCL-1 sensitized cells to TRAIL alone , resulting in a loss in Dcm with a concomitant increase in ROS Figures 6g and h . Finally , to this point , all of our ROS assays were performed controlSB 4hSB 8h SB 24h TRAIL+SB TRAIL+SB 4h 8h EGFP EGFP-Mcl-1 Actin SB TRAIL SB TRAIL+SB TRAILTRAIL+SB 75 Number Control Cell using an oxidant-sensitive fluorescent dye , DCFDA 20,70-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate , which is largely cytoso-lic . Therefore , to more directly assay mitochondria for ROS production , we transfected cells with a mitochondrial-localized circularly permuted yellow fluorescent protein , inserted into the regulatory domain of the oxidant-sensitive E. coli transcription factor OxyR pHyPer-Mito .46 As shown in Figures 6i and j , control cells and those treated with SB203580 or TRAIL alone showed little activation of the pHyPer-Mito probe . In stark contrast , cells cotreated with TRAIL plus SB203580 � a combination that induced MOMP , cytochrome c release , and a loss in Dcm Figure 2d � showed a profound increase in mitochondrial fluorescence Figures 6i and j . Taken together , the data in DU145 cells supported a model in which TRAIL plus SB203580 induced BID activation and downregulation of MCL-1 , resulting in MOMP , cytochrome c release , a loss in Dcm , increased ROS production , activation of JNKs , and ultimately , a resurgence in the expression of MCL-1 Figure 7 . Thus , even during times of profound stress , for example , after mitochondrial injury , the affected cells initiated a complex secondary survival pathway that con-verged upon MCL-1 , reemphasizing the importance of MCL-1 as a regulator of TRAIL-induced cell death . Discussion TNF activates various antiapoptotic signaling pathways that typically subvert an otherwise proapoptotic extrinsic pathway , resulting in minimal if any death in most cell types.10 TRAIL , in comparison , induces apoptosis selectively in tumor cells , but unfortunately B50 % of tumors possess or acquire resistance to TRAIL . Previous studies have shown that TRAIL , similar to TNF , activates ERK , JNK , and p38 MAPKs , but the magnitude of the responses is generally modest , and it remains unclear whether these pathways have significant roles in mediating TRAIL resistance . In this study , we have shown for the first time that stimulation of TRAIL receptors activates a TAK1-MKK3 MKK6-p38 MAPK pathway in prostate cancer cells that is largely responsible for the transcriptional upregulation of MCL-1 and subsequent resis-tance to apoptosis Figures 1 , 3 , and 4 . Importantly , exposure to SB203580 had no effect on c-FLIP expression levels , and TRAIL treatment alone led to robust DISC formation , caspase-8 activation , and near-complete BID cleavage , ruling out a prominent role for c-FLIP in mediating TRAIL resistance Figure 2 . Endogenous tBID however did not induce apoptosis unless MCL-1 expression levels were downregu-lated through simultaneous inhibition of the TRAIL-activated p38 pathway , knockdown of MCL-1 by RNAi , or antagonism of MCL-1 by ectopically expressed NOXA Figure 3 . The fact that overexpression of tBID could induce apopto-sis , whereas NOXA could not , suggests that there was simply insufficient generation of endogenous tBID after TRAIL treatment to fully antagonize MCL-1 and directly activate BAK . However , our data do not fully exclude either the direct or indirect activation models as previously posited , and indeed , recent studies suggest that these models are not mutually exclusive , in that BIM which similar to tBID is proposed to be a �direct activator� antagonizes antiapoptotic BCL-2 family members and directly activates BAX in vivo.47 Regardless , our studies reveal the critical importance of maintaining MCL-1 expression levels to suppress TRAIL-induced apoptosis , a fact that is further emphasized by our discovery that even after MOMP , mitochondrial-generated ROS stimulated a secondary JNK pathway that also transcriptionally upregulated the expression of MCL-1 and partially rescued a fraction of DU145 cells from death Figures 5 and 6 . It remains unclear why TRAIL plus SB203580 did not trigger the production of ROS or engage the secondary ROS-JNK-MCL-1 pathway in LNCaP cells . However , in DU145 cells , mitochondria were clearly the source of ROS , as caspase-8 inhibition and BID knockdown suppressed whereas MCL-1 knockdown enhanced losses in Dcm and ROS production Figure 6 . Mitochondrial-generated ROS are most likely produced at complex III , because of inefficient electron transfer after the release of cytochrome c , or perhaps at complex I , because of caspase-dependent cleavage of NDUFS4 Figure 7 .44 The notion that cells may survive after MOMP is controversial in cancer cells , although normal postmitotic neurons and cardiomyocytes seem to survive MOMP so long as caspases are inhibited.48 We can not rule out the possibility that low levels of tBID might induce mild injury to mitochondria , in a small fraction of cells , resulting in Apoptosis 40 SB Control ROS production , JNK activation , and upregulation of MCL-1 , before or in the absence of frank rupture of the outer mitochondrial membrane . Irrespective , our results are in stark contrast to TNF signaling , in which ROS are produced by NADPH oxidases upstream of mitochondria and in turn activate ASK-1 or inactivate MKPs , resulting in prolonged JNK activation , MOMP , and apoptosis.31,43,45 At this stage , the transcription factor s responsible for p38-a and JNK-dependent upregulation of MCL-1 , after treatment with TRAIL and TRAIL plus SB203580 , respectively , remain unknown and are currently under investigation . STAT3 and PU.1 have previously been implicated in MCL-1 expression however , PU.1 is generally restricted to hematopoietic tissues , and dominant-negative mutants of STAT1 , STAT3 , and ATF2 a p38-a and JNK-targeted transcription factor failed to potentiate TRAIL-induced apoptosis data not shown . Finally , there are several clinical implications that arise from our studies , particularly related to the use of small-molecule BCL-2 antagonists and Smac mimetics . There is currently legitimate excitement surrounding the use of BCL-2 antago-nists , such as ABT-737 , in the treatment of tumors made resistant to conventional chemotherapy through overexpres-sion of antiapoptotic BCL-2 family members . Similar to BAD , however , ABT-737 selectively targets BCL-2 , BCL-xL , and BCL-w , but not MCL-1 , and thus is unlikely to synergize with TRAIL in the treatment of MCL-1-overexpressing tumors . One potential approach for bypassing the antiapoptotic BCL-2 family members altogether could be to use Smac mimetics , which antagonize IAPs and liberate active caspases-3 and -7 after their initial processing by caspase-8 . Indeed , consistent with previous studies in other cancer cell types , from our laboratory and others , we found that release of Smac rather than cytochrome c was essential for TRAIL-induced apoptosis in DU145 prostate cancer cells Figure 2 . Smac mimetics however reportedly induce apoptosis by stimulating autoubiquitination and degradation of cellular IAP1 cIAP1 and cIAP2 , resulting in activation of the noncanonical NF-kB pathway and upregulation of TNF . Consequently , it remains unclear how effective these agents will be in vivo or whether they will show significant side effects due to the production of TNF . Our studies suggest that TRAIL might instead be used effectively in combination with clinically available p38 MAPK inhibitors for the treatment of cancers expressing MCL-1 .

TRAIL stimulates its receptors , TRAIL-R1 and or TRAIL-R2 , resulting in recruitment of the adapter protein FADD and activation of procaspase-8 within the DISC . Caspase-8 subsequently processes procaspase-3 , but active caspase-3 is rapidly inhibited by IAPs , including XIAP . Caspase-8 also cleaves and activates BID , and tBID would normally induce BAK-dependent MOMP and release the IAP antagonist Smac DIABLO . However , TRAIL receptor stimulation simultaneously activates an antiapoptotic TAK1-MKK3 MKK6-p38 MAPK signaling pathway that transcrip-tionally upregulates MCL-1 , which in turn sequesters neutralizes tBID . Disruption of this signaling pathway at any step sensitizes cells to TRAIL , but remarkably , even after mitochondrial injury , mitochondrial-generated ROS activate a secondary JNK pathway that similarly leads to transcriptional upregulation of MCL-1 and partial protection from cell death . As shown in the inset , ROS are most likely produced as a result of inefficient electron transfer , after the release of cytochrome c , or perhaps in response to caspase-dependent cleavage of complex I proteins including 
20203689	www.nature.com cdd Apoptosis is a form of cell death required for homeostasis of human tissues . Apoptotic cells display several morphological and biochemical changes , which are a consequence of the activity of caspase proteases.1 Caspases are normally inactive in the cytosol , but they become activated by dimerization and or proteolysis by other caspases . �Execu-tioner� caspases such as caspase-3 are activated through cleavage by �initiator� or �apical� caspases , of which the best characterized are caspases-8 and -9 . Caspase-8 is activated by its recruitment to the multimeric DISC death-inducing signaling complex in response to extracellular ligands such as Fas CD95-ligand , TRAIL or TNF 2 this is the death receptor , or extrinsic pathway of apoptosis . Caspase-9 is activated by dimerization after recruitment to the apoptosome , a complex of APAF1 proteins formed in response to the release of the mitochondrial protein cytochrome c into the cytosol.3 This caspase activation cascade is called the mitochondrial or intrinsic pathway of apoptosis . The mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis is regulated by proteins of the Bcl-2 family , which regulate the integrity of the mitochondrial outer membrane , thereby controlling cytochrome c and subsequent caspase activation.4 Impair-ment of the mitochondrial pathway is common in human tumors . Cancer cells frequently overexpress the antiapoptotic proteins Bcl-2 , Bcl-xL and Mcl-1 , or they lack functional proapoptotic Bcl-2 family members , including Bax , Bak or both.5 The overexpression of antiapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins not only blocks the morphological features of apoptosis , but also enables clonogenic cell survival.6 For these reasons , cells from Bax , Bak double-knockout DKO mice are a suitable model to identify non-mitochondrial pathways of cell death , which may be targeted for therapy . Bax Bak-deficient murine embryonic fibroblasts MEFs are resistant to apoptosis induced by stimuli that normally kill cells through the mitochondrial pathway.7,8 However , some drugs such as staurosporine , etoposide , thapsigargin and tunica-mycin , which kill wild-type WT cells in a mitochondria-dependent manner , can kill Bax - , Bak-deficient cells by a slower , non-apoptotic mechanism.9,10 We analyzed cell death induced by glucose deprivation in these cells , as this stimulus has been shown to kill some cell lines through necrosis.11,12 We report here that glucose deprivation can induce death of Bax - , Bak-deficient MEFs . Surprisingly , in these cells glucose deprivation induces apoptosis that proceeds through an unconventional pathway requiring caspase-8 . Our results uncover a pathway for activation of caspase-8 different than death receptor ligation , and provide new insight into the mechanism of cell death induced by nutrient deprivation . Results Glucose deprivation kills Bax - , Bak-deficient cells by apoptosis . Glucose deprivation has been shown to kill cells either by necrosis11,12 or through the mitochondrial or �intrinsic� pathway of apoptosis.13�17 We reasoned that cells deficient in Bax and Bak , which can not die through the intrinsic pathway , 8 would undergo a rapid necrotic death when deprived of glucose , as glucose deprivation kills most cells in 24�48 h . Alternatively , it was possible that these cells could remain atrophic but alive for weeks , as it was described that Bax - , Bak-deficient hematopoietic cells , when deprived of growth factors , downregulate glucose transporter 1 but do not die for several weeks.18 We tested whether glucose deprivation provoked cytostatic or cytotoxic effects in SV40-transformed , Bax , Bak DKO MEFs.8 As assessed by morphology and propidium iodide PI incorporation , about 10 % of cells appeared dead by 24 h , with approximately 75 % dead cells within 72 h Figure 1a and b . Their WT counterparts died more rapidly , and were all dead by 48 h Figure 1b , suggesting that these cells die through the mitochondrial pathway . Bax , Bak DKO MEFs can die by a non-apoptotic form of cell death in response to staurosporine , etoposide , 9,19 alkylating DNA agents20 and ER stressors.10 We determined whether the form of cell death induced by glucose deprivation was apoptosis or necrosis . The morphology of dead DKO cells was different from the classical necrotic death induced by thapsigargin in these cells , 10 and was more similar to the morphology of cells dying by apoptosis induced by the combination of TNF and cycloheximide CHX Figure 1a cells rounded up and detached from the culture plate , and they showed a reduction of volume shrinkage . Moreover , when we incubated glucose-deprived cells in the presence of the pan-caspase inhibitor Q-VD-OPH Q-VD , we observed a reduction in the number of dead cells as measured by morphology and PI incorporation , thus indicating that death is caspase-dependent Figure 1a and b . In addition , we observed that cells displayed sub-G1 DNA fragmentation , a marker of apoptosis , with similar kinetics to that of plasma membrane disruption PI uptake Figure 1b . Z-VAD-FMK Z-VAD , an alternative pan-caspase inhibitor , inhibited both subG1 DNA fragmentation and PI incorporation . Other markers of apoptosis such as caspase-3 and PARP cleavage were observed in Bax - , Bak-deficient cells , albeit with slower kinetics than in WT cells Figure 1c . We stained cells with annexin V , which detects phosphatidyl-serine exposure on the surface of apoptotic cells . Glucose-deprived cells displayed annexin V binding before they became PI-positive , another indication of apoptosis Figure 1d . Moreover , phosphatidyl-serine exposure was inhibited by Q-VD . We observed chromatin condensation after glucose depri-vation Figure 1e and f . Nuclei had a different appearance to the classical apoptotic morphology observed after treatment with TNF , or to the relaxed appearance of necrotic cells treated with thapsigargin . After glucose deprivation , DNA was condensed around the periphery of the nuclei . However , this condensation may not be directly related to caspase activa-tion as it occurred in glucose-deprived cells treated with Q-VD . Thus , apoptosis induced by glucose deprivation in Bax - , Bak-deficient cells displayed all of the hallmarks of apoptosis analyzed , with the exception of the characteristic chromatin condensation . Glucose deprivation-induced death is caspase-dependent and does not proceed through the mitochondrial pathway . We had observed that Q-VD and Z-VAD inhibited features of cell death induced by glucose deprivation . To confirm that caspases were active in glucose-deprived DKO cells , we analyzed the cleavage of a synthetic DEVD peptide in cell extracts . Glucose deprivation induced DEVD-ase activity , which was inhibited by Q-VD Figure 2a . In addition , we analyzed cleavage of the effector caspase-3 , which is a marker of its activation . We observed cleavage of caspase-3 in DKO cells after glucose withdrawal that was inhibited by ZVAD Figure 2b . Moreover , we verified that caspases were active by analyzing the cleavage of substrates of effector caspases co-chaperone p23 and PARP . These proteins were cleaved in a Z-VAD-inhibitable manner Figure 2b . To exclude a possible effect of Z-VAD-fmk or Q-VD-OPH on proteases other than caspases , we studied the inhibition of death by other peptidic inhibitors . We observed that a panel of caspase inhibitors prevented both subG1 DNA fragmentation Figure 2c and PI incorporation Figure 2d . These inhibitors were more efficient in inhibiting DNA cleavage than PI uptake , suggesting that the intracellular concentrations of these compounds can inhibit some apoptotic features better than others , or that inhibition of caspases switches the form of death to necrosis in a small percent of the cells . Consistent with data reported in Jurkat cells , 21 VDVAD-fmk and LEHD-fmk were less efficient than IETD-fmk , Z-VAD-fmk and Q-VD-OPH in preventing death . Bax and Bak are required for mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization MOMP during apoptosis , and cells lacking these proteins can not release cytochrome c or undergo apoptosis in response to many stimuli , including microinjection of tBid.8 However , it was possible that glucose deprivation activates the mitochondrial pathway through an unidentified , alternative mechanism . Therefore , we treated cells with shRNA for caspase-9 Figure 3a . This treatment did not affect any of the parameters of cell death tested Figure 3b . Furthermore , we generated DKO cells stably overexpressing Bcl-xL . Bcl-xL inhibits MOMP during apoptosis.22 Bulk-transduced cells pool and four clones were analyzed . As shown in Figure 3c , Bax , Bak DKO MEFs overexpressing Bcl-xL Figure 3d were not protected from death when compared with the parental line . Intriguingly , although caspase inhibitors effectively blocked glucose deprivation-induced cell death in Bax , Bak DKO MEF , we did not observe this effect in WT MEF transduced with Bcl-xL data not shown . It is possible that Bcl-xL promotes necrosis in MEF in response to glucose deprivation , similar to what has been observed in response to etoposide.9 Alternatively , it is possible that the adaptation to the Bax , Bak double-deficient condition primes cells for a novel caspase activation mechanism . We therefore sought to identify the caspase involved in initiating cell death in this setting . Caspase-8 is engaged in death induced by glucose deprivation in Bax , Bak DKO MEFs and HeLa cells . In the absence of a mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis , a likely candidate for initiating the caspase cascade is caspase-8 , required for death receptor-induced23 and other forms of apoptosis.11,24,25 We therefore asked whether caspase-8 was the apical caspase in glucose starvation-induced apoptosis in these cells . We generated a stable cell line expressing short hairpin RNA shRNA targeting caspase-8 , and selected individual clones expressing low levels of caspase-8 Figure 4a . As expected , these clones and the parental pool displayed decreased sensitivity to TNF when compared with cells transfected with the empty vector Figure 4b . When incubated in the absence of glucose , we observed that these clones and the parental pool were less sensitive than their mock-transfected counterparts to glucose deprivation Figure 4c . To exclude the possibility of an off-target effect of this construct , or a compensation effect of the stable downregulation of caspase-8 , we transiently transfected two different siRNA oligonucleotides against caspase-8 . We were able to achieve a moderate reduction in caspase-8 levels Figure 4d . This reduction conferred a mild but reproducible protection from death ligands data not shown and glucose deprivation Figure 4e . Knockdown of caspase-8 reduced glucose deprivation-induced cleavage of caspase-3 Figure 4f . We had observed that the peptidic caspase inhibitor IETD-fmk inhibited glucose deprivation-induced death Figure 2c and d , suggesting that the enzymatic activity of caspase-8 is required for death . However , although IETD-fmk is widely used to block caspase-8 activity , it can also inhibit effector caspases.21 In order to test whether the enzymatic activity of mature caspase-8 is required for apoptosis in this system , we transfected DKO cells with the viral caspase inhibitor CrmA , which preferentially inhibits caspase-8 , although it can also inhibit the inflammatory caspase-1.2,26 Cells transfected with CrmA were protected from death receptor-induced apoptosis Figure 4g . CrmA effectively inhibited death induced by glucose deprivation in Bax , Bak DKO MEF Figure 4h . To test whether caspase-8 dependency was exclusive of Bax , Bak DKO MEF , we used siRNA to knockdown caspase-8 in established tumor lines . Although we observed no effect on glucose deprivation-induced death in the MCF7 breast cancer line not shown , we observed an effect in HeLa cells . Knockdown of caspase-8 in HeLa cells reduced caspase-8 levels Figure 5a , and prevented death induced by TNF Figure 5b . Strikingly , this decrease in caspase-8 reduced glucose deprivation-induced cell death to the same extent than with incubation with Q-VD Figure 5b . The extrinsic pathway is not involved in glucose starvation-induced apoptosis in Bax , Bak DKO cells . Caspase-8 is activated in response to death receptor ligation . It has been shown that some drugs can induce caspase-8-mediated apoptosis through the induction of death ligands such as FasL , TNF or TRAIL.27�29 Thus , one possibility is that glucose deprivation is activating the extrinsic pathway by inducing the synthesis and or secretion of death ligands , which might kill the cells in an autocrine manner . To explore this possibility , we analyzed by RT-PCR the mRNA levels of death ligands and used blocking antibodies against death ligands and receptors . We could not detect the expression of Fas ligand mRNA in these cells not shown . Furthermore , we starved cells from glucose in the presence of neutralizing antibodies for Fas-ligand or Fas-Fc Figure 6a , which did not prevent death . TRAIL expression did not change after glucose withdrawal Supplementary Figure S1A . Moreover , we could not detect toxicity of TRAIL in these cells , even in the presence of CHX or upon glucose deprivation , which has been shown to sensitize human tumor cells to TRAIL30 Supplementary Figure S1B . In addition , we incubated cells in the presence of anti-TRAIL or TRAIL-R-FC Supplementary Figure S1C and D , which did not have any effect on cell death induced by glucose deprivation . A slight increase in TNF mRNA levels was detected Figure 6b . Although TNF did not kill these cells unless they were co-incubated with CHX Figure 6c , the possibility remained that glucose deprivation sensitizes cells to TNF.30 To explore this possibility , we preincubated cells without glucose and then added TNF . We observed that glucose deprivation did not sensitize these cells to TNF , as the combination of glucose deprivation and TNF caused the same amount of death than glucose deprivation alone . The combination of glucose deprivation plus CHX and TNF caused additive effects on cell death numbers Figure 6c . In addition , we incubated glucose-deprived cells in the presence of neutralizing antibodies against TNF and TNF-R1 , which did not prevent death Figure 6d . In another approach to examining the possible role of the death receptor pathway in glucose deprivation-induced apoptosis in Bax , Bak DKO cells , we examined the effects of c-FLIP . Overexpression of c-FLIP inhibits caspase-8 activation at the DISC.31 We generated Bax , Bak DKO MEF that stably overexpress c-FLIPL , and as expected , these cells were protected from TNF or anti-Fas-induced apoptosis Figure 7a . However , they were not protected from glucose deprivation-induced apoptosis , suggesting that caspase-8 is activated independently of a conventional death receptor-induced DISC Figure 7b . Recently , a novel form of caspase-8-and FADD-mediated apoptosis has been described.32 When TNF is combined with Smac mimetics , TNF induces the formation of a caspase-8 activation complex formed by RIPK1 , FADD and caspase-8 , which leads to apoptosis . Cell death mediated by this complex is poorly inhibited by FLIP . In order to test a role for RIPK1 in our system , we incubated DKO cells in the presence of Necrostatin-1 Nec-1 . Nec-1 is an allosteric inhibitor of RIPK1 kinase activity , and it inhibits RIPK1-mediated necroptosis death receptor-mediated necrosis . As RIPK1 kinase activity is required for apoptosis induced by combination of TNF and Smac mimetics , we deprived cells of glucose in the presence of Nec-1 . Incubation with Nec-1 did not prevent glucose deprivation-induced cell death Figure 7c . To exclude a function of RIPK1 , which could not be inhibited by Nec-1 , we used siRNA to knockdown RIPK1 Figure 7d . The resultant decrease in RIPK1 was sufficient to inhibit death induced by TNF in the presence of the Smac mimetic Compound A Figure 7f , but did not influence glucose deprivation-induced cell death Figure 7e and f . Thus , neither the classical DISC nor the second , RIPK1-dependent caspase-8 activating complex appear to be involved in glucose deprivation-induced apoptosis . Bax and Bak are essential mediators of apoptosis induced by most stimuli.8 Because the mitochondrial pathway is frequently inactivated in tumor cells , it may be clinically relevant to find means to induce necrosis or mitochondria-independent apoptosis . Glucose deprivation has been shown to induce necrosis in some cancer cell lines . We show here that SV-40-transformed MEFs with an impairment of the mitochondrial pathway can die by apoptosis upon glucose deprivation , and that this form of apoptosis is mediated by caspase-8 . Inhibition of cell metabolism by nutrient deprivation has been extensively studied as a means to preferentially kill tumor cells , because these cells display numerous alterations in metabolic pathways , including abnormal glucose and glutamine uptake.33 Indeed , a non-metabolizable glucose analog , 2-deoxyglucose , is currently in clinical trials as an antitumor agent . Moreover , growth factors upregulate glucose uptake and metabolism to induce prosurvival and antiapopto-tic effects.13 Glucose metabolism interferes with apoptosis at different steps , regulating both the extrinsic and the intrinsic pathways in tumor cells.17,30,34 Therefore , deciphering the death pathways engaged by glucose deprivation will be helpful for rational design of clinical trials with antimetabolites and molecules which inhibit growth factor signaling . Our results suggest that tumors deficient in caspase-8 may be resistant to glucose deprivation or non-metabolizable glucose analogs , opening the possibility that this protease may be a prognostic marker of success of anti-glycolytic treatments . Caspase-8 expression is frequently impaired in tumors , especially those of the brain and childhood tumors.35,36 An intriguing possibility raised by our findings is that perhaps tumor cells with diminished caspase-8 expression are selected for their ability to resist conditions of low blood flow and glucose supply , which are commonly found in the tumor microenvironment . In this work , we show that glucose deprivation induces an atypical form of caspase-8 activation in Bax - , Bak-deficient MEFs . Caspase-8 is usually activated in a DISC complex formed upon ligation of death receptors . It is worth noting that caspase-8-dependent death has been described in response to stimuli other than death receptors , 11,24,25 which suggests that caspase-8 can be activated in �alternative� platforms . It is unlikely that the classical death ligand-induced DISC is formed upon glucose deprivation , as blocking interactions between death receptors and their ligands did not block death . Moreover , FLIP overexpression , which inhibits death receptor-induced apoptosis , did not inhibit apoptosis induced by glucose removal . Caspase-8 has been described to be activated in an FADD-dependent manner with some stimuli , in the absence of death receptor�ligand interactions.37,38 We have not been able to obtain conclusive results regarding the involvement of FADD as the adapter protein for caspase-8 activation after glucose deprivation . We can not exclude that , upon glucose removal , endogenous FADD may be aggregated intracellularly , inter-acting with caspase-8 and promoting its activation . However , as FLIP overexpression did not prevent apoptosis in our system , we studied the possible role of RIPK1 . This protein contains a death domain and forms a complex with FADD and caspase-8 upon treatment with TNF and Smac mimetics.32 Although knockdown of RIPK1 prevented the latter form of cell death , it did not prevent apoptosis in our system , suggesting that a novel caspase-8 activating complex is formed upon glucose deprivation . One stimulus that has been shown to promote activation of caspase-8 in the cytosol is the accumulation of polyglutamine repeats . Expression of ataxin-3 with an expanded polyglutamine tract is toxic to neurons . Sanchez � et al.39 observed that cell death is caspase-8-dependent in this system . Caspase-8 and FADD were shown to be recruited to polyglutamine inclusions , which could serve as an aggregation platform for caspase-8 . As glucose is required for protein glycosylation , and impairment of glycosy-lation leads to accumulation of misfolded proteins , it can be speculated that glucose deprivation could promote the generation of protein inclusions , which could recruit and activate caspase-8 . The results presented here , together with other reports , indicate that glucose deprivation can kill cells in three different ways necrosis , mitochondrial apoptosis or caspase-8-de-pendent apoptosis . Why some cells undergo �uncontrolled� necrotic death while other cells undergo apoptosis is still not clear . In our system , caspase inhibitors did not support clonogenicity of glucose-deprived cells Supplementary Figure 2 , indicating that this stimulus can induce caspase-independent cell death in the same cells . We show here that HeLa cells , which are able to undergo apoptosis through the mitochondrial pathway , die in a caspase-8-dependent manner upon glucose deprivation . This suggests that the caspase-8-dependent pathway of apoptosis described here could be engaged in cells with an intact mitochondrial pathway as well as in Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL-overexpressing tumor cells . This pathway may be relevant for pathologies that involve conditions of low glucose , such as ischemia and cancer . Materials and Methods Cell culture and treatments .

20203691	JJ Kim1 , SB Lee1 , JK Park2 and YD Yoo* , 1 Tumor necrosis factor-a TNF-a is a major mediator of inflammation . There are two main pathways in TNF-a signaling . One is the pro-survival pro-inflammatory pathway that activates NF-kB and MAPK through TNF-a-induced signaling complex I.1 After binding of the trimeric TNF-a to the cell surface receptor TNF�R1 , the silencer of death domain dissociates from TNF�R1 complexes , and the TNF receptor-associated protein with death domain TRADD � an adaptor protein � binds to the cytoplasmic domain of the receptor.2 TRADD recruits additional proteins including TNF receptor-associated factor 2 TRAF2 , receptor-interacting protein 1 RIP1 , and cellular inhibitor of apoptosis proteins to form TNF-a-induced signaling complex I.3,4 The other TNF-a signaling pathway is the proapoptotic pathway through TNF-a-induced signaling complex II , in which reactive oxygen species ROS , a caspase cascade , and the mitochondria function as downstream mediators . If TRADD , TRAF2 , and RIP1 dissociate from the receptor , they recruit Fas-associated death domain protein FADD and pro-caspase-8 to form TNF-a-induced signaling complex II , which is implicated in signaling apoptosis.5,6 This TNF-a-induced cell death pathway is normally blocked by concomitant activation of NF-kB . ROS generation , after TNF-a binding , has been reported to be involved in both cell survival and cell death , and the main source of ROS generation that contributes to TNF-a-induced cell death is the mitochondrion.7�9 However , another study reported that NADPH oxidase is the source of ROS genera - tion after TNF-a treatment.10 ROS are known to contribute to cell death by inducing mitochondrial membrane permeabiliza-tion and sustaining c-Jun N-terminal kinase JNK activation.11,12 JNK is activated by the activation of apoptosis signal-regulating kinase-1 or by ROS-mediated inactivation of MKPs.13,14 There are several reports regarding the mecha-nism of JNK-induced apoptosis in response to TNF-a . JNK induces cFLIP degradation through Itch activation to trigger apoptosis.15�17 JNK also contributes to TNF-a-stimulated cell death by cleavage of Bid into jBid , which stimulates the release of Smac Diablo into the cytosol to activate caspases.18 B-cell lymphoma-extra large Bcl-XL is known to stabilize Dcm to maintain mitochondrial homeostasis.19,20 Bcl-XL-promoted Dcm stabilization seems to prevent cell death because massive cell death was observed in Bcl-XL-deficient mice.21 TNF-a D-GalN-induced cell death from a variety of stimuli was blocked by Bcl-XL overexpression.22,23 Gottlieb et al.24 suggested that TNF-a treatment induces an early decrease in Dcm and subsequent ROS formation , which promotes a late decrease in Dcm , and that Bcl-XL expression inhibits the early decrease in Dcm and the subsequent ROS generation after TNF-a stimulation . ROS modulator 1 Romo1 is localized in the mitochondria and induces mitochondrial ROS production through complex III of the mitochondrial electron transport chain.25�27 The ROS originating from the endogenous Romo1 protein appear to be indispensable for both normal and cancer cell proliferation , because Romo1 knockdown inhibits cell-cycle transition through inhibition of Erk activation and p27Kip1 expres-sion.28,29 Romo1 expression is induced by an external stimulus such as 5-FU , and it is upregulated in senescent cells and in most cancer cells.25,26,30 As the mitochondrial origin of ROS formation triggered by TNF-a is not clear , and Romo1 contributes to ROS production in the mitochondria , we investigated whether TNF-a-induced ROS are associated with Romo1 . Results Romo1 is responsible for TNF-a-induced ROS produc - tion . We examined TNF-a-induced ROS production by staining cells with the oxidant-sensitive dye , 5-and-6 -chloromethyl-20,70-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate acetyl ester CM-H2DCFDA , after Romo1 knockdown by Romo1 small-interfering RNA siRNA transfection . As ROS produced by TNF-a are eliminated by FHC and MnSOD , which are products of TNF-a-activated NF-kB signaling , 31 cells were treated with the translation inhibitor , cycloheximide CHX , to suppress NF-kB signaling stimulated by TNF-a . As expected , TNF-a treatment increased ROS levels in cells pretreated with CHX Figure 1a . Interestingly , the TNF-a-stimulated ROS increase was completely blocked by Romo1 knockdown . The decrease in ROS formation was quantified using MetaMorph software and is illustrated in HeLa cells Figure 1a and human embryo kidney HEK 293 cells Supplementary Figure S1a . Butylated hydroxy anisol BHA , an antioxidant , was also added to cells pretreated with CHX . The ROS level in these cells was downregulated by Romo1 knockdown itself Figure 1 , which is consistent with earlier reports.28,29 This experiment was also carried out again in the cells treated with H2O2 as a positive control . HeLa cells were transfected with 100 nM of control siRNA or Romo1 siRNA for 16 h and treated with H2O2 100 mM for 1 h . As expected , ROS increase was observed in the cells transfected with control siRNA Supplementary Figure S1b . Interestingly , ROS production induced by H2O2 treatment was blocked in the cells transfected with Romo1 siRNA . It has been reported that ROS induces ROS release.32 Therefore , we suggest that H2O2 treatment induces ROS production through Romo1 . The exact mechanism as to how Romo1 may be involved in H2O2-triggered ROS induction is now under investigation . Suppression of a TNF-a-induced ROS increase by Romo1 knockdown was also observed by flow cytometry , and the same result was obtained in HeLa cells Figure 1b and HEK 293 cells Supplementary Figure S1c . As dominant negative-I-kB DN-I-kB overexpression inhibits NF-kB translocation to the nucleus , DN-I-kB was transfected into HeLa cells to inhibit the TNF-a-induced NF-kB activation . Blockage of TNF-a-stimulated nuclear translocation of NF-kB on DN-I-kB expression was observed by immunofluorescence analysis Figure 1c . TNF-a treatment also increased ROS levels in cells transfected with DN-I-kB , and the ROS increase was completely suppressed by Romo1 knockdown in HeLa cells Figure 1d and HEK 293 cells Supplementary Figure S1d . The inhibition of ROS formation was quantified by MetaMorph software and is shown in Figure 1e and Supplementary Figure 1e . Suppression of TNF-a-induced ROS formation by Romo1 knockdown was also observed by flow cytometry Figure 1f . To measure the transfection efficiency of Romo1 siRNA by flow cytometry , Romo1 siRNA-FITC was transfected into these two cell lines the Romo1 siRNA transfection efficiencies were above 90 % data not shown . Romo1 knockdown was examined by western blotting Figure 1g or RT-PCR Supplementary Figure S1f , and the result was consistent with earlier reports.26�29 TNF-a-induced JNK activation and cell death are regulated by Romo1-mediated ROS production . We examined whether Romo1 regulated TNF-a-triggered JNK activation and cell death . As shown in Figure 2a , TNF-a treatment induced prolonged JNK activation in cells pretreated with CHX , and Romo1 knockdown inhibited this JNK activation . Next , we examined whether Romo1 was involved in TNF-a-induced apoptotic cell death . Romo1 siRNA was transfected into HeLa cells , and cell death was observed after TNF-a treatment . Figure 2b and Supplementary Figure S2a show that TNF-a stimulation in the presence of CHX induced cell death , and that cell death was inhibited by Romo1 knockdown or BHA treatment . However , Romo1 siRNA transfection failed to completely inhibit cell death , showing that another signaling pathway independent of Romo1 also exists in TNF-a-stimulated cell death . To observe apoptotic body formation in TNF-a-induced cell death , we stained cells with DAPI and visualized them by fluorescence microscopy after Romo1 knockdown . As shown in Figure 2c and Supplementary Figure S2b , TNF-a treatment increased the formation of apoptotic bodies , whereas Romo1 knockdown decreased their formation . To see the cleavage of mediators involved in TNF-a-induced apoptosis , western blotting was performed after Romo1 knockdown . Figure 2d shows that cleavage of caspase-8 , caspase-3 , PARP , RIP1 , and Bid was observed after TNF-a treatment , and that Romo1 knockdown inhibited these cleavages , showing that Romo1 is an upstream mediator of caspase-8 and Bid in TNF-a-triggered apoptosis . Next , cells were treated with zVAD , a caspase inhibitor , before TNF-a treatment to determine whether zVAD blocked TNF-a-induced cell death . As expected , Romo1 knockdown partially inhibited TNF-a-induced cell death , whereas zVAD treatment more effectively prevented cell death Figure 2e Supplementary Figure S2c . These results show that Romo1 is an important mediator of cell death triggered by TNF-a . TNF-a-induced signaling complex II binds to the C-terminal region of Romo1 in response to TNF-a . To see the interaction between endogenous Romo1 and TNF complex II , RIP1 was immunoprecipitated with anti-RIP1 antibody , and western blotting was performed with an anti-Romo1 antibody . Figure 3a shows that RIP1 interacted with endogenous Romo1 at 15 min and continued to 4 h during TNF-a stimulation . To confirm this interaction , Flag-tagged Romo1 was transfected into HEK 293 cells , and the Romo1 protein was immunoprecipitated with Flag antibody to perform western blotting with RIP1 , TRADD , TRAF-2 , Romo1 siRNA Control siRNA Romo1 siRNA 4 h 6 h TNF- ? CHX 6 6 TNF- ? h 6 h 6 FADD , and caspase-8 . Figure 3b shows that Romo1 interacted with RIP1 as well as TRADD , TRAF-2 , FADD , and caspase-8 at 15 min and continued to 4 h during TNF-a stimulation . The colocalization of Romo1 and RIP1 in HEK 293 cells was also observed by confocal microscopy . As 56 kDa JNK 75 Survival 43 kDa -c-Jun 50 % 43 kDa 25 shown in Figure 3c , on TNF-a stimulation , the green Flag-Romo1 signals completely overlapped with the red RIP1 signals . The green RIP1 signals also overlapped with the mitochondria-specific MitoTracker red fluorescent dye Figure 3d . In addition , we examined the colocalization of 3 6 9 0 3 6 9 TNF- ? CHX h TNF- ?

N the other TNF-a signaling complex II proteins with Romo1 Supplementary Figure S3 shows that they translocated into the mitochondria to interact with Romo1 . In an earlier report , we suggested that Romo1 is a transmembrane protein with a molecular weight of 72 kDa RIP1 34 kDa 43 kDa ? -actin approximately 8.9 kDa.25 The transmembrane domain was also predicted using SMART http smart.embl-heidelberg.de and CBS Prediction Servers http www.cbs.dtu.dk services TMHMM . Therefore , we made two deletion mutants of Romo1 , designated Romo1-DC and Romo1-DN , and examined which domain interacted with TNF-a-induced signaling complex II Figure 3e . As shown in Figure 3f , the C-terminal region of Romo1 interacted with TNF-a-induced signaling complex II , showing that the C-terminal domain of Romo1 was oriented into the cytosol . Next , we observed whether these deletion mutants localized to the mitochondria and induced mitochondrial ROS generation . Figure 3g and h shows that only the N-terminal deletion mutant localized to the mitochondria and enhanced ROS levels . In contrast , the C-terminal deletion mutant was found in the whole cell and failed to generate mitochondrial ROS . These results show that the mitochondrial localization signal is located in the C-terminal domain and that the C-terminal domain is important for TNF-a-induced ROS production . To test the Romo1 topology , the mitochondria were isolated from HEK 293 cells transfected with N-terminally Flag-tagged Romo1 or C-terminally myc-tagged Romo1 . After digestion with proteinase K in the presence or absence of Triton X-100 , western blotting was performed using anti-Flag or myc antibodies . As shown in Figure 4 , the C-terminally myc-tagged Romo1 was digested by proteinase K . However , the N-terminally Flag-tagged Romo1 protein remained . Instead , the N-terminally Flag-tagged Romo1 was detected at a smaller size . This result shows that the C-terminus of Romo1 is exposed to the cytosol . Voltage-dependent anion channel VDAC , in the outer mitochondrial membrane , and Mn-SOD , in the mito-chondrial matrix , were used as positive controls . TNF-a-induced initial decrease of Dwm through Romo1 is followed by ROS production . TNF-a induces the initial decrease of Dcm , leading to ROS generation and subsequent loss of Dcm , which triggers ROS formation to induce apoptosis.24,33 To examine whether TNF-a-induced loss of Dcm is regulated by Romo1 , HeLa cells were transfected with Romo1 siRNA for 16 h , pretreated with CHX , BHA , stigmatellin , or rotenone , and then incubated with TNF-a for the indicated times Dcm decrease was then determined by staining the cells with 5,50,6,60-tetrachloro-1,10,3,30-tetraethylbenzimidazolcarbocyanine iodide JC-1 . Red fluorescence indicates a high Dcm and green fluorescence conversely indicates a low Dcm . Romo1 knockdown itself stabilized Dcm , showing that Romo1 expression contributed to loss of Dcm Figure 5a and b . After TNF-a treatment , the decrease of Dcm was detected by fluorescence microscopy in cells transfected with control siRNA this decrease of Dcm was inhibited by Romo1 knockdown or BHA treatment Figure 5a and b . Interestingly , although the TNF-a-induced decrease in Dcm was inhibited by Romo1 knockdown at 15 min , the TNF-a-induced decrease of Dcm was not blocked by BHA treatment Figure 5a and b . The earlier report showed that Romo1-mediated ROS production was generated from the mitochondrial electron transport chain.26 Therefore , we examined whether the inhibitors of the mitochondrial electron transport chain blocked the initial decrease of Dcm after TNF-a stimulation . Stigmatellin or rotenone also failed to inhibit the initial TNF-a-induced decrease of Dcm Figure 5a and b . These results indicate that the initial TNF-a-induced decrease of Dcm at 15 min was only blocked by Romo1 knockdown , and that the initial decrease of Dcm mediated by Romo1 after TNF-a stimulation was independent of ROS production . As shown in Figure 5b , the decrease of Dcm � indicated by the downshift of the dotted squares � was accelerated in control cells at 4 h , and BHA or stigmatellin treatment inhibited the late TNF-a-induced decrease of Dcm at 4 h . Figure 5c and d shows the quantified data of Figure 5b by representing the ratio of the signal of high Dcm red to the signal of low Dcm green . As expected , rotenone treatment failed to block the late TNF-a-induced decrease of Dcm , showing that the late TNF-a-induced decrease of Dcm was triggered by ROS originating from complex III in the DAPI aggregate monomer DAPI Control -siRNA BHA Stig . Control siRNA Rot . Control siRNA Romo1 siRNA Control siRNA + BHA monomer DAPI Green 1.25 Green 1.5 Red 1.0 0.5 Ratio Inhibitor mitochondrial electron transport chain . Without CHX treatment , the late TNF-a-induced decrease of Dcm was recovered , because antioxidant enzymes such as FHC and MnSOD induced by NF-kB seemed to eliminate ROS generated from mitochondria Figure 5e . To confirm these results , Dcm decrease was also examined by staining the cells with tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester TMRM . The same result was obtained in the cells stained with TMRM , compared with the cells with JC-1 Figure 5f . The change of Dcm was quantified using MetaMorph software and is illustrated in Figure 5g . On the basis of these results , we suggest that Romo1 mediates the early TNF-a-induced decrease of Dcm to trigger ROS production , which leads to the late decrease of Dcm and subsequent ROS accumulation . DAPI Control siRNA - BHA Control siRNA Stig . Rot . Romo1 regulates TNF-a-induced early decrease of Dwm through interaction with Bcl-XL . First , we examined whether endogenous Romo1 interacted with the Bcl-XL protein through coimmunoprecipitation assays . To examine this interaction , Bcl-XL was immunoprecipitated with its antibody , and western blotting was performed with anti-Romo1 antibody . As shown in Figure 6a , Bcl-XL was associated with Romo1 , but not with TNF-a-induced signaling complex II components . Interestingly , Bax was released from Bcl-XL after TNF-a stimulation , and Romo1 showed weak binding with Bcl-XL without TNF-a stimulation Figure 6a . To confirm this interaction , Flag-tagged Romo1 was transfected into HEK 293 cells , and the Romo1 protein was immunoprecipitated with Flag antibody to perform western blotting with Bcl-XL or Bcl-2 antibodies . On TNF-a Control siRNA + Romo1 siRNA - stimulation , concurrent Romo1 binding to Bcl-XL , compared with the binding of Romo1�TNF-a-induced signaling complex II , was observed the binding was increased for up to 4 h . In contrast , Romo1 did not associate with Bcl-2 , Bax , or VDAC Figure 6b . Using deletion mutants of Romo1 , we explored which region of Romo1 was required for binding to Bcl-XL . As shown in Figure 6c , the C-terminal region of Romo1 was necessary for binding to Bcl-XL . In this study , we showed an early TNF-a-induced decrease of Dcm through Romo1 and the interaction of Romo1 with Bcl-XL . Therefore , we examined whether the early TNF-a-induced decrease of Dcm mediated by Romo1 was regulated by Bcl-XL . As shown in Figure 7a , the downshift of dots was increased in cells transfected with Romo1 and inhibited by Bcl-XL expression . Figure 7b shows the quantified data of Figure 7a by representing the ratio of the signal of high Dcm red to the signal of low Dcm green . Next , we examined whether Bcl-XL prevented the early TNF-a-induced decrease of Dcm at 15 min . As shown in Figure 7c�e , the early TNF-a-induced decrease of Dcm was blocked by Bcl-XL expression . From these results , we suggest that Romo1 mediated the early TNF-a-induced decrease of Dcm by binding to Bcl-XL and preventing its function . Bcl-XL prevents TNF-a-induced cell death mediated by Romo1 . TNF-a-induced cell death is known to be suppressed by Bcl-XL expression.24 We also investigated whether Bcl-XL prevented TNF-a-induced ROS production this production was measured by flow cytometry after Bcl-XL transfection . As shown in Figure 8a and b , Bcl-XL 3 Green 2 Red Ratio 1 Vector Bcl-XL % 30 cell 25 m 20 ? ? 15 High 10 cell 20 m 15 ? ? overexpression blocked TNF-a-induced ROS formation . Next , we investigated whether Bcl-XL prevented Romo1-induced cell death . After Bcl-XL and Romo1 were transfected into HeLa cells , the number of cells was counted . As shown in Figure 8c , Bcl-XL prevented Romo1-induced cell death . To address whether TNF-a-induced cell death mediated by Romo1 was regulated by Bcl-XL , HeLa cells were transfected with Romo1 , Bcl-XL , or Romo1 and Bcl-XL . As shown in Figure 8d , Bcl-XL effectively inhibited not only TNF-a-induced cell death , but also TNF-a-induced cell death enhanced by Romo1 expression . In Figure 6c , we showed that the C-terminal region of Romo1 was important for binding to Bcl-XL . Therefore , HeLa cells were transfected with the C-terminal region of Romo1 or the N-terminal region of Romo1 . The C-terminal region of Romo1 , as well as the full-length version , did induce cell death Figure 8e Supplementary Figure S4 . Unexpectedly , the N-terminal region of Romo1 also induced cell death . We do not know why the N-terminal region of Romo1 also induced cell death , and this requires further investigation . However , Bcl-XL expression effectively recovered the cell death enhanced by the C-terminal region of Romo1 , but not the cell death enhanced by the N-terminal region of Romo1 . Discussion ROS have an important function in cell survival and cell death triggered by TNF-a signaling , and the main source in ROS generation required for TNF-a-induced cell death is the mitochondria.8,34�36 Therefore , we were curious whether Romo1 was involved in TNF-a-induced ROS production , because Romo1 is located in the mitochondrial membrane and induces ROS generation.25 As shown in Figure 1 , TNF-a-triggered ROS production was completely blocked by Romo1 knockdown , and the same result was obtained with BHA treatment . This result shows that Romo1 is responsible for TNF-a-induced ROS production , and that Romo1 should be located in the outer membrane of the mitochondria to sense the signal elicited by TNF-a . In our earlier report , we showed that the molecular weight of Romo1 is approximately 8.9 kDa , and that Romo1 is a transmembrane protein with a single transmembrane domain.25 In this study , we showed that Romo1 is associated with TNF complex II , which consists of RIP1 , TRADD , TRAF2 , FADD , and pro-caspase-8 , in response to TNF-a stimulation , and that the C-terminus of Romo1 interacts with TNF-a-induced signaling complex II Figure 3 . From the results obtained in this study , we suggest that TNF-a-induced signaling complex II interacts with the C-terminus of Romo1 , which is oriented into the cytosol , and transmits the TNF-a signal to mitochondria . It is unlikely that Romo1 generates ROS in response to TNF-a signaling similar to NADPH oxidase and other enzymes such as xanthine oxidase , cyclooxygenases , and lipoxygenases . Romo1 con-sists of 79 amino acids and has no homology domain when compared with these enzymes . It seems that Romo1 , which is located in the mitochondrial outer membrane , functions as a modulator to supply ROS from complex III of the mitochondrial respiratory chain into the cytosol when the TNF-a signal is delivered to mitochondria through TNF-a-induced signaling complex II . How does Romo1 modulate ROS release from mito-chondria ? Our suggestion is that Romo1 transmits the TNF-a-triggered signal to mitochondria by forming a complex with Bcl-XL to decrease Dcm , resulting in ROS production . Bcl-XL has been reported to stabilize mitochondrial membrane potential Dcm to maintain mitochondrial homeostasis.19,20 An early event in Romo1-mediated ROS production is the concurrent binding of the C-terminus of Romo1 to Bcl-XL , compared with Romo1 binding to TNF-a-induced signaling complex II Figure 6 . Interestingly , Bcl-XL binding to TNF-a-induced signaling complex II is not observed in response to TNF-a . This result indicates that TNF-a-induced signaling complex II-Romo1 binding and Romo1�Bcl-XL interaction occurred simultaneously , and that TNF-a-induced signaling complex II-Romo1 binding led to Romo1�Bcl-XL interaction . We do not know the exact mechanism by which TNF-a-induced signaling complex II-Romo1 induces Romo1�Bcl-XL interaction , and this remains to be clarified through further study . The second event is the loss of Dcm resulting from Romo1�Bcl-XL interaction , which triggers ROS formation . In this study , the TNF-a-induced decrease of early Dcm was inhibited by Romo1 knockdown however , it was not blocked by BHA or mitochondrial complex inhibitors Figure 5 , showing that the initial TNF-a-induced decrease of Dcm is an early event before ROS induction . Our results also showed that Bcl-XL overexpression suppressed these events , which were triggered by TNF-a stimulation Figure 7 . Thus , Romo1 interacts with Bcl-XL to decrease Dcm , leading to subsequent ROS generation after TNF-a stimulation . Interestingly , a basal level of interaction between Romo1 and Bcl-XL was observed without TNF-a treatment Figure 6 . Romo1 overexpression without TNF-a treatment , therefore , induces the loss of Dcm and enhances ROS levels . We showed that Romo1 over-expression caused the loss of Dcm in this study Figure 7b , whereas ROS levels increased by Romo1 overexpression in an earlier report.25 These findings show that the basal interaction between Romo1 and Bcl-xL is important for ROS supply into the cytosol even without stimuli . Consistent with this suggestion , we showed that Romo1 knockdown decreased ROS levels in both normal and tumor cells.28,29 Taken together , Romo1 is an important modulator to supply ROS into the cytosol . Without any signal , Romo1 supplies the minimal level of ROS required for cell survival and proliferation through the basal binding of Romo1 to Bcl-XL . If the cell needs enhanced ROS levels in response to a signal such as TNF-a , Romo1 recruits more Bcl-XL to increase ROS levels . The proposed TNF-a-induced ROS signaling pathway mediated by Romo1 is shown in Figure 9 . Cell life or death , after TNF-a stimulation , is well controlled by the crosstalk between the pro-survival pathway and the proapoptotic pathway . Upregulated production of TNF-a or inappropriate activation of TNF-a signaling has been reported to contribute to a variety of diseases.3 TNF-a-induced cell death can be initiated by the mitochondria-dependent path-way intrinsic pathway or by the mitochondria-independent pathway extrinsic pathway .37 In this study , we showed that Romo1 mediated TNF-a-induced ROS generation by forming a complex with TNF-a-induced signaling complex II and with Bcl-XL . However , Romo1 knockdown with Romo1 siRNA could not completely inhibit TNF-a-induced apoptotic cell Bcl-XL Survival Romo1 fluorescence DCFDA Vector Romo1 Bcl-XL Romo1 + Bcl-XL number time of Relative Ratio death Figure 2 . In the extrinsic pathway , death receptor recruits pro-caspase-8 in TNF-a-induced signaling complex II and activates the caspase cascade to induce apoptotic cell death . Therefore , we assume that TNF-a-induced cell death in the presence of CHX can occur through both pathways , and that Romo1 knockdown inhibits only the mitochondria-dependent cell death pathway .

20224598	www.nature.com cdd Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K hnRNP K belongs to the hnRNP family of proteins . The members of this family interact directly with DNA and RNA through their K-homology domains and regulate gene expression at multi-ple levels , including transcription , RNA splicing , RNA stability and translation.1�2 The expression of hnRNP K has been shown to be aberrantly increased in numerous cancers , 3�6 and we recently reported that high-level hnRNP K expression is correlated with poorer overall survival OS and decreased metastasis-free survival among nasopharyngeal carcinoma NPC patients.5 Our findings were consistent with those from clinical correlation studies in oral squamous cell carcinoma4 and prostate cancer.3 HnRNP K is a nucleocytoplasmic shuttling protein that is primarily located in the nucleus for transcriptional regulation.1 However , cytoplasmic accumulation of hnRNP K through ERK-mediated phosphorylation of hnRNP K serines-284 and -353 has been reported in cervical carcinoma HeLa , 7 chronic myelogenous leukemia8 and NPC9 cells . The tumorigenic activity of hnRNP K appears to be conferred through its ability to increase proliferation , 10 antiapoptotic effects , 9 clonogenic potential8 and metastasis.11 These functions may be due , at least in part , to the ability of hnRNP K to upregulate the c-myc , 8,12 thymidine phosphorylase TP 9 and eIF4E10 genes through transcriptional or post-transcriptional regulation . However , the full spectrum of targets regulated by hnRNP K has not as yet been systematically examined . The acquisition of resistance to apoptosis is considered a hallmark of cancer , and impairment of apoptotic pathways is one of the underlying mechanisms of chemoresistance in cancer cells . The TRAIL ligand is known to be involved in apoptotic activity TRAIL interacts with the DR4 and DR5 death receptors , thereby regulating the extrinsic apoptotic pathway through sequential recruitment of the Fas-associated death domain and inactive procaspase 8 FLICE to form the death-inducing signaling complex DISC .13 At the DISC , activation of procaspase 8 triggers the activation of effector caspases 3 and -7 , resulting in apoptosis . TRAIL has been shown to induce apoptosis in a broad range of tumor cells and in numerous preclinical trials , without evidence of systemic toxicity.13 TRAIL triggers apoptosis in cancer cells regardless of the p53 status , making it a particularly attractive agent for cancer cells that have become resistant to chemo-or radiotherapy through inactivation of p53.13 The combined use of TRAIL plus traditional chemotherapeutic agents or radiotherapy has been shown to enhance cancer-killing effica-cies and restore the TRAIL sensitivity in previously TRAIL-resistant cells . Phase I and II clinical trials with rhTRAIL and agonist antibodies are ongoing.13 One important inhibitor of TRAIL-induced apoptosis is the FLICE-inhibitory protein FLIP CFLAR , which is predominantly expressed as long FLIPL and short FLIPS splice forms , and functions to inhibit caspase 8.14 Both isoforms of FLIP are recruited to the DISC , where they prevent the full activation of caspase 8 and inhibit apoptosis.14 FLIP has been found to be overexpressed in various cancers , 15�16 and FLIP overexpression has been shown to determine tumoral resistance to treatments with death ligands such as FasL and TRAIL.14 Conversely , down-regulation of FLIP sensitizes previously resistant tumor cells to these ligands.14 NPC is relatively rare in Caucasians , but the disease is relatively common in the Southeastern region of China and in Taiwan . NPC is sensitive to radiation therapy , and more advanced cases may be treated with a combination of radio-and chemotherapy . Although the survival rate of NPC is B92 % at 1 year and B50 % at 5 years , 20�25 % of patients display distant metastases after treatment.17 Thus , it is essential that we develop more sensitive and effective thera-peutic strategies against NPC . In this study , we identified FLIP as a target gene of hnRNP K in NPC cells , and found that FLIP expression is regulated by the hnRNP K nucleolin complex through direct interaction with a poly C sequence in the FLIP promoter . Finally , we found that FLIP over-expression was significantly correlated with hnRNP K over-expression and poor OS in NPC patients . Results Affymetrix analysis of hnRNP K targets . HnRNP K-mediated upregulation of TP can prevent hypoxia-induced apoptosis9 and has been associated with poor prognosis in NPC patients , 5 suggesting that hnRNP K may function as an upstream regulator protein of cancer . To identify additional genes positively regulated by hnRNP K , we performed systematic microarray expression profiling using the Affymetrix HG U133 plus 2.0 chip Affymetrix , Santa Clara , CA , USA on samples representing NPC tumor tissues , adjacent normal tissues , control NPC-TW02 cells and hnRNP K-knockdown NPC-TWO2 cells . As shown in Figure 1a , 1945 genes were reduced in NPC-TW02 cells transiently transfected with hnRNP K siRNA versus those transfected with the negative control siRNA cutoff value , 1.5-fold , whereas 5466 genes were elevated 1.5-fold or more in NPC tissues versus adjacent normal tissues . Comparison of these data sets revealed that 363 genes were elevated in NPC tissues and downregulated in hnRNP K-knockdown cells these were considered potential targets for hnRNP K Figure 1a . Ontological analysis of these 363 genes revealed that 20 and 26 of the genes reportedly contribute to cancer development-related antiapoptosis and migration , respectively Supplementary Tables S1 and S2 . Consis-tent with our previous findings , 5,9 TP was overexpressed in NPC tissues and downregulated by hnRNP K knockdown in NPC cells Figure 1a . To validate our results , we used quantitative RT-PCR to examine the mRNA expression levels of the apoptosis-related genes FLIP , 14 DcR3,18 Rad9B19 and IL7R , 20 and the migration-associated genes RANTES , 21 MMP13,22 ITGB623 and Rap2A24 Figure 1b . The mRNA levels of FLIP , MMP13 , ITGB6 , Rad9B and Rap2A were significantly reduced to 0.2 - , 0.4 - , 0.4 - , 0.3-and 0.8-fold , respectively in hnRNP K-knockdown cells compared with control siRNA-transfected NPC-TW02 cells . As FLIP gene expression appeared to be reduced the most , we further investigated the regulation and antiapoptotic role of hnRNP K-mediated FLIP . HnRNP K-mediated FLIP expression contributes to resistance against TRAIL-induced apoptosis in NPC cells . FLIP is an important inhibitor of TRAIL-induced apoptosis , and FLIP overexpression has been correlated with poor prognosis in colorectal cancer15 and bladder urothelial carcinoma.16 TRAIL is a ligand of the DR4 and DR5 death receptors , and these interactions can induce apoptosis in cancer cells.13 However , the role of hnRNP K in TRAIL-induced apoptosis has not as yet been established . To gain insight into the potential role of hnRNP K in TRAIL-induced apoptosis , we tested FLIP expression in hnRNP K-knockdown and control cells in the presence and absence of TRAIL in three NPC cell lines , NPC-TW01 , -TW02 and -TW04 . As shown in Figure 2a , the level of FLIP protein was reduced significantly in hnRNP K siRNA-treated NPC cells compared with cells treated with control siRNA regardless of TRAIL treatment . As typical apoptotic morpho-logies and cellular shrinkage were observed in TRAIL-treated hnRNP K-knockdown NPC-TW02 cells Figure 2b , left panel , we further measured the effect of hnRNP K knock-down on TRAIL-induced apoptosis using Annexin V staining . As shown in Figure 2b the bottom part of the left panel , TRAIL dose-dependently induced apoptosis in both hnRNP K-knockdown and control NPC-TW02 cells , but TRAIL-induced apoptosis was higher in hnRNP K-knockdown cells versus controls 34.2 versus 15.2 % in 100 ng ml-treated cells Po0.05 . Similar results were found in both NPC-TW01 and -TW04 cells Figure 2b , right panel . We next examined whether FLIP is involved in the enhance-ment of TRAIL-induced apoptosis in hnRNP K-knockdown cells . As shown in Figure 2c , TRAIL treatment significantly increased the proportion of apoptotic cells from 17.9 % in control cells to 34.1 % in hnRNP K-knockdown cells . However , the apoptotic effect of TRAIL was obviously abolished in cells transfected with a FLAG-tagged FLIP expression vector , with the percentage of apoptotic cells decreasing from 34.1 to 21.6 % . As TRAIL has been shown to mediate apoptosis by binding to DR4 and DR5 , we examined the expression of these death receptors in hnRNP K-knockdown and control NPC-TW02 cells . We found that the knockdown of hnRNP K did not affect the expression of DR4 or DR5 Figure 2d . Taken together , our findings reveal that hnRNP K knockdown decreases the expression of FLIP but not DR4 and DR5 , and enhances the sensitivity of NPC cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis . HnRNP K regulates the FLIP promoter directly through its poly C element . We next sought to determine the mechanism s underlying hnRNP K knockdown-mediated FLIP downregulation . Analysis of the FLIP promoter sequence revealed four potential hnRNP K-binding poly C or C-C-C-C elements , R1 to R4 Figure 3a .1 To distinguish between transcriptional activation and post-transcriptional regulation , we examined the effect of hnRNP K knockdown on FLIP promoter activity and mRNA stability . We transfected a FLIP promoter reporter construct 1179 to ? 281 into hnRNP K-knockdown NPC-TW02 cells and examined reporter activity 24 h later . HnRNP K knockdown significantly inhibited FLIP promoter activity by 54.3 % compared with that in control cells Po0.001 Figure 3b . In contrast , the half-life of the FLIP mRNA was similar in control 8.4�1.8 h and hnRNP K-knockdown 7.8�1.5 h cells , as determined by the actinomycin D blockade of de novo RNA synthesis followed by the quantitative RT-PCR of FLIP mRNA levels at 1 , 2 , 4 and 8 h post-treatment Figure 3c . These results suggest that the hnRNP K-mediated changes in FLIP gene expression are due to promoter inhibition , not mRNA destabilization . To verify the ability of hnRNP K to bind to the predicted poly C elements , we performed DNA pull-down assays with R1 , -2 , -3 and -4 DNA-specific probes Figure 3a . Our results showed that hnRNP K specifically bound to probe R4 , but not to the other three probes Figure 3d . Mutation of the poly C element in R4 R4mut abolished this binding , indicating that the interaction between hnRNP K and R4 is specific Figure 3d . To further support our contention that hnRNP K can interact with the endogenous FLIP promoter , we per-formed a chromatin-immunoprecipitation analysis . As shown in Figure 3e , hnRNP K specifically immunoprecipitated with the R4 region of the FLIP promoter , but not with R1 , R2 or R3 . To better delineate the function of the poly C element 26 to 22 in R4 for FLIP promoter activity , we generated FLIP mini-promoter-reporter constructs 37 to ? 281 with and without a mutation in the poly C element 37R4mut , and transfected these constructs into hnRNP K-knockdown and control NPC-TW02 cells . As shown in Figure 3f , the wild-type promoter activity was significantly reduced by 64.5 % in hnRNP K-knockdown versus control cells . In contrast , the poly C mutant promoter showed substantially reduced basal activity to 48.6 % compared with the wild-type promoter , but was resistant to hnRNP K knockdown . Taken together , these results indicate that the poly C element 26 to 22 is critical for hnRNP K-mediated FLIP promoter activity . Identification of FLIP promoter poly C element-binding proteins . To identify other proteins involved in FLIP promoter regulation , proteins capable of binding to the mutant and wild-type poly C element 26 to 22 were profiled using iTRAQ mass spectrometry LTQ-Orbitrap , Thermo Electron , Bremen , Germany . Compared with the proteins that bound to the wild-type probe , 367 proteins showed 1.3-fold or larger reductions in the amount of Table 1 hnRNP K FLIP promoter-associated proteins identified by iTRAQ analysis Protein name Accession number a The number of peptides used for identification of the proteins . b The transcription www.cbil.upenn.edu cgi-bin tess tess . c The hnRNP K interacting proteins . DNA�protein complexes pulled down by the poly C -mutated R4 probe . The results of proteins that were previously known as hnRNP K-associated proteins or the factors predicted for having binding sites on FLIP promoter are shown in Table 1 . Three of the differentially interacting proteins � nucleolin , 2 hnRNP F25 and YB-126 � were previously reported to associate with hnRNP K. Two others , AP-2a and p300 , were predicted to bind to R4 of the FLIP promoter based on a publicly available website for predicting transcription factor-binding elements http www.cbil.upenn.edu cgi-bin tess tess . YY1 were also predicted to bind to elements within R4 , but did not show differential binding with the wild-type versus mutated probes . To further examine these candidate proteins , we used western blotting to analyze their protein levels in pulled-down DNA�protein complexes , and found that the bindings of AP-2a and nucleolin to probe R4 were markedly reduced to 0.2-and 0.5-fold , respectively , by the poly C mutation Figure 4a . We then tested whether AP-2a and nucleolin formed a protein complex with hnRNP K . As shown in Figure 4b , nucleolin and hnRNP K , but not AP-2a , were present in immunoprecipitates separately generated using hnRNP K-and nucleolin-specific antibodies . When we used an anti-AP-2a antibody , neither nucleolin nor hnRNP K were detected in the immunoprecipi-tates . These results suggest that hnRNP K formed a protein complex with nucleolin , but not with AP-2a . These results collectively suggest that nucleolin and AP-2a may bind to the FLIP promoter in an hnRNP K-dependent and -independent manner , respectively . Nucleolin and AP-2a are responsible for FLIP gene regulation . Next , we investigated whether hnRNP K , nucleolin and AP-2a have direct effects on FLIP promoter activity , hnRNP K - , nucleolin-and AP-2a-knockdown . NPC-TW02 cells were separately transfected with reporter constructs corresponding to the FLIP mini promoter , and reporter activity was examined after 24 h Figure 4c . Our results showed that hnRNP K , nucleolin and AP-2a knock-down dramatically inhibited FLIP promoter activity by 62.1 Po0.01 , 73.8 Po0.01 and 51.1 % Po0.01 , respectively . To further test whether FLIP expression could be physio-logically regulated by these three proteins , FLIP protein and mRNA levels were examined in NPC-TW02 cells transfected with siRNA directed against hnRNP K , nucleolin and AP-2a . As shown in Figure 4d , FLIP mRNA levels were significantly reduced to 0.36 - , 0.61-and 0.78-fold in cells transfected with siRNA against hnRNP K , nucleolin and AP-2a , respectively , compared with cells transfected with the control siRNA . Similarly , FLIP protein levels were significantly reduced to 0.1 - , 0.3-and 0.8-fold in cells transfected with siRNA against hnRNP K , nucleolin and AP-2a , respectively Figure 4d . We further assessed the impact of nucleolin and AP-2a knockdown on TRAIL-induced apoptosis in NPC-TW02 cells . As shown in Figure 4e , nucleolin knockdown significantly enhanced TRAIL-induced apoptosis 28.4 % compared with the cells transfected with control siRNA 15.8 % . On the other hand , AP-2a knockdown had lesser effect 21.2 % compared with hnRNP K or nucleolin knockdown . Our results suggest that hnRNP K , nucleolin and AP-2a may be involved in the transcriptional activation of the FLIP promoter . hnRNP K and nucleolin knockdown significantly downregulate FLIP expression and subsequently enhance TRAIL-induced apoptosis . Elevated FLIP correlates with hnRNP K in NPC tissues . No previous study has examined FLIP expression in NPC tissues . Here , we examined 67 NPC biopsies by immunohistochemical staining with an anti-FLIP antibody . As shown in Figures 5a and b , FLIP was highly expressed in tumor cells , whereas only relatively weak staining was seen in the adjacent normal nasopharyngeal epithelium . Forty of the tumor specimens 60 % Figure 5g showed highly intense FLIP staining and were designated �FLIP high� Figure 5c , whereas the remaining 27 specimens 40 % showed weaker staining intensities Figure 5e and were designated �FLIP low.� Representative specimens are shown at lower magni-fication 200 in Supplementary Figure S1 . To examine the physiological role of hnRNP K in FLIP expression in primary NPC samples , we further analyzed the correlation between the levels of FLIP expression and the levels of hnRNP K expression in NPC tissues . Consecutive tissue slides of the same set of specimens were subjected to immunohistochemistry IHC using an anti-hnRNP K anti-body . As shown in Figure 5 , 30 specimens 45 % showed high levels of hnRNP K Figure 5d , whereas 37 specimens 55 % showed low levels of hnRNP K Figure 5f . Statistical analysis using the Pearson w2-test showed that high-level hnRNP K was positively correlated with high-level FLIP expression Figure 5g P ? 0.002 . These results strongly suggest that FLIP expression is positively regulated by hnRNP K in NPC tumor cells . Association of FLIP with OS . To evaluate the prognostic significance of FLIP under current therapeutic protocols , we subjected the same retrospective cohort of 67 NPC patients to a clinical outcome assessment study . No significant correlations were found between high-level FLIP expres-sion and clinicopathological features , including age , gender , tumor stage , node stage , AJCC stage and chemotherapy Supplementary Table S3 . A Kaplan�Meier survival analysis was then carried out to determine the OS for patients as a function of FLIP expression . As shown in Figure 5h , there was a significant difference in OS between patients with high and low levels of FLIP expression P ? 0.015 . We next conducted a multivariate analysis of FLIP with age , gender , tumor stage , node stage and chemotherapy , and found that high FLIP expression P ? 0.005 was an independent prognostic predictor of poor OS Table 2 . Discussion Overexpression of hnRNP K is found in various cancers and has been correlated with poor prognosis.3�6 In this study , we showed a new function for hnRNP K in FLIP regulation and resistance to TRAIL-induced apoptosis . The poly C sequence at 26 to 22 bp upstream of the FLIP transcription start site is bound by the hnRNP K nucleolin complex , which is responsible for transcriptional activation . Moreover , induction of FLIP by hnRNP K increases the resistance of NPC cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis . Importantly , high-level FLIP expression was found to be correlated with poor prognosis and increased expression of hnRNP K in NPC patients . Our findings collectively show that hnRNP K and nucleolin form a complex on the FLIP promoter , thereby inducing FLIP expression through transcriptional activation . This provides a mechanistic explanation for the correlation between FLIP and hnRNP K in NPC . In addition , FLIP may serve as an inde-pendent prognostic and therapeutic marker for NPC . HnRNP K is overexpressed in various cancers , and this overexpression has been correlated with poor prognosis3�6 Table 2 Cox multivariate regression analysis of the association between FLIP and OS of NPC patients Characteristics Patients n ? 67 Agea 4Median pMedian Gender Tumor stage Node stage Chemotherapy FLIP aMedian age is 46 years . bWith statistic significance . suggesting that hnRNP K contributes to tumor progression and malignancy . Recent work has shown that hnRNP K regulates antiapoptosis and cell migration , two biological functions that are critically related to cancer development.9,11 In this study , we identified 46 genes involved in apoptosis and migration as being overexpressed in NPC and upregulated by hnRNP K. Our differentially expressed gene set included TP9 and ITGB6,27 along with 44 other genes that had not been previously reported as hnRNP K targets . Among these differentially expressed genes , FLIP , 15�16 FGF2,28 TP , 5 SULF229 and MMP1330 are known to be overexpressed in various cancers and have been associated with poor prognosis . Thus , our findings suggest that several genes downstream of hnRNP K are overexpressed in cancer and may promote tumor development . FLIP is an antiapoptotic molecule critical to TRAIL-induced apoptosis.14 Consistent with this antiapoptotic function of FLIP , we found that hnRNP K-mediated FLIP expression is necessary and sufficient to maintain resistance to TRAIL-induced apoptosis . Although FLIP is known to be regulated at the translational and post-translational levels14,31 we herein show that hnRNP K can directly bind to the poly C element of the FLIP promoter , transcriptionally activating FLIP and consequently preventing apoptosis . Although transcription of the FLIP gene is also regulated by NF-kB , 32 c-Myc , 33 nuclear factor of activated T cells , 34 androgen receptor response element35 and c-Fos , 36 we found that hnRNP K is indis-pensable for the transcriptional activation of FLIP . Previous studies have shown that hnRNP K can regulate the expression of TP9 and gastrin2 post-transcriptionally . How-ever , we did not find evidence that hnRNP K affects the stability of FLIP mRNA Figure 3c , although FLIP mRNA could be regulated by IRF8 through mRNA stabilization.37 Instead , similar to the hnRNP K-mediated induction of c-myc , Src and eIF4E gene expression through binding of poly C elements in their gene promoters , 1 we herein show that the poly C element of the FLIP promoter is important for its recognition and activation by both hnRNP K and nucleolin . NF-kB has a major role in the transcriptional activation of multiple antiapoptotic genes during cancer progression . The prototypical NF-kB complex is a p65 p50 heterodimer that is important for NF-kB-mediated antiapoptotic effects.38 In the absence of appropriate stimuli , NF-kB is sequestered in the cytoplasm by IkBa protein . On stimulation by factors such as TNFa , IkBa protein is degraded by proteasome , leading to NF-kB nuclear translocation and transcriptional activation.39 Although hnRNP K knockdown-enhanced TRAIL-induced apoptosis is correlated with the loss of FLIP expression , we assess the impact of hnRNP K knockdown on NF-kB activation . As shown in Supplementary Figure S2a and S2b , TNFa stimulation induced nuclear translocation of p65 and p50 , as well as downregulation of IkBa , which were not affected by hnRNP K knockdown . In addition , TNFa treatment had no effect on the survival of NPC-TW02 cells regardless of hnRNP K knockdown Supplementary Figure S2c . These results together suggest that hnRNP K knockdown-enhanced TRAIL-induced apoptosis resulted from the loss of FLIP expression , rather than from the alteration of NF-kB activation . Nucleolin is a multifunctional protein involved in ribosome biogenesis , 40 transcriptional regulation40 and mRNA stabi-lity.2 Nucleolin is an abundant protein , but its overexpression has been correlated with poor prognosis in various cancers.40 Currently , a guanine-rich aptamer of nucleolin , AS1411 , is in phase II clinical trials as an anticancer drug for acute myeloid leukemia and renal cell carcinoma.40 Recent work has shown that nucleolin can bind to a guanine-rich DNA sequence upstream of the c-myc promoter nt 142 to 115 and that it can function as a transcriptional repressor in MCF10A cells.41 Other studies have revealed that a cytosine-rich DNA sequence corresponding to the same region of the c-myc promoter can also be bound by hnRNP K , leading to transcriptional activation in HeLa cells.12 Both nucleolin and hnRNP K favor the binding of single-strand DNA over double-strand ds DNA.41�42 We suggest that these previous findings seem to indicate that hnRNP K and nucleolin may recognize the same promoter site , where they appear to function as cofactors for transcriptional regulation . Consistent with this hypothesis , nucleolin and hnRNP K can form a cytoplasmic protein complex that acts to stabilize gastrin mRNA.2 Here , we show for the first time that hnRNP K and nucleolin can function as cofactors for promoter activation . TRAIL-based systems , many of which are currently under-going preclinical trials , are thought to have high therapeutic potential because TRAIL induces apoptosis in a broad range of tumor cells , spares normal cells , and does not appear to be associated with systemic toxicity.13 However , various cancer cells can resist TRAIL-induced apoptosis by overexpressing FLIP . It is hoped that the development of agents capable of inhibiting FLIP expression could sensitize cancer cells resistant to TRAIL , thereby recovering the efficacy of TRAIL-based cancer therapies in resistant tumors.14 This study , which provides insight into the induction of FLIP by hnRNP K and nucleolin , may aid in the development of new agents capable of inhibiting FLIP expression . In particular , we suggest that the nucleolin-targeting aptamer , AS1411 , could prove useful for sensitizing cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis through inhibition of FLIP expression . In conclusion , we show herein that hnRNP K and nucleolin exert an antiapoptotic function by inducing the antiapoptotic protein , FLIP , through binding to the poly C element of the FLIP promoter and inducing transcriptional activation . FLIP is overexpressed in NPC and is associated with poor prognosis . We believe that high-level expression of hnRNP K , nucleolin and FLIP could be prognostic for TRAIL resistance in NPC patients . Finally , we propose that hnRNP K , nucleolin and FLIP should all be considered potential targets for developing new anticancer agents . Materials and Methods Quantitative RT-PCR .

20300110	Tumor necrosis factor TNF -related apoptosis-inducing ligand TRAIL appears to be a promising candidate for cancer therapeutics because of its ability to preferentially induce apoptosis in malignant cells.1�3 TRAIL induces apoptosis by binding to two death receptors Rs , TRAIL-R1 and -R2 . This leads to the recruitment of the adaptor protein , Fas-associated death domain FADD , which in turn recruits the initiator caspase , caspase-8 , resulting in the formation of the death-inducing signaling complex DISC .1�3 Upon recruitment to the DISC , caspase-8 is activated by auto-proteolytic cleavage , leading to the activation of downstream effector caspases , such as caspase-3 , either directly or indirectly by recruitment of the mitochondrial apoptotic path-way through cleavage activation of the BH3-only protein , Bid , of the Bcl-2 family , eventually causing apoptotic cell death.1�3 We and others have identified a number of distinct mecha-nisms that contribute to the resistance of melanoma cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis.4,5 Among them , the FLICE-like inhibitory protein FLIP can interrupt apoptotic signaling at the DISC level by competing with caspase-8 for binding to FADD.5 FLIP is frequently expressed as two isoforms at the protein level , FLIP long FLIPL and FLIP short FLIPS , which are generated by alternative splicing.5 Both FLIPL and FLIPS contain two N-terminal death effector domains DED that allow for interaction with FADD.5,6 FLIPL in addition has a C-terminal caspase-like domain and is highly homologous to caspase-8 but has no proteolytic activity.6 Moreover , FLIPL can also exert other molecular mechanisms that inhibit TRAIL-induced apoptosis such as activation of NF-kB and Akt.6 Besides caspases , other proteases such as calpain and cathepsins are known to have roles in apoptotic signal transduction.7�9 Under physiological conditions , cathepsins are localized in lysosomes where they function as hydrolases responsible for intralysosomal protein degradation.10 In response to certain apoptotic stimuli such as TNFa , Fas , and p53 , cathepsins are released into the cytosol where some of them , such as the cysteine cathepsins , cathepsin B and L , contribute to the execution of apoptosis either by direct cleavage of key cellular substrates , or by acting in concert with caspases.7�9 Recently , cathepsin B has been shown to be involved in TRAIL-induced apoptosis in various types cells.11,12 Moreover , it has been reported to have a role in induction of apoptosis of melanoma cells by the antifolate agent pyrimethamine.13 The cytosol contains endogenous cysteine cathepsin inhibi-tors , cystatins , which function as threshold inhibitors to protect cells from detrimental consequences caused by lysosomal release of the cathepsins.10,14 Among them , cystatin B appears to be of particular interest , in that cystatin B-deficient mice exhibit increased apoptosis of cerebellar granule cells that is associated with the increased expression of apoptosis genes.10,14 Muta-tions in cystatin B are responsible for the primary defect in Unverrcht�Lundborg disease EPM1 .15 Intriguingly , cystatin B is frequently expressed at high levels in cancer cells.14,16,17 Although the biological significance of the high levels of expression remains to be elucidated , increased cystatin B either on tumor tissues or in serum has been reported to be a biomarker for disease progression in a number of cancers.16,17 In view of the potential involvement of cysteine cathepsins in TRAIL-induced apoptosis of melanoma cells , we have tested if cystatin B has a role in the protection of melanoma cells against TRAIL-induced apoptosis . We show in this report that cystatin B contributes to the resistance of melanoma cells to apoptosis induced by TRAIL , but this is , unexpectedly , not due to the inhibition of cysteine proteases , cathepsin B and L , in the majority of melanoma cell lines . We demonstrate that cystatin B stabilizes FLIPL by preventing its degradation mediated by the E3 ligase Itch , and thus protecting against TRAIL-induced apoptosis in melanoma cells . Results Inhibition of cystatin B sensitizes melanoma cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis . Our initial studies indicated that cystatin B was commonly expressed at relatively high levels in most melanoma cell lines Figure 1a . To examine if cystatin B has a role in the regulation of sensitivity of melanoma cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis , we inhibited cystatin B expression in Mel-RM and Mel-FH , two melanoma cell lines that had mode-rate to high levels of cystatin B and were relatively resistant to TRAIL-induced apoptosis Figure 1a and Supplementary Figure 1A , with shRNA by lentiviral infections Figure 1b . Although inhibition of cystatin B enhanced TRAIL-induced activation of caspase-3 , cleavage of PARP , and accumulation of sub-G1 DNA contents Figure 1c and d , it did not have any significant effect on the sensitivity of the cells to apoptosis induced by the DNA-damaging agent cisplatin , and the BH3 mimetic obatoclax , both of which induce apoptosis of mela-noma cells independently of the death receptor pathway Supplementary Figure 1B and data not shown .18,19 Sensiti-zation of melanoma cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis by inhibition of cystatin B was confirmed with siRNA knockdown of cystatin B in another two melanoma cell lines Sk-Mel-28 and IgR3 that are relatively resistant to TRAIL-induced apoptosis Figure 1e . Cystatin B-mediated protection against TRAIL-induced apoptosis is not related to its inhibitory effect on cathepsin B in most melanoma cell lines . Cystatin B is known to be an endogenous inhibitor against lysosomal cysteine cathepsins.10,14 Among the latter , cathepsin B can retain endopeptidase activity at neutral pH in the cytosol upon release from the lysosome , and has been reported to have a role in TRAIL-induced apoptosis in various types of cells.10,14 Cathepsin B is synthesized as an inactive pro-enzyme 43 kD that is processed into active 25 kD and or 31 kD species.20 As shown in Figure 2a , cathepsin B in melanoma cell lines was predominantly expressed as the active forms . Of note , ME4405 and Mel-AT , the two mela-noma cell lines that were most sensitive to TRAIL-induced apoptosis , appeared to contain the highest levels of cathepsin B Figure 2a and Supplementary Figure 1A . To assess if cathepsin B contributes to TRAIL-induced apoptosis of melanoma cells , the effect of the cathepsin B specific inhibitor CA074Me , as well as the specific inhibitor for another cysteine cathepsin , cathepsin L , z-FF-fmk , on TRAIL-induced apoptosis was examined . Strikingly , although CA074Me partially inhibited TRAIL-induced apoptosis in Me4405 and Mel-AT , the two most sensitive melanoma cell lines , it did not have any notable effect on the sensitivity to TRAIL-induced apoptosis in the other melanoma cell lines Figure 2b , nor did it inhibit TRAIL-induced apoptosis in Mel-RM and Mel-FH cells with cystatin B knocked down Figure 2c . Consistently , CA074Me partially blocked TRAIL-induced activation of caspase-3 in ME4405 , but not in MM200 cells Figure 2b . Inhibition of cathepsin L did not alter the sensitivity of melanoma cells to apoptosis induced by TRAIL Supplementary Figure 2 . To confirm the cell line-dependent effects of inhibition of cathepsin B on TRAIL-induced apoptosis of melanoma cells , we knocked down cathepsin B with siRNA in ME4405 and MM200 cells Figure 2d . Similar to results with CA074Me , inhibition of cathepsin B by siRNA blocked TRAIL-induced apoptosis in ME4405 , but not in MM200 cells . Taken together , these results suggest that although inhibition of cathepsin B by cystatin B may have a role in protection against TRAIL-induced apoptosis in some sensitive melanoma cell lines , for example ME4405 and Mel-AT , it is unlikely to be responsible for inhibition of TRAIL-induced apoptosis by cystatin B in the majority of melanoma cell lines . Inhibition of cystatin B enhances damage to mitochondria and activation of caspase-8 induced by TRAIL . We focused on investigation of the cathepsin B-independent mechanism s by which cystatin B protects melanoma cells against TRAIL-induced apoptosis . As shown in Figure 3a and b , inhibition of cystatin B in Mel-RM and Mel-FH cells with shRNA resulted in increased reduction in mitochondrial membrane potential DCm , and mito-chondrial release of cytochrome C , as revealed by the elevated cytosolic levels of cytochrome C , induced by TRAIL . Similarly , TRAIL-induced activation of caspase-9 Figure 3c and activation of Bax were enhanced by the inhibition of cystatin B Supplementary Figure 3 . We also analyzed the activation of caspase-8 induced by TRAIL in Mel-RM and Mel-FH deficient in cystatin B. Figure 3c shows that TRAIL induced increases in caspase-8 activation when cystatin B was inhibited . Of note , the p12 form of cleaved products of caspase-8 was hardly detected in Mel-RM presumably because of relatively low concentrations in the cells . The importance of enhanced activation of caspase-8 in sensitization of melanoma cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis by inhibition of cystatin B was confirmed by the inhibitory effect of the caspase-8 specific inhibitor z-IETC-fmk on TRAIL-induced apoptosis in cystatin B-deficient Mel-RM and Mel-FH cells Figure 3d . Consistent with this , deficiency in cystatin B resulted in increases in the amount of caspase-8 co-precipitated with FADD , and concomitant reduction in the amount of FLIPL associated with FADD , induced by TRAIL Figure 3e , indicating that cystatin B may protect melanoma cells from TRAIL-induced apoptosis by inhibition of recruit-ment of caspase-8 to the DISC . Downregulation of FLIPL in melanoma cells when cystatin B is inhibited . FLICE-like inhibitory protein is an important endogenous inhibitor of activation of caspase-8 induced by death receptors.4,5 As shown in Figure 4a , inhi-bition of FLIP by siRNA enhanced TRAIL-induced apoptosis in Mel-RM and Mel-FH cells , whereas overexpression of FLIPL or FLIPS protected Mel-CV and MM200 cells from TRAIL-induced apoptosis Figure 4b , thereby confirming an important role of FLIP in attenuating apoptotic signaling initiated by TRAIL in melanoma cells . We examined whether FLIP is involved in cystatin B-mediated protection against apoptosis induced by TRAIL . As shown in Figure 4c , the FLIPL protein levels were notice-ably lower in melanoma cells deficient in cystatin B expres-sion . This did not appear to be caused by off-target effects of the shRNA , but due to a post-transcriptional mechanism s , because shRNA inhibition of cystatin B did not result in any significant change in the levels of FLIP mRNA expression Supplementary Figure 4 . In contrast to inhibition of cystatin B , overexpression of cystatin B increased FLIPL protein levels as shown in Mel-CV and MM200 cells Figure 4d . This was associated with the inhibition of TRAIL-induced apoptosis Figure 4e . Of note , the levels of FLIPs remained unaltered irrespectively of the levels of cystatin B Figure 4c and d . Collectively , these results indicate that cystatin B may impinge on FLIPL expression in melanoma cells . Cystatin B-mediated protection of melanoma cells against TRAIL-induced apoptosis involves stabilization of FLIPL . Consistent with a rapid turn-over rate of the FLIPL protein , 6 treatment with the proteasome inhibitor MG-132 could readily increase the FLIPL levels Figure 5a . To study whether inhibition of cystatin B can change the stability of FLIPL in melanoma cells , we treated Mel-RM and Mel-FH cells deficient in cystatin B with cycloheximide for varying periods upto 4 h , and monitored the changes in the levels of FLIPL expression in western blot analysis . The rate of reduction in the FLIPL protein after treatment with cycloheximide was accelerated in the cells with cystatin B knocked down by shRNA Figure 5b . In contrast , when cystatin B was overexpressed in Mel-CV and MM200 cells , the half-life time of the FLIPL protein was prolonged Supplementary Figure 5A and B . To confirm that decreased FLIPL contributes to the enhancement of TRAIL-induced apoptosis in melanoma cells deficient in cystatin B , we overexpressed FLIPL in Mel-RM and Mel-FH cells with cystatin B stably knocked down by shRNA . As shown in Figure 5c and d , overexpression of FLIPL blocked TRAIL-induced apoptosis and activation of caspase-8 and -3 in the cystatin B-deficient melanoma cells . Of note , there was accumulation of the catalytically inactive p21 form of cleaved caspase-3 . This was presumably due to decreased mitochondrial release of Smac DIABLO as a result of less Bid activation by reduced activation of caspase-8 , in that Smac DIABLO released from the mitochondria is known to be critical for freeing the p21 form of caspsae-3 from inhibition by XIAP in TRAIL-induced apoptosis of melanoma cells.21 Together , these results indicate that cystatin B stabilizes FLIPL , which in turn protects melanoma cells from TRAIL-induced apoptosis by inhibiting the activation of caspase-8 . Cystatin B prevents FLIPL from degradation by Itch . As proteasomal degradation of FLIPL is mediated by the E3 ubiquitin ligase Itch , 22 we examined whether alterations in cystatin B levels may impinge on the interaction between Itch and FLIPL . Figure 6a shows that Itch could be co-precipitated with FLIPL in melanoma cells , but the amount of Itch in FLIP precipitates from Mel-CV and MM200 cells overexpressing cystatin B was lower than that from the cells transfected with the vector alone Figure 6b . Consistent with this , overexpression of cystatin B reduced the levels of FLIPL ubiquitination Figure 6c . As the levels of FLIPL expression in cystatin B deficient cells were low , we were unable to compare the amount of Itch associated with FLIPL expression in these cells with that in the corresponding control cells . To confirm that the inhibition of interaction between Itch and FLIPL is responsible for cystatin B-mediated stabilization of FLIPL , we transfected a siRNA pool for Itch into Mel-RM and Mel-FH cells with cystatin B stably knocked down by shRNA Figure 6d . These cells expressed reduced levels of FLIPL in comparison with those transduced with the control shRNA provide further significant protection against TRAIL-induced apoptosis in comparison with overexpression of cystatin B alone Figure 6b and f . To determine whether cystatin B blocks the interaction between Itch and FLIPL by direct binding to these proteins , we carried out GST-pull down assays on whole cell lysates from Mel-RM and Mel-FH cells using either GST-cystatin B or GST as bait . The proteins pulled down were subjected to western blot analysis for Itch and FLIP . Analysis for cathepsin B and L that are known to interact with cystatin B was included as a control . Figure 6g shows that although cathepsin B and L were detected , neither Itch nor FLIP could be observed in the proteins pulled down by GST-cystatin B. Consistently , neither Itch nor FLIP could be co-immunoprecipitated with cystatin B from whole cell lysates of Mel-RM and Mel-FH cells data not shown . Discussion The results above appear to provide several new insights into the regulation of TRAIL-induced apoptosis in melanoma cells . They show that cystatin B , an endogenous cysteine cathepsin inhibitor , protects melanoma cells against TRAIL-induced apoptosis regardless of the absence of involvement of the cathepsins in apoptosis induced by TRAIL . Moreover , they demonstrate that cystatin B stabilizes FLIPL by interfering with its interaction with the E3 ligase Itch , thus preventing Itch-mediated proteasomal degradation of FLIPL in melanoma cells . The cysteine proteases , cathepsin B and L , have been reported to contribute to apoptosis induced by various stimuli including TRAIL in a number of cell types.11�13,23 However , inhibition of cathepsin L did not have any effect on TRAIL-induced apoptosis Supplementary Figure 2 , whereas inhibi-tion of cathepsin B partially blocked apoptosis induced by TRAIL in only two ME4405 and Mel-AT of eight melanoma cell lines Figure 2b . It should be noted that the two lines were most sensitive to TRAIL Supplementary Figure 1A , even though there was no overall correlation between the levels of cathepsin B expression and sensitivity of melanoma cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis data not shown . This puts forward a testable premise that involvement of cathepsin B may enhance the sensitivity of melanoma cells to apoptosis induced by TRAIL . The mechanism by which cathepsin B is involved in TRAIL-induced apoptosis in some but not most melanoma cell lines remains unknown , but it may be related to the levels of cathepsin B expression as ME4405 and Mel-AT contained the highest levels of cathepsin B among the cell lines Figure 2a . Another possibility is that the mechanism s responsible for permeabilizing lysosomes does not operate similarly in melanoma cell lines.10,12 In this regard , activation of the BH3-only protein , Bim , has been shown to mediate permeabilization of lysosomes in cholangiocarcinoma cells.12 However , siRNA knockdown of Bim did not block TRAIL-induced apoptosis in ME4405 cells data not shown , suggesting that failure of cathepsin B to contribute to TRAIL-induced apoptosis is unlikely because of inhibition of Bim . Although it is of interest to address these questions , our focus of this study was to investigate the cathepsin-independent mechanism by which cystatin B protects melanoma cells from TRAIL-induced apoptosis . Despite the absence of involvement of cathepsin B and L in TRAIL-induced apoptosis in most melanoma cell lines , cystatin B , a well-established endogenous inhibitor against cysteine cathepsins , 10,14 appeared to protect against apop-tosis induced by TRAIL . This was demonstrated in two melanoma cell lines deficient in cystatin B established by stable knockdown with shRNA , and was further confirmed by siRNA knockdown of cystatin B in another two melanoma cell lines Figure 1b , c , and e . Sensitization of melanoma cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis by inhibition of cystatin B was related to enhanced activation of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway , and more importantly , related to enhanced activa-tion of caspase-8 and increased association of caspase-8 and FADD Figure 3 , suggesting that cystatin B may inhibit recruitment of caspase-8 to the DISC , thus blocking TRAIL-induced apoptotic signaling transduction . Cystatin B-mediated inhibition of TRAIL-induced activation of caspase-8 appeared associated with the regulation of FLIPL expression , in that the levels of FLIPL were decreased in melanoma cells deficient in cystatin B , but were increased when cystatin B was overexpressed Figure 4c and d . As a structural homologue of caspase-8 , FLIP competes with caspase-8 for binding to FADD , thereby inhibiting recruitment of caspase-8 to the DISC.5,6 However , our previous studies have shown that there was no general correlation between the levels of FLIP expression and TRAIL-induced apoptosis in melanoma cells.23 Nevertheless , in this study , inhibition of FLIP enhanced , whereas overexpression of FLIPL or FLIPS blocked , TRAIL-induced apoptosis in melanoma cells Figure 4a and b , indicating that FLIP indeed has a part in regulation of sensitivity of melanoma cells to apoptosis-induced by TRAIL.4,24 As with FLIP , the levels of cystatin B expression did not appear to correlate in general with the sensitivity of melanoma cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis Supplementary Figure 6 . These observations reflect the complexity of regulation of TRAIL-induced apoptosis , and suggest that other mechanisms besides cystatin B and FLIP may operate cooperatively to protect melanoma cells from apoptosis induced by TRAIL.4 Although expression of FLIP can be regulated at multiple levels , 6,21,25 proteasomal degradation mediated by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway is one of the most important mechanisms.26,27 Consistent with this , inhibition of proteasomes readily increased the FLIPL protein levels in this study Figure 5a . Significantly , the half-life time of FLIPL in melanoma cells deficient in cystatin B was shortened , whereas it was prolonged in those overexpressing cystatin B Figure 5b and Supplementary Figure 5A and B . More-over , overexpression of FLIPL blocked the enhancement of TRAIL-induced activation of caspases and apoptosis in cystatin B-deficient melanoma cells Figure 5c and d . These results indicate that cystatin B impinges on turnover of FLIPL by stabilizing the protein in melanoma cells . Proteins modified by polyubiquitin chains are recognized and degraded by the proteasome.28 The specificity of the uniquitin-proteasome pathway is predominantly determined by the E3 ubiquitin ligase.28 In particular , the member of the homologous to the E6-AP carboxyl terminus HECT -containing E3 ligase family , Itch , is known to interact with FLIPL and mediate its degradation.21 We confirmed in this study that Itch interacted with FLIPL , but the amount of Itch associated with FLIPL reduced in melanoma cells overexpressing cystatin B , which was associated with decreased ubiquitination of FLIPL Figure 6a�c . Moreover , inhibition of Itch in melanoma cells deficient in cystatin B not only increased the levels of FLIPL but also reduced the increased sensitivity to TRAIL-induced apoptosis Figure 6d and e . In contrast , inhibition of Itch in melanoma cells overexpressing cystatin B did not provide further protection against apoptosis induced by TRAIL Figure 6f . Collectively , these results suggest a role for cystatin B in regulation of the interaction of Itch with FLIPL , which is , at least in part , responsible for sensitization of melanoma cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis by inhibition of cystatin B in melanoma cells . How cystatin B inhibits the Itch-FLIPL interaction remains unknown . One possibility is that cystatin B may bind to Itch and or FLIPL , thereby blocking their interactions . However , neither Itch nor FLIPL could be pulled down from whole-cell lysates with GST-cystatin B Figure 6g , nor could the two proteins be co-precipitated data not shown , suggesting that cystatin B may not physically interact with Itch or FLIPL in melanoma cells . Itch-mediated proteasomal degradation of FLIPL is known to be regulated by JNK-mediated Itch phosphorylation.21 Activation of Akt , PKC , and casein kinase CK2 has also been shown to protect FLIPL from proteasomal degradation.29�31 In addition , p53 has been reported to form a complex with Itch and FLIPL upon treatment with cisplatin that facilitated the downregulation of FLIPL in ovarian cancer cells.32 It is conceivable that cystatin B may interfere with the Itch�FLIPL interaction by impinging on one or more of these mechanisms . Potential regulation of Itch-mediated degrada-tion of FLIPL by multiple mechanisms may also account for the observation that there was no general correlation between the endogenous levels of FLIPL and cystatin B in melanoma cells Figures 1a , 4a and d . For example , similar levels of cystatin B were detected in both Mel-FH and Mel-RM cells , but Mel-FH cells expressed higher levels of FLIPL than Mel-RM cells . Regulation of FLIPL at levels besides post-translational degradation may also have a part in the lack of correlation between the expression of FLIPL and cystatin B.6,21,25 There is increasing evidence that cystatin B expression is elevated in cancer cells , which may serve as a biomarker for disease progression and prognosis of patients.14,16,17 However , the current understanding of the mechanism s of cystatin B action under physiological and pathological conditions remains largely confined to its ability to inhibit cysteine cathepsins.33 With regard to regulation of apoptosis , cystatin B-deficient mice are known to exhibit increased apoptosis of cerebella granule cells associated with increased expression of apoptosis genes , many of which are not the genes encoding cysteine cathepsins.34 Moreover , sensitiza-tion of cystatin B-deficient thymocytes to staurosporin-induced apoptosis has been shown to be independent of cysteine cathepsins.35 To our knowledge , this study is the first to show that cystatin B protects melanoma cells from TRAIL-induced apoptosis by inhibiting the interaction between Itch and FLIPL . Nonetheless , we do not rule out other mechanisms by which cystatin B may protect melanoma cells from apoptosis , such as inhibition of oxidative stress.36 Cystatin B deficiency has been reported to sensitize neurons to apoptosis mediated by oxidative stress.36 The latter is known to enhance TRAIL-induced apoptosis in various types of cells.37 In conclusion , we have shown in this study that cystatin B is an endogenous inhibitor of TRAIL-induced apoptosis of melanoma cells . This is , at least in part , because of the inhibition of Itch-mediated proteasomal degradation of FLIPL . These findings appear to be of practical signi-ficance , in that they provide a molecular basis for targeting cystatin B to enhance therapeutic efficacy of TRAIL in human melanoma .

20339376	www.nature.com cdd Polyglutamine polyQ pathologies are a family of dominantly inherited neurodegenerative diseases caused by mutations in which an expanded CAG repeat tract results in a long stretch of Qs in the encoded protein . This family includes Huntington Disease , Dentatorubral-pallidoluysian Atrophy DRPLA and several spinocerebellar ataxias . Apart from their polyQ repeats , the proteins involved are unrelated , and although they are all widely expressed in the CNS and peripheral tissues , they lead to distinct patterns of neurodegeneration.1 PolyQ-expanded proteins misfold and accumulate in large aggregates , which have been initially described as toxic , 1 and more recently as a positive prognosis factor in neuronal survival.2 The molecular and cellular mechanisms of toxicity due to polyQ proteins are not yet fully characterised and many of the principal aspects are under intense scrutiny . In particular , many reports have described autophagy as a protective cellular mechanism in neurodegeneration , 3 although its full contribution to the pathogenesis , including cell killing , is still poorly understood . The full cycle of autophagic degradation of cellular components and recycle of simpler constituents is not involved in cell killing . However , many dysfunctions at different steps of this cycle that have been reported upon expression of toxic proteins , including polyQ proteins , can lead to cell degeneration and death.4 Over the past few years a growing number of studies have focused on identifying the interplay between polyQ effects and protein-specific misfunctions , 5�7 with the assumption that polyQ pathologies combine general polyQ toxicity with disease-specific effects due to the proteins affected . The fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster has proved to be a valuable model organism for polyQ diseases and neurodegeneration.8 New models have also moved on from initial basic obser-vations , uncovering the complex interplay between polyQ effects and RNA or protein-specific misfunction.5,7,9 We generated several Drosophila models of DRPLA Figure 1a and Supplementary Figure 1 , a polyQ disease caused by mutations in atrophin-1.10,11 Atrophins are transcriptional co-factors conservedfrom Drosophila to mammals , 12�15 providing an ideal background for the dissection of polyQ effects and specific Atrophin functions through Drosophila genetics . We show that polyQ Atrophins promote neurodegeneration with autophagic hallmarksbothinneuronalphotoreceptorsandglial cells . Through blocking lysosomal digestion , they hamper the beneficial effects of further autophagy induction in contrast to other proteinopathies . Thus , our data reveal a specific mechanism of toxicity of a polyglutamine disease and uncover a complex interplay of Atrophins with autophagy . Results Retinal degeneration by Drosophila Atro and human Atrophin-1 . The Drosophila Atrophin gene Atro encodes a large ubiquitous protein containing all the functional domains of Atrophins , including two polyQ stretches.12,14 We have Q26 Q65 expanded either stretch to engineer the Atro75QN and the Atro66QC proteins Figure 1a and Supplementary Figure 1 . The former carries a 75Q stretch in the middle of a polyprolin domain , in a position similar to where the Q stretch is found in human Atrophin-1 At-1 , whereas the latter carries a 66Q stretch at the C-terminal end at a position where there is a Q stretch not conserved with human At-1 . Both Atro proteins are able to rescue Atro embryonic lethality , albeit with slightly different efficiency Supple-mentary Table 1 , indicating that polyQ expansion does not cause generalised loss of Atro function . Overexpression in the eye with GMR-Gal4 of Atro75QN or Atro66QC induces progressive depigmentation Figure 1b , commonly observed in neurodegenerative models in the eye . In addition , expression of Atro only in the adult eye using the Rhodopsin1 Rh1 driver is sufficient for degeneration , which is visible in terms of loss of photoreceptor cells specifically due to ageing Figure 1c and Supplementary Figure 1 . The latter experiment also shows that photo-receptor degeneration is strictly cell-autonomous as R7 , the only cell that does not express Rh1-Gal4 , is never lost Figure 1c , arrows . With GMR-Gal4 , it is possible to observe , in horizontal head sections , generalised tissue consumption , which leads to dramatic retinal collapse Figure 5 , see also figure legend . This is specifically observed with ageing as all Atro-expressing flies display a correctly sized retina when they eclose from the pupal case data not shown . In all these assays , Atro75QN results in a more severe phenotype despite lower full-length expres-sion levels when compared with Atro wt and Atro 66QC Supplementary Figure 1 . Interestingly , Atro wt also induces statistically significant photoreceptor loss and retinal con-sumption , although at a much lower level than its polyQ counterparts Figures 1c and 5b . This raises the possibility that degeneration induced by polyQ Atro is a combination of polyQ toxicity and the detrimental effects of Atro itself . As previously reported , 16 and similar to fly Atro proteins , a human At-1 fragment with a polyQ expansion At-1-65QDC , which accumulates in DRPLA patients and has been shown to be an At-1 form of extreme toxicity17 induces progressive eye depigmentation Figure 1b and retinal collapse Figure 5c when expressed in the fly retina . Surprisingly expression of full-length human At-1 does not promote any major degen-eration of the fly retina , also when carrying a 65Q tract Figures 1b and 5c . Interestingly , full-length At-1 , regardless of polyQ length , is expressed at low levels despite normal mRNA expression levels Supplementary Figure 1 , and this could explain the lack of a dramatic effect in the retina . The mechanism responsible for the low At-1 levels is unknown , but it does not involve protein degradation through the protea-some or through macroautophagy Supplementary Figure 2 . As the highly expressed DC transgenes derive from the full-length ones , differential translation efficiency is also unlikely , as they share the very same 50UTR and beginning of the ORF up to the point of deletion aa 917 . Finally , intracellular aggregates , a hallmark of polyQ diseases , are formed upon polyQ Atrophin expression Supplementary Figure 3 . We have analysed in detail those formed by At-1-65QDC and found that this protein is able to recruit in its heavily ubiquitinated aggregates the endogenous fly Atro general transcription factors such as the TATA-box Binding Protein TBP chaperones such as Hsp70 Nervy the Drosophila orthologue of Atrophin-1 interactor ETO MTG818 and chromatin-modifying enzymes such as the histone deacetylase Rpd3 . However , the co-repressor Sin3A , often found in the same complex with Rpd3 , and Mi-2 , part of the NuRD chromatin remodelling complex , is not enriched in aggregates , indicating that these have a specific content rather than being a general protein trap . Glial cells are particularly sensitive to polyglutamine Atrophins . Neurodegenerative phenotypes in the DRPLA fly models are not restricted to retinal photoreceptors . Neuronal overexpression of fly Atro results in developmental abnormalities19 that severely affect viability . However , switching on polyQ Atro only during adult life specifically affects fly longevity . Both Atro75QN and 120 100 Atro66QC are toxic when expressed in the glia Figure 2a , albeit at different levels , whereas only Atro75QN is toxic in the neurons Figure 2b . This suggests that glial cells are particularly sensitive to fly polyQ Atrophins . Also , glial expression does not affect development and the reduction in viability is primarily due to expression in adult life Figure 2a and c , and Supplementary Figure 4 . Similarly , At-1-65QDC but not its wt counterpart reduces fly viability if expressed in neurons or in the glia Figure 2e and f , and Supplementary Figure 4 . Glial expression with two different drivers results in a stronger phenotype than in the case of neuronal expression . Interestingly , also , the low expressed At-1-65Q significantly reduces fly viability when driven in the glia but not in the neurons Figure 2e and f . Under the same conditions , flies expressing a form of human Huntingtin , Htt-exon-1-93Q , 20 show on the contrary faster mortality upon neuronal expression Supplementary Figure 4 . Thus , our viability assays indicate that polyQ Atrophins are toxic both in neurons and glial cells , with a noticeable sensibility of glial cells specific to polyQ Atrophins . In conclusion , all DRPLA fly models recapitulate typical polyQ toxicity but also suggest that protein-specific effects may modulate the phenotypes in comparison with other polyQ models . Accumulation of autophagic hallmarks in degenerating neurons and glia . It has been reported that part of the toxicity exerted by polyQ proteins results from a block in the proteasome.21,22 However , neither Drosophila nor human polyQ Atrophins impair proteasome functions extensively Supplementary Figure 5 . This suggests that although proteasomal impairment may contribute to their phenotype , their toxic effect is unlikely to be due to a massive block of the proteasome . Overexpression of Atro through mutations in the microRNA mir8 has been shown to promote apoptosis during larval neuronal development.19 In aged adult retinae , significant accumulation of TUNEL signal is detected only if polyQ Atrophins are expressed in all eye cells with the GMR driver but not when the Rh1 driver is used to express the Atro proteins specifically in photoreceptor neurons Supplementary Figure 5 . Although these data confirm that polyQ Atrophins can stimulate apoptosis in developing tissues and non-neuronal adult eye cells , apoptosis does not appear to be chiefly responsible for the degeneration of adult post-mitotic photo-receptor neurons . TUNEL signal , in fact , correlates well with depigmentation , which could be due to apoptotic death of pigment cells . At a finer level of analysis , electron microscopy EM of degenerating photoreceptors shows that wt Atro promotes the formation of autophagic vacuoles , which are rarely found in control retinae Figure 3a . PolyQ Atrophins induce the formation of innumerable typical autophagosomes that cluster together and fuse with electron-dense lysosomal compart-ments to form large autophagolysosomes Figure 3a . Accu-mulation of similar autophagic organelles is also found in glial cells expressing polyQ Atrophins just before organism death Supplementary Figure 6 . In addition , many mitochondria show abnormal morphology , although they are hardly present in strongly degenerated tissue Figure 3a . The presence of autophagic organelles is confirmed for Atro66QC and Atro75QN by punctuated staining in the retina for GFPH Atg8a , a marker for autophagy Figure 3b .23 GFPHAtg8a clustering in Atro wt is present but less substantial , in agreement with the electron microscopic analysis Figure 3b . In conclusion , autophagosomes and autophagic markers dramatically accumulate inside cells expressing polyQ Atrophins , TorTED Atro wt suggesting a major role for autophagy in this form of cellular degeneration . Neurodegeneration is not rescued by further induction of autophagy . Having established the presence of autophagy , we further analysed its functional significance for neurodegeneration in the DRPLA flies . Blocking the signal responsible for autophagy induction23 by generating mutant clones for atg1D3D a deletion of 966 bp that includes the Atg1 translation start site23 and thereby a putative null allele leads to an increase in the degeneration caused by polyQ Atro Figure 4a , showing that endogenous autophagy attempts at protecting from neurodegeneration , as reported in other models . This is confirmed by enhancement of Atro retinal degeneration after RNAi-mediated downregula-tion23 of Atg5 , a principal autophagy factor Figure 5b . Atg5IR also enhances fly mortality due to glial expression of polyQ Atrophins Supplementary Figure 7 . On the contrary , over-expressing the chaperone dHdj1 significantly suppresses polyQ Atro toxicity in both assays Figure 5b and data not shown . This indicates that it is possible to rescue the DRPLA flies through another mechanism known to protect from polyQ toxicity and argues for the specificity of the effect observed with atg5IR . Autophagy is controlled by the Tor-signalling pathway in response to several stimuli , 3 and induction of further autophagy through inhibition of the Tor pathway has been reported to alleviate a number of neurodegenerative condi-tions.24�27 However , in our model , expression of a dominant-negative form of the Tor kinase , TorTED , a strong inducer of autophagy , 23 enhances retinal degeneration by all Atro forms Figure 5b . In addition , TorTED expression further reduces the vitality of flies expressing At-1-65Q in the glia Figure 2d and results in lethality at larval stages when coexpressed in the glia with At-1-65QDC and any Drosophila Atro form data not shown . On the contrary , TorTED has no effect per se on viability and longevity if expressed in the glia under the same conditions Supplementary Figure 7 . Likewise , addition of 1 mM rapamycin , a potent inhibitor of Tor , in the fly food leads to significant and highly reproducible decrease in the number of photoreceptor cells per ommati-dium in flies expressing Atro75QN Figure 4b and Supple-mentary Table 2 . Fly development was delayed by approximately 3 days on rapamycin treatment as previously described , 23 indicating that the drug is effective under the conditions we used . Flies expressing human Htt-exon-1-93Q treated in parallel under the same conditions show small rescue Supplementary Figure 7 . Finally , rapamycin also enhances the mortality of flies expressing Atro75QN in the glia with the repo driver and heterozygous for the null TorDP mutation Supplementary Figure 7 . More direct stimulation of autophagy downstream from Tor , by overexpression of the atg1 gene , brings about an even more dramatic enhancement of retinal degeneration by all Atro forms Figure 5b . We have used for this assay a weak UAS-Atg1 stock , 28 obtained by insertion of the Gene Search transposon GSV6 upstream of the atg1 gene , whose moderate expression does not affect retinal consumption per se Figure 5b . In conclusion , our data indicate that although endogenous autophagy has a crucial role in moderating polyQ Atrophin toxicity , further induction of autophagy does not rescue the neurodegeneration of our DRPLA fly models , differently from what has been reported for other Drosophila neurodegenera-tion models.24,27 Atro wt Atro66QC Atro75QN w Atro75QN s Autophagic digestion is blocked at the lysosomal level . Vacuoles formed upon Atro overexpression appear to be characteristically filled with unstructured partially degraded debris . On the contrary , expression of TorTED or Atg1 promotes the formation of autophagic vacuoles that appear empty Figure 3a and Supplementary Figure 6 . In addition , autophagosomes fused with the dark electron-dense lysosomes still retain their inner membrane Figure 3a , which is normally readily degraded . These structures form when complete digestion of auto-phagolysosomes is being blocked with lysosomotropic agents.29 These data therefore suggest that Atro is partially blocking or abnormally delaying autophagy at the level of digestion of autophagosomes . One possibility to explain the lack of digestion is that autophagosomes are not able to fuse correctly with lyso-somes . However , in dissected single ommatidia in culture , many GFPHAtg8 punctae , which accumulate upon ex-pression of Atro wt and more strongly upon Atro75QN expression , colocalize with lysotracker-positive compartments Figure 6a , indicating that fusion between autophagosomes and lysosomes is functional in these cells and that an eventual block of the autophagic flux is subsequent to the formation of autophagolysosomes . Also , lysotracker staining indicates correct acidification of autophagolysosomes . In fact , expression of all forms of Atro elicits massive accumulation of large acidic compartments , positive for lysotracker staining both in adult ommatidia and in imaginal discs Figure 6a and Supplementary Figure 8 . The small bright dots visible in the 5hrs 0.3 red lyostracker channel also in control ommatidia , however , are an artefact due to pigment granules that remain attached to dissected photoreceptors Supplementary Figure 8 . These data suggest increased lysosomal storage as a result of an Atrophin-specific effect . Indeed , autofluorescent ageing pigments such as lipofuscin , a product of unsaturated fatty acid oxidation associated with several lysosomal pathologies , that can be visualised by autofluorescence at 488 nm , 30 accumulate in large vesicles in dissected single ommatidia that express Atro75QN Figure 6b . Likewise , the Drosophila polyubiquitin-binding protein Ref 2 P p62,31 a multifunctional scaffold protein that marks ubiquitinated protein aggregates destined to degradation through the autophagic�lysosomal machinery , 32 accumulates in a number of small and large bodies upon wt Atro and , more conspicuously , upon polyQ Atro overexpression Figure 6c . To measure lysosomal activity as a whole , we have established a biochemically amenable system on the basis of cultured Drosophila BG3 cells , a neuronal line derived by larval CNS , which can be transiently transfected with an efficiency of B20 % Supplementary Figure 9 . In addition , these cells already express Atro endogenously Supplemen-tary Figure 9 . Therefore , in consideration of all these properties , BG3 cells constitute an ideal setup to complement and extend our in vivo observations in an in vitro system . Exogenous Atro mutants were overexpressed by using the Gal4 UAS system with the same vectors pUAST-based that we used to make our DRPLA transgenic flies and a CuSO4-inducible promoter present in the pMT-Gal4 plasmid Supple-mentary Figure 9 . In this neuronal cell culture , we have measured bulk protein degradation upon radioactive labelling . This is the best established assay for monitoring , independently of any substrate and of autophagy , the function of lysosomes in degrading long-lived 44 h half-life proteins.33 Cells transfected with Atro75QN are significantly impaired or slower than control-transfected cells in degrading , after 24 h of chase , the radioactivity present at 5 h of chase in trichloroacetic acid TCA -insoluble protein pellets Figure 6d . These data , taking into account the transfection efficiency , indicate a strong deficiency in the degradation of long-lived proteins by the lysosomes upon expression of polyQ Atro . Finally , in agreement with the hypothesis of lysosomal blockage , coexpression of TorTED or Atg1 with Atro75QN in the fly retina generates gigantic electron-dense autophagoly-sosomes with little sign of content digestion Figure 3a and Supplementary Figure 6 , which may explain the lack of rescue by additional induction of autophagy . Discussion In conclusion , our study suggests that neurodegeneration in the DRPLA flies results from partial inhibition or delay of autophagic digestion that shares many similarities with lysosomal storage disorders.30,34 We have generated new animal models for DRPLA in D. melanogaster . The DRPLA mouse models generated in the past35,36 have been shown to recapitulate much of the human pathology but they are less flexible and genetically amenable than Drosophila , which has proved to be a valuable tool for dissecting the polyQ pathology.8 Our new fly models will allow faster analysis of several aspects of DRPLA neurodegeneration , also allowing detailed comparison with other polyQ disease models . Thanks to the high structural and functional conservation in the Atrophin family , our observations are likely to be relevant to the human disease . In this report , we focus on the cellular mechanism of degeneration and highlight the role of autophagy and the specific deregulations due to polyQ Atrophins . On expression of polyQ Atrophins , autophagosomes and their markers are readily detected in neuronal and glial cells . PolyQ proteins have been described to strongly induce autophagy , 24 and this may explain the markedly increased presence of autophagic organelles upon polyQ Atrophin expression in comparison with wt Atro . However , this phenotype may result as well from a block in clearance , 34 making it impossible to establish the actual rate of autophago-some formation . Indeed , we report that Atrophin expression impairs lysosomal degradation but not fusion between autophagosomes and lysosomes or correct acidification of autophagolysosomes . In photoreceptor neurons that express Atrophin mutants , there is an increase in lipidic lysosomal storage as detected by the autofluorescent lipofuscin pigment and abnormal accumulation of poly-ubiquitinated proteins destined to be degraded by the autophagy�lysosome system , as detected by p62 . Finally , neuronal Drosophila cells transfected with polyQ Atro are defective in degradation of the lysosomally targeted long-lived proteins . A similar accumulation of correctly acidified , but not degradative , autophagolysosomes has also been reported to impair autophagic flux in mammalian cells as a result of incorrect maturation of the autophagolysosomes.37 Further investigations will be required to identify the mechan-ism through which lysosomal digestion is impaired however , we show that this is an intrinsic property of Atrophin , which may account for the degenerative effect of wt Atro and may significantly modulate the toxicity of polyQ Atrophins . Autophagy has been reported to exert a protective function under a number of neurodegenerative conditions.24�27 Con-sistent with these reports , we find that blocking endogenous autophagy induction enhances neurodegeneration by Atro-phins , as suggested by the atg1 clones . However , we have been unable to rescue Atrophin-mediated neurodegeneration through pharmacological or genetic induction of further autophagy . This is unique to the DRPLA flies in comparison with several other models of proteinopathies . At the ultra-structural level , further autophagy in the presence of Atrophin results in the formation of gigantic autophagolysosomes with little sign of content digestion . This provides an explanation for the lack of rescue as the full autophagy cycle can not be completed . However , we find that blocking autophagy is also detri-mental to cells undergoing neurodegeneration by Atrophins . Thus , both blocking endogenous levels of autophagy and inducing further autophagy lead to stronger or faster degeneration . This apparent paradox can be explained either by implying that autophagy is not completely blocked by polyQ Atro or that the early events leading to autophagosome formation may themselves have a protective function . Also , in the absence of digestion , autophagosomes may indeed sequester potentially toxic material from the cytoplasm . We can not however rigorously test these two hypotheses with the tools currently available . Damaged mitochondria , which represent an important target of autophagy , may also contribute to cellular degenera-tion by Atrophins through impaired energy metabolism . Their disappearance , as well as that of most cytoplasmic content in blocked autophagic vesicles , may represent the final step in this form of autophagic neurodegeneration . Autophagic degeneration by polyQ Atrophin is also induced in glial cells , where many of the observations made in photoreceptor neurons hold true . In addition to cell degenera-tion , expression of polyQ Atrophins in glial cells promotes pathology at the organismal level , leading to premature death , preceded by manifest locomotor deficits data not shown . Toxicity upon glial expression is a common feature of several polyQ fly models38,39 and , interestingly , a recent report shows that in Huntington Drosophila models , glial cell degeneration affects fly viability , but through a different pathway than the one involved in brain neuronal toxicity.40 Remarkably , photo-recteptors are affected by Huntingtin through the same pathway that affects the glia however , glial cells appear to be more sensitive to expression of polyQ Atrophins in comparison with polyQ Huntingtin , which instead elicits a stronger effect when expressed in neurons . The contribution of glial cells to the progression of neurodegeneration through the non-cell autonomous effects on neurons is an important subject of current investigations and it has been conclusively shown in the case of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis ALS and Spino Cerebellar Ataxia 7 SCA7 .41,42 It is likely that glial cells are crucial also for most polyQ diseases , given that polyQ proteins are also expressed in the glia . In DRPLA , there is evidence that glial pathology is particularly important as intracellular aggregates have been detected in the glia and there is a significant correlation between glial cell death and degeneration of brain white matter.43,44 An important caveat of our DRPLA flies , which applies to all Drosophila models of polyQ diseases , is that they are based on overexpression of mutant proteins that are known to misfold as a consequence of polyQ expansion . Many of the described phenotypes could be a consequence of this artificial condition and our results will require validation in other model organisms , under expression of mutant Atrophins at endogenous levels . However , we report impor-tant differences with respect to other polyQ fly models , which are also based on the overexpression of misfolded polyQ proteins . This argues for the specificity of the degenerating mechanism described here . Thus , our new DRPLA fly models will be extremely useful to further dissect the role of the autophagic flux and of the glial contribution in neurodegeneration , and also as a means to explore new potential therapeutic approaches to DRPLA and related diseases . Materials and Methods Genetics . The following mutant fly stocks have been used dEAAT1-Gal4 , En-Gal4 , GMR-Gal4 , Rhodopsin1-Gal4 , Tub-Gal4 , Ptc-Gal4 , Act5-Gal4 , Elav-Gal4 , Repo-Gal4 , UAS-NLSLacZ , UAS-GFPNLS , UAS-dHdj1 , UAS-Atg5IR , UAS-Atg1GS10797 , UAS-DTS5-1 , UAS-Htt-ex1-93Q , UAS-TorTED , UAS-Rheb , UAS-Tsc1IR , UAS-GFPHAtg8a , ubi-Gal80ts , atg1D3D , Atro35 , and Atroj5A3 . Rapamycin food . Fly-food was prepared according to our standard cornmeal recipe and DMSO or rapamycin Sigma , St. Louis , MO , USA dissolved 500 mg ml in DMSO was added before preparing aliquots in 1 500 dilutions . Flies were crossed first on standard food at 18 1C , until early first instar larvae were visible . The adult population was then split in two and was allowed to lay eggs on either DMSO or rapamycin food at 18 1C . On pupal eclosion , F1 adults were transferred at 29 1C on fresh DMSO or rapamycin food and flipped in a corresponding new vial every 48 h . The embedded eyes of different genotypes were then sectioned and analysed in a blind manner and in one out of three independent experiments in a double blind manner . Molecular cloning . DNA was cloned by standard techniques and by using a Gateway recombination system Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA , USA . Full-length or truncated atrophin-1 cDNAs encoding the first 917 amino acids At-1-DC or At-1-65QDC were generated by PCR using full-length human atrophin-1 cDNAs At-1 or At-1-65Q a gift from David R Borchelt as templates , and cloned into pUAST to generate UAS-At-1DC and UAS-At-1-65QDC . To generate ubi-HAHAt-1-DC , an At-1DC cDNA was cloned into the transformation vector pCaSpeR-UP-HA using the Gateway recombination system Invitrogen . For Drosophila Atro , a region containing the 65 CAG repeats of the At-1 cDNA was amplified by PCR using oligos that insert an SpeI site upstream from the CAG stretch and a BamHI site downstream from it . An XbaI�BglII 1.4-kb fragment of Atro was mutagenised by PCR and a Gene Tailor Invitrogen to introduce an SpeI and a BamHI site flanking the endogenous Q11 N-terminal stretch . On insertion of the 65 CAG , the XbaI�BglII Atro fragment was reinserted into the pUAST-Atro plasmid to generate pUAST-Atro75QN . A 0.9-kb NotI fragment of Atro was mutagenised to insert the SpeI and BamHI sites flanking the C-terminal region encoding for the Q14 stretch . Following insertion of the 65 CAGs , the NotI fragment was reinserted into the pUAST-Atro plasmid to generate pUAST-Atro66QC . Both Q stretches varied in length during cloning and two comparable stretches with similar expansion were chosen . All plasmids have been sequenced at MWG Biotech Ebersberg , Germany . More detailed construct information is available on request . RNA extraction and RT-PCR . RNA was extracted from 10�20 fly heads or BG3 cell pellets using an RNAgents kit Promega , Madison , WI , USA RNA quantity and quality were assessed using Nanodrop 1000 Thermo Scientific , Waltham , MA , USA . A 0.5-mg weight of RNA sample was retro-transcribed using OdT or random primers and SuperScript III Reverse Transcriptase Invitrogen to generate cDNAs that were used as PCR templates . For qPCR , we used the SYBR Green JumpStart Taq ReadyMix Sigma and 500 nM of specific primers for at-1 and rp49 . Amplification and at-1 versus rp49 quantification was performed using an IQ5 Bio-Rad , Hercules , CA , USA . Sequences of all the oligos are available on request . Histology and EM . For retinal semi-thin sections , adult heads were treated and sectioned as previously described.45 For electron microscopic sections , adult heads were dissected and fixed at RT in 4 % PFA and 2 % glutaraldehyde in 0.12 M sodium cacodylate buffer at pH 7.4 for 1 h . The heads were then washed 3 10 min in 0.12 M sodium cacodylate buffer , post-fixed in 2 % OsO4 in 0.12 M sodium cacodylate buffer for 1 h and washed again 3 10 min . Afterwards , samples were dehydrated through an ethanol series and infiltrated with propylene oxide , embedded in epoxy resin Fluka , Sigma and polymerized at 80 1C . Ultrathin 80 nm plastic sections were cut using a Leica UltraCut microtome using a diamond Diatome knife and post-stained with 2 % uranyl acetate , followed by treatment with Reynolds� lead citrate , and stabilized for transmission EM by carbon coating . Examination was performed with a Zeiss Leo 912 microscope at 100 kV . Images were captured using a Gatan 792 Bioscan camera using Digital Micrograph as the software . Immunohistochemistry. Larval imaginal discs and brains were treated as previously described.45 For Lysotracker staining , wing imaginal discs from third instar larvae were dissected in PBS and stained with LysoTracker Red DND-99 Molecular Probes , Invitrogen diluted 1 1000 in PBS for 10 s after 3 min of fixation in 3 % formaldehyde Polysciences Inc. , Warrington , PA , USA . Mounting was performed in Vectashield and samples were immediately visualized by fluorescence microscopy . Immunostainings of adult retina were performed with whole mount preparation . Aged eyes were dissected and fixed in 4 % formaldehyde in PBS for 1 h . The brain was removed approximately 30 min into fixation . Fixed eyes were then given three 10-min washes in PBST PBS plus 0.3 % Triton X-100 . The washed eyes were incubated in primary antibody in PBST plus 5 % goat serum overnight at 4 1C . The eyes were given three 10-min washes in PBST and incubated for 4 h at RT in secondary antibody followed by overnight staining in 2 mg ml rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin Sigma . After incubation , the eyes were given three 10-min PBST washes and mounted in Vectashield . TUNEL staining of fixed imaginal discs and adult retinae was performed using the DeadEnd kit Promega , according to the protocol from the supplier . Single ommatidia were dissected following a protocol described by RC Hardie.46 Briefly , adult retinae were grossly dissected in Schneider�s insect medium supplemented with 10 % foetal calf serum FCS . The dissected retina were then transferred in a drop of fresh new Schneider�s medium with 10 % FCS on glass slides and ommatidia were dissected with fine forceps . At this point , LysoTracker Red DND-99 Molecular Probes was added if required , and then most of the medium was removed with a pipette before adding Vectashield and sealing with a coverslip . All samples were imaged within 24 h .

The secondary fluorescence-conjugated antibodies from Molecular Probes or Jackson Laboratories Bar Harbor , ME , USA were used at 1 200 dilutions . The samples were viewed using Zeiss AxioplanII , Bio-Rad and Zeiss LSM confocal microscopes . Western blots . For flies , 10 fly heads were dissected , mashed directly in Laemmli buffer and boiled at 95 1C for 5 min . For cells , a T25 flask was harvested , pelleted and resuspended in Laemmli buffer . Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis , blotting and antibody staining were performed according to standard protocols . Amersham GE Healthcare , Piscataway , NJ , USA ECL reagents were used for chemiluminescence . The following primary antibodies were used anti-human Atrophin-1 APG840 1 500 and anti-Atro 1 200 . Cell culturesand metabolic labelling . Neuronal BG3 cells clone-1 were obtained from the Drosophila Genomics Resource Center and cultured in flasks with Shields and Sang M3 Insect Medium Sigma supplemented with 10 % FCS Gibco , Invitrogen , PenStrep and insulin . For the highest transfection efficiency B20 % , we used the Effectene kit Qiagen , Hilden , Germany . For radioactive metabolic labelling , cells at 50�70 % confluence were transiently transfected with Endofree�purified Qiagen , copper-inducible pMT-Gal4 and a molar excess two-fold of UAS vectors pUAST or pUAST-Atro75QN . After 24 h incubation in the transfection medium , each flask containing cells was incubated for 48 h in a radioactive medium containing 12.5 MBq of EasyTag EXPRE35S35S mix Perkin Elmer , Waltham , MA , USA and 1 mM CuSO4 . Thereafter , cells were incubated for 5 or 24 h with a chase medium containing 1 mM CuSO4 , then harvested and lysed in PBS ? 1 % Triton X-100 . Proteins were precipitated with 10 % TCA and resuspended in Laemmli buffer . The samples were loaded onto a 10 % SDS-PAGE gel , and the gel was dried and exposed to a phosphoimager screen . Signals were scanned using a Typhoon 8600 Molecular Dynamics , GE Healthcare and volumetrically quantified using the ImageQuant software . The radioactivity for each TCA pellet was standardised over the radioactivity present in the chase medium as secreted proteins that escape intracellular degradation . Finally , with these standardised values , the 24 5-h ratio was established for each transfection in each experiment according to the formula r ? P24 h M24 h P5 h M5 h .

20339378	A Garedew1 , SO Henderson1 and S Moncada* , 1 Activation of murine macrophages MF with interferon-g IFN-g and lipopolysaccharide LPS leads to a mitochondrial defect that is dependent on the release of large quantities of nitric oxide NO produced by the inducible NO synthase iNOS . This NO-dependent mitochondrial defect results in the complete arrest of mitochondrial ATP synthesis by oxidative phosphorylation OXPHOS . In this situation , macrophages upregulate glycolysis by several fold to gen-erate more ATP . In spite of this increase , the demand for energy of activated MF is such that the cellular [ ATP ] is reduced by approximately 40 % after 12 h . However , at this time there is no difference in the viability of control and activated MF.1 We have previously shown in Jurkat cells that after inhibition of respiration by exogenous NO , or by endogenous NO generated after treatment with anti-Fas antibody , there is upregulation of glycolysis and hyperpolarization of the mitochondrial membrane potential DCm .2,3 In subsequent experiments we showed that such hyperpolarization occurs only in cells capable of upregulating glycolysis , such as astrocytes , but not in neurons that are unable to do so.4 In the latter cells there is a rapid and progressive decline of DCm and increased apoptotic cell death . It is known that the onset of apoptosis is associated with a collapse in DCm and an alteration in mitochondrial matrix configuration , 5�7 leading to the release of pro-apoptotic proteins into the cytosol.8�12 Mitochondrial membrane hyperpolarization has been ob-served in cells of the immune system in which apoptosis has been induced by a variety of agents , including withdrawal of growth factor , 13 Fas signalling , 2,3,14 hypoxia , 15 T-cell activa-tion16,17 and staurosporine treatment.18 Increases in DCm were not observed , however , when other apoptosis-inducing agents , such as permeabilization of the outer mitochondrial membrane , 5,19 H2O220 and dexamethasone , 21�23 were used . Thus it is possible that mitochondrial membrane hyperpolar-ization is part of a defence mechanism , which precedes apoptosis , developed by glycolytically competent cells pro-vided that the mitochondria are not the primary target of the apoptosis-inducing agent . Such might be the case in activated lymphocytes from patients with systemic lupus erythemato-sus that have hyperpolarized mitochondria and are resistant to apoptosis.24 In such a situation , apoptosis would follow the failure of the cells to maintain DCm . To analyse whether the fate of cells is critically dependent on the regulation of the mitochondrial status , especially DCm , we decided to study the sequence of events that follows the increase , and later collapse , of DCm in J774.A1 MF activated for a period longer than the 12 h used previously.1 In this study we show that activated MF use significant amounts of glycolytically generated ATP to maintain the DCm of defective mitochondria that are unable to generate ATP . This is achieved through FoF1-ATP synthase and adenine nucleotide translocase ANT acting in reverse mode . Disruption of such a mechanism by inhibiting either of these enzymes leads to a collapse in DCm , translocation of the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein Bax to the mitochondria , release of cytochrome c into the cytosol , subsequent activation of pro-apoptotic caspases and apoptotic cell death . Results Effect of activation of MU on their DWm . Mitochondrial oxygen uptake respiration of IFN-g and LPS-treated activated MF was almost completely X95 % inhibited within the first 12 h not shown , an effect that was maintained throughout the experimental period of 72h Figure 1a . To distinguish the NO-dependent and NO-independent components of inflammation , some activated macrophages were treated with the NO synthase inhibitor , S-ethyl isothiourea SEITU 500 mM , at the time of activation . In activated ? SEITU-treated MF , respiration was higher than in controls 62.3�6.6 versus 51.4�2.5pmol O2 s 106 cells , but in both groups it could be reduced by approximately 70 % after treatment with oligomycin , indicating that the mitochondria are coupled to the same extent Figure 1a . Furthermore , treatment with p-trifluoromethoxy carbonyl cyanide phenyl hydrazone FCCP led to a maximal respiration rate that was similar in both groups 104�6.8 versus 97.6�7.2pmol O2 s 106 cells for control and for activated ? SEITU-treated cells , respectively . Despite the total inhibition of respiration , the DCm of activated MF , measured by tetramethyl rhodamine methyl ester TMRM fluorescence , was significantly increased from 742�75 a.u. of controls to 910�69 a.u . Figures 1b and c . The maintenance of DCm by the mitochondria of activated MF , whose respiration is completely inhibited by NO , points to the involvement of the reverse function of FoF1-ATP synthase . The DCm of activated ? SEITU-treated MF was also significantly higher than that of controls 1095�85 a.u. Figure 1d . Dependence of DWm on FoF1-ATP synthase in activated MU . Three treatment groups of cells control , activated , and activated plus SEITU-treated were incubated for 72 h and then treated with oligomycin 2 mg ml or bongkrekic acid 10 mM to inhibit FoF1-ATP synthase or ANT , respectively , while recording DCm using time-lapse confocal microscopy . Treatment with either compound led to a rapid and significant increase in DCm in the control and in the activated ? SEITU-treated MF Figures 2a and b . This effect was maintained for at least 12 h not shown . In contrast , treatment of activated MF with either compound led to an immediate fall in DCm to approximately 70 % Figures 2a and b . This was followed by a progressive decline to approximately 39�5 % within the next 60 min and to 15�4 % of the original values within 24 h not shown . The effect of oligomycin and bongkrekic acid on the DCm of activated MF could be observed from 12 h activation onwards , when respiration was almost completely 495 % inhibited . The TMRM fluorescence in all cell groups could be abolished by treatment with FCCP , indicating its specificity to DCm Figures 2a and b . We also used aurovertin B and atractyloside to inhibit FoF1-ATP synthase and ANT , respectively , and found that they gave similar results as oligomycin and bongkrekic acid not shown . In a separate group of experiments the three groups of cells were treated with antimycin A , rotenone or KCN . These respiratory chain inhibitors did not affect the DCm of activated MF but significantly reduced that of both control and of activated ? SEITU-treated groups see Figure 2c for result using antimycin A . Subsequent treatment with oligomycin or bongkrekic acid led to an immediate fall in DCm to approximately 65�70 % in all three groups Figure 2c this was followed by a progressive decline to 34�39 % of the initial values within 60 min . Further incubation for 24 h resulted in the reduction of DCm to 10�17 % of the initial values not shown . Effect of MU activation on ATP concentration . Three treatment groups of cells control , activated , and activated plus SEITU-treated were incubated for 12 h before treatment with oligomycin or bongkrekic acid to determine the relationship between MF activation , DCm and cellular [ ATP ] . Control MF had a steady-state cellular [ ATP ] of 10.1�1.51 nmol ATP 106 cells that fell to 5.7�0.59 nmol ATP 106 cells within 2 min of treatment with oligomycin Figure 3a . After a further 12 h , however , the [ ATP ] was restored to a value of 9.6�0.84 nmol ATP 106 cells Figure 3b . This was associated with upregulation of glycolysis , as showed by lactate accumulation in the medium during this period Figure 3c . Treatment of control cells with antimycin A had a similar effect on [ ATP ] and upregulation of glycolysis . Before oligomycin or antimycin A treatment , the [ ATP ] of MF activated for 12 h was 5.4�0.38 nmol ATP 106 cells i.e. , less than that in control cells however , in contrast with control MF , treatment with a.u . Oligomycin 400 TMRM a.u . Bongkrekic 400 TMRM [ a.u. ] 1000 Antimycin Oligomycin 400 TMRM oligomycin led to a significant increase of [ ATP ] to 7.7�0.73 nmol ATP 106 cells within 2 min this was maintained for the following 12 h . Antimycin A treatment did 12 10 -6 [ nmol.10 6 0 12 10 cells ] ATP 7 released 3 0 100 Activation 80 4 ATP Cellular 2 20 100 80 Activation Antimycin A 20 100 not change the [ ATP ] of activated MF . Glycolysis in these MF was already upregulated during the 12 h activation and was not further increased by treatment with oligomycin or antimycin A Figure 3c . Before oligomycin or antimycin A treatment , the [ ATP ] in activated ? SEITU-treated MF was comparable to that in control MF 9.7�1.10 nmol 106 cells and was reduced by treatment with oligomycin or antimycin A to 5.6�0.66 and 4.5�0.56 nmol 106 cells , respectively . However , unlike in control MF , the [ ATP ] of activated ? SEITU-treated cells remained low during the following 12 h Figure 3b , despite an increase in glycolysis Figure 3c . Bongkrekic acid treatment produced similar effects to oligomycin in all three groups of cells not shown . DWm and cell viability . Three treatment groups of cells control , activated , and activated plus SEITU-treated were incubated for 12h before treatment with oligomycin , bongkrekic acid or antimycin A. Control MF had a viability of X98 % throughout the experimental period and treatment with oligomycin or bongkrekic acid had no significant effect on cell viability Figure 4a . Activation of MF reduced viability to approximately 64 % within 72h . Treatment of activated MF with oligomycin reduced the viability to 35 % by 48h and to 0 % by 72h Figure 4a . Activated ? SEITU-treated MF had a viability of approximately 86 % at 72h . Oligomycin treatment reduced the viability of these MF to 12 % by 48h and to 0 % by 72h Figure 4a . The effects of bongkrekic acid treatment were similar to those of oligomycin in all treatment groups not shown . Antimycin A treatment of activated ? SEITU-treated MF reduced the viability to 10 % by 48h and 0 % by 72h but had no effect on the viability of activated MF Figure 4b . To assess the extent of dependence of activated MF on glycolytically generated ATP for survival , we switched to a medium in which galactose was the sole source of carbo-hydrate , after 12 h activation . The conversion of galactose to pyruvate does not yield net glycolytic ATP thus , cells need functional mitochondria to survive in such a medium . The viability of control MF was not affected by replacement of glucose in the medium with galactose . In contrast , such treatment led to cell death 498 % of activated MF within 8 h , whereas incubation of activated ? SEITU-treated MF in this medium led to a gradual reduction of viability Figure 4c . Apoptosis and necrosis in activated MU after collapse of the DWm . After 12 h activation , cells were treated with oligomycin , bongkrekic acid or antimycin A and DCm and cell viability were assessed for 60 h using mitotracker red chloromethyl-X-rosamine CMXRos and annexin-V staining and flow cytometry analysis . None of the drugs had any effect on the viability of control MF Figure 5b . In activated MF , with no drug treatment , there was a progressive apoptotic cell death Figures 5a�d . Treatment of activated MF with oligomycin increased the number of apoptotic cells in a time-dependent manner , whereas antimycin A had no effect . In activated ? SEITU-treated MF , with no drug treatment , approximately 90 % of the cells were viable mitotracker red positive , Figure 5b . However , treatment of these cells with oligomycin or antimycin A resulted in a progressive increase in both apoptosis and necrosis Figures 5a , d and e . MF activated for 12h and transferred to medium with galactose as the sole carbohydrate source died rapidly by necrosis approximately 85 % of cells were annexin-V negative and propidium iodide PI positive at 8 h after transfer , not shown . Activated ? SEITU-treated MF incubated in galac-tose medium died slowly by a combination of apoptosis and necrosis , and hence approximately 49 % of cells were annexin-V and PI positive apoptotic and 16 % were annexin-V negative and PI positive necrotic at 72 h not shown . Role of caspases in apoptosis of activated MU after collapse of DWm . Apoptosis can be triggered by extrinsic caspase 8-mediated and or intrinsic caspase 9-mediated pathways , both of which can lead to activation of caspase 3 and result in the degradation of cellular proteins . MF activation led to a slight increase in the enzymatic activities of caspases 3 , 8 and 9 . Treatment of 12 h activated MF with oligomycin to collapse the DCm triggered a rapid and pronounced activation of caspases 3 and 9 , but not of caspase 8 Figures 6a�c . A similar effect was obtained using bongkrekic acid not shown . Antimycin A treatment , which had no effect on the DCm of activated MF , did not increase their caspase activity . There was little caspase activity in 12 h activated ? SEITU-treated MF however , treatment with either oligomycin or antimycin A resulted in a delayed and gradual activation of caspases 3 , 8 and 9 Figures 6d�f . In activated MF that were treated with oligomycin , the activation of caspases coincided with translocation of the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein Bax to the mitochondria and the release of cytochrome c to the cytosol within 6 h of addition of oligomycin Figures 6g and h . In the activated ? SEITU treated MF , however , this happened to a lesser extent and after a long delay Figure 6h . Activated MF incubated in galactose medium died by necrosis and there was no significant activation of any of the caspases analysed not shown . In contrast , in activated ? SEITU-treated MF incubated in galactose medium , there was an approximately threefold activation of caspases 3 and 8 , but no significant activation of caspase 9 at 72h not shown . Discussion We have previously shown that in murine MF activated with IFN-g and LPS , respiration is completely inhibited by NO comp 102 FL2-H m ? ? CMXRos red Mitotracker comp 102 FL2-H 100 V 80 Annexin % 60 positive cells 40 negative red Mitotracker 20 % 100 80 and cells positive negative 60 V red 40 Annexin Mitotracker 20 within 12 h and that this inhibition can be prevented by blocking iNOS activity with SEITU . Despite inhibition of respiration , activated MF maintain high cell viability by switching to glycolytic metabolism.1 We now report that the DCm is maintained at a higher level in activated MF than in control MF , and that this protects the cells from apoptosis . In activated ? SEITU-treated MF the mitochondria are func-tional and the basal respiratory rate and DCm are significantly higher than those of control MF . Treatment of activated MF with respiratory chain inhibitors antimycin A , KCN or rotenone had no effect on DCm , showing its independence of respiration in these cells . Such treatment did , however , reduce the DCm of control and of activated ? SEITU-treated MF . Treatment of activated MF with oligomycin or bongkrekic acid led to the collapse of their DCm , indicating its dependence on a reversed function of FoF1-ATP synthase and ANT . In contrast , treatment of cells with respiring mitochondria i.e. , control and activated plus SEITU-treated MF with oligomycin or bongkrekic acid increased the DCm . Pre-treatment of control and of activated ? SEITU-treated MF with antimycin A induced a decrease in DCm in response to oligomycin or bongkrekic acid , similar to that in activated MF . Our observations can be explained by the fact that the NO-mediated inhibition of respiration in activated MF abolishes the translocation of H ? across complexes I , III and IV , leading to a transient drop in DCm . In response , the F1 subunit of FoF1-ATP synthase starts hydrolyzing mitochondrial ATP and drives the Fo-rotor to pump H ? out of the matrix.25 The resulting reduction in mitochondrial ATP ADP ratio favours reversal of the ANT function.26 The mitochondria of activated MF thus become consumers , rather than generators of ATP , further increasing the energetic demand of these cells . Oligomycin or bongkrekic acid-induced inhibition of ATP hydrolysis by mitochondria of activated MF led to a 30 % increase in the steady-state cellular [ ATP ] , suggesting that mitochondria use this quota of glycolytic ATP to maintain DCm . Treatment with antimycin A had no effect on the [ ATP ] of activated MF , as in these cells respiration was already inhibited by an NO-dependent mechanism . In contrast , treatment of control and of activated ? SEITU-treated MF with antimycin A or oligomycin led to an immediate fall in the cellular [ ATP ] . Although glycolysis was upregulated in the following 12 h in both cell groups , the steady-state cellular [ ATP ] was restored only in control MF after treatment with antimycin A. Thus , in activated ? SEITU-treated cells glycolysis can not fully compensate for the antimycin A-or oligomycin-induced loss of mitochondrial function because of the higher energetic demand incurred by their activation . Similarly , in activated ? SEITU-treated MF mitochondrial ATP generation can not compensate for the loss of glycolysis , as showed by the results of our experiments using galactose as the sole carbohydrate source in the medium . In the absence of glycolytic ATP generation , control MF were able to fulfil their energetic requirements by OXPHOS , whereas activated ? SEITU-treated MF gradually died , as their increased ATP demand could not be fulfilled by OXPHOS alone . Activated MF , whose mitochondria were already inhibited by NO , died by necrosis more rapidly when incubated in galactose medium . Activated MF underwent a basal level of apoptotic cell death that was associated with slight activation of caspases 3 and 8 , showing that apoptosis in these cells was mainly triggered by the extrinsic pathway for review see Kroemer et al.11 . Apoptosis was increased dramatically by collapsing DCm with oligomycin or bongkrekic acid this was associated with activation of caspases 3 and 9 , indicating activation of a mitochondria-dependent apoptotic pathway . Although SEITU protected activated MF from cell death , inhibition of respiration with oligomycin or antimycin A after 12 h activation induced significant cell death , and hence approximately 90 % of these cells were dead after 48 h by a combination of apoptosis and necrosis . This was probably due to the inability of the glycolytic ATP supply to fulfil the increased energetic demand of these cells . Because of the absence of NO and hypoxia-inducible factor-1a HIF-1a , the potent activators of glycolysis , the glycolysis of activated ? SEITU-treated MF is upregulated only by approximately 2.5-fold , compared with approximately sixfold upregulation in activated MF.1 Inhibition of glycolytic ATP generation by incubating these cells in galactose medium also led to gradual cell death , indicating that the increased ATP demand has to be fulfilled by OXPHOS and glycolysis . Inhibition of either glycolysis or respiration thus compromises the ATP supply and survival of these cells . The exact mechanism by which the collapse in DCm leads to the release of pro-apoptotic proteins into the cytosol and induces apoptosis is not yet clear . Furthermore , whether the collapse in DCm or the induction of apoptosis occurs first also remains a subject of controversy.11 Apart from OXPHOS , one of the functions of DCm is to facilitate the import of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteins , which are necessary for the maintenance of mitochondrial function and integrity.27,28 Thus , disruption of DCm may lead to loss of mitochondrial membrane integrity , release of pro-apoptotic proteins from the intermembrane space and subsequent activation of the caspase-mediated apoptotic pathway . In fact , it has been shown that the maintenance of DCm protects cells from death under apoptosis-inducing conditions.29 Moreover , oligomycin-mediated inhibition of FoF1-ATP synthase in activated 0.7 activity 0.6 Caspase-8 0.4 0.7 activity 0.6 ATPase- ? ? -tubulin 0.9 0.8 0.5 0.2 0.1 MF leads to the collapse of DCm and accumulation of H ? in the matrix , probably resulting in cytosolic alkalinization and matrix acidification . It has been shown that alkalinization of the cytosol leads to conformational changes in the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein Bax and results in the translocation of this protein to the outer mitochondrial membrane30�33 and subsequent release of pro-apoptotic intermembrane space proteins into the cytosol.34,35 Our results have shown that within 6 h of inhibition of FoF1-ATP synthase in activated MF , Bax is translocated to the mitochondria and cytochrome c is released into the cytosol , resulting in the activation of caspases . In summary , we have shown that activated murine MF , in which mitochondria are inhibited , use a considerable propor-tion of their glycolytically generated ATP to maintain their DCm to prevent apoptotic cell death . This response suggests that activated MF , which are already engaged in defence , are also forced to defend themselves against their own mitochondria . However , it remains to be investigated whether diversion of energy for this purpose , which is also likely to occur in cells other than MF that express iNOS , favours or is detrimental to the successful outcome of an inflammatory reaction . Materials and Methods Reagents . The cell culture medium Dulbecco�s modified Eagle�s medium , DMEM supplemented with 4.5 g l D-glucose , 2 mM L-glutamine 4 mM final and 25 mM HEPES , penicillin , streptomycin and L-glutamine were from Invitrogen Paisley , UK . Glucose-free DMEM was also obtained from Invitrogen , as were the potentiometric dye TMRM , the nuclear stain Hoechst 33342 , the dead-cell nuclear stain PI , Vybrant Apoptosis Assay Kit containing annexin-V conjugated to the green-fluorescent dye Alexa Fluor488 for labelling apoptotic cells and MitoTracker Red CMXRos for labelling polarized mitochondria and ApoTarget colorimetric caspase assay sampler kit for caspases 3 , 8 and 9 . Annexin V-conjugated to the green fluorescence dye fluorescein isothiocyanate FITC was from Biovision Inc Mountain View , CA , USA . LPS of the bacterial strain Staphylococcus typhosa 0901 was from Difco Surrey , UK , and murine IFNg was from Insight Biotech Wembley , UK . The lactate oxidase-based lactate assay kit was from Trinity Biotech Bray , Ireland , the luciferase-based ATP assay kit ATPlite was from Perkin Elmer Waltham , MA , USA . All other reagents were from Sigma-Aldrich Dorset , UK . Cell culture , activation and preparation of macrophages . The murine MF cell line J774.Al ATCC TIB 67 was maintained in suspension in stirrer bottles Techne , Burlington , NJ , USA in DMEM supplemented with 10 % FCS , 100 units ml penicillin and 100 mg ml streptomycin . The cell density was kept at p1 106 cells ml to maintain viability at X98 % . Cells were activated by resuspending them in stirrer bottles at a density of 0.5�0.8 106 cells ml in fresh medium containing 10 U ml murine IFN-g and 10 ng ml LPS . In one group , the activity of iNOS was inhibited by administration of 500 mM SEITU at the same time as IFN-g and LPS to distinguish the NO-dependent and NO-independent components of inflammation . In some experiments , oligomycin 2 mg ml , bongkrekic acid 10 mM or antimycin A 1 mM was added 12 h after activation with IFN-g and LPS and cells were incubated further . For experiments that involve incubation of activated cells in glucose-free medium , after 12 h of activation cells were spun down and resuspended in glucose-free DMEM supplemented with 20 mM galactose , 4 mM L-glutamine , 2 mM pyruvate , 10 % FCS , 100 units ml penicillin , 100 mg ml streptomycin and the corresponding treatments . The viability of activated cells incubated in galactose medium was determined every 2 h by the Trypan blue exclusion method . As activated MF have a high glycolytic metabolism , we preserved optimal cell viability by changing the medium every 24 h to avoid nutrient depletion and medium acidification . For lactate and nitrite determination , 1 ml aliquot of the cell suspension was taken immediately after changing the medium and after 24 h , spun down and the supernatant was stored at 41C until analysis . Respirometry measurements and biochemical assays . The respiration of activated cells was measured by taking a cell suspension of approximately 3 106 cells from each treatment group at 12 and 24 h after activation and every 24 h thereafter . The cells were spun down , resuspended at 2 106 cells ml in fresh medium and used in respirometry experiments after cell counting and viability determination . Intact cell respirometry , lactate , nitrite and ATP assays were performed as described previously.1 Confocal imaging and determination of mitochondrial membrane potential . A suspension of activated MF was removed from the stirrer bottles and seeded at a density of 0.1 106 cells 0.8 cm2 growth area of a chambered coverglass Lab-Tek , Nunc , Langenselbold , Germany and incubated for 12 h before confocal imaging . The medium was aspirated , the cells were rinsed with Dulbecco�s phosphate-buffered saline DPBS , 200 ml annexin-V binding buffer containing 10 ml annexin V-FITC ? 2 mg ml Hoechst 33342 ? 20 nM TMRM was added and cells were incubated for 15 min in the dark . Confocal microscopic images were taken with the UltraVIEW ERS Live Cell confocal Microscope Perkin Elmer with a 63 oil immersion objective . The cells were kept at 371C during the entire imaging period by a thermostatic chamber encasing the stage of the microscope . Data acquisition and further fluorescence analysis were carried out using UltraVIEW software . Whole cell fluorescence was analysed by marking individual cells in the field . Background fluorescence of a region without cells cell debris was subtracted from the fluorescence values . The role of the different respiratory chain complexes in maintaining DCm of activated and control MF was evaluated 72 h after activation by inhibiting the respiratory chain complexes I , III and IV with 1 mM rotenone , 1 mM antimycin A and 500 mM KCN , respectively , in separate experiments . In addition , mitochondrial complex V and ANT were inhibited with 2 mg ml oligomycin and 10 mM bongkrekic acid , respectively . In some experiments , as an alternative to oligomycin an inhibitor of the Fo subunit of FoF1-ATP synthase and bongkrekic acid an inhibitor of ANT in its closed configuration we also used 10 mM aurovertin B an inhibitor of the F1 subunit of FoF1-ATP synthase , and 500 mM atractyloside an inhibitor of ANT in its open configuration . The kinetics of action of the various inhibitors on DCm were studied by recording the TMRM fluorescence in time-lapse experiments . In brief , the steady-state TMRM fluorescence was recorded for 60 s to obtain a stable fluorescence signal . Subsequently antimycin A was added and the signal was recorded for approximately 100 s until a relatively stable signal was obtained . Oligomycin or bongkrekic acid was added and the signal was recorded for approximately 180 s . The DCm was finally collapsed completely with 25 mM FCCP . The FCCP concentration used here was approximately fivefold higher than that used to obtain maximal respiration , to ensure that the DCm was completely collapsed . To evaluate the roles of FoF1-ATP synthase and ANT on DCm of activated MF without previous addition of other mitochondrial inhibitors , oligomycin or bongkrekic acid was added after recording the steady-state TMRM signal for 60 s , and the fluorescence was recorded for a further 150 s . Flow cytometry analysis of mitochondrial membrane potential and cell death . Activated MF were stained with the required fluorochromes and prepared for flow cytometry according to the manufacturer�s recommendations . In brief , approximately 1 106 cells were removed from the stirrer bottles at different time points after activation , spun down and resuspended in 1 ml fresh medium containing 40 nM mitotracker red CMXRos , and incubated at 371C for 30 min . Cells were then spun down , washed once with 10 ml DPBS and resuspended in 100 ml annexin-V binding buffer that contained 5 ml annexin V-Alexa Fluor488 . They were then incubated at room temperature , in the dark , for 15 min and diluted with 400 ml annexin-V binding buffer before measurement . Apoptotic and necrotic control cells were obtained after treatment of control MF with 1 mM staurosporine and 2 mM H2O2 , respectively , for 4 h . Analysis of the stained cells was carried out with a dual laser flow cytometer FACSCalibur , Becton Dickinson , San Jose , CA , USA and data were acquired with CELLQUEST software . Single fluorochrome-labelled cells were used to correct for the spectral overlap between the green and red fluorescence . Furthermore , cell size and granularity data were acquired using the forward FSC and side light scatter SSC filters , respectively . For each sample , 1 104 cells were analysed . Caspase assay . Enzymatic activity of cysteine-aspartic acid proteases caspases in the cytosolic extracts of activated cells was determined spectrophotometrically by measuring the absorbance of free para-nitroaniline pNA as described by Talanian et al.36 Samples for caspase assay were collected by removing 20 ml cell suspension immediately after oligomycin antimycin A treatment and every 6 h thereafter . Cells were spun down , washed once with DPBS , resuspended in 500 ml chilled cell lysis buffer and incubated on ice 10 min for complete cell lysis . After centrifugation 10 000 g , 2 min , the supernatant was stored at 201C until analysis . Caspase assays were performed according to the manufacturer�s recommenda-tion Invitrogen . In brief , protein concentration in the cytosolic extract was determined using the bicinchoninic acid protein assay BCA assay , Pierce , Rockford , IL , USA and 200 mg protein was used for the assay , in triplicate , in a 96-well microplate using 400 mM caspase substrate . The reaction mixture was incubated for 2 h at 371C and the absorbance of free pNA was measured at 405 nm . The reaction mixture with the corresponding caspase substrates was used as a blank . All samples were assayed with the substrates for caspases 3 , 8 and 9 . Cell fractionation and detection of mitochondrial proteins . J774.A1 MF were grown in a suspension culture to approx . 0.8 106 cells ml in four 500 ml stirrer bottles Techne . Medium in the three bottles was renewed by spinning down cells and resuspending in a new medium 2 h before beginning the treatment . The cells in the fourth bottle were spun down and used for cytosol mitochondrial fractionation of control cells . Cells were activated by adding 10 U ml IFN-g and 10 ng ml LPS and incubated for 12 h . Cells in one bottle 12 h activation were harvested by spinning down and those in the other two bottles were treated with 2 mg ml oligomycin and incubated for a further 6 h 18 h activation and 18 h 30 h activation and harvested accordingly . The same experimental setup was repeated with the activated ? SEITU-treated cells . The cell pellets were lysed in isotonic buffer 70 mM sucrose , 200 mM mannitol , 1 mM EGTA , 10 mM Hepes , pH 7.4 supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail Roche , Basel , Switzerland by Dounce homogenization . Unbroken cells , nuclei and heavy membrane particles were sedimented by spinning at 1000 g and discarded . The supernatant , containing both the mitochondrial and cytosolic fractions , was spun at 12 000 g for 20 min to pellet the mitochondrial fraction . The supernatant from this high-speed centrifugation the cytosolic fraction was stored at 801C until needed . The pellet mitochondrial fraction was washed once with isotonic buffer and finally resuspended in RIPA lysis buffer 50 mM Tris-HCl , 1 % NP-40 , 0.5 % sodium deoxycholate , 0.1 % SDS , pH 7.4 supplemented with a protease inhibitor cocktail Roche . These cytosolic and mitochondrial fractions were used to determine translocation of the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein Bax into the mitochondria and efflux of cytochrome c into the cytosol after inhibiting FoF1-ATP synthase with oligomycin . Protein electrophoresis and western blotting . Protein concentration in the different samples was determined using the BCA Protein Assay Reagent . Sample aliquots were mixed with Laemmli buffer , boiled for 10 min , and 25 mg total protein was fractionated using a precast 4�15 % gradient SDS-PAGE gel electrophoresis Bio-Rad , Hemel Hempstead , UK . Proteins were transferred to Hybond-P PVDF membranes GE Healthcare , Amersham , UK and subjected to immunoblot assays using mouse monoclonal antibodies against ATPase-b Invitrogen , cytochrome c BD-Pharmingen , San Jose , CA , USA , Bax Sigma-Aldrich , a-tubulin Abcam , Cambridge , UK and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat antibody against mouse IgG Dako , Glostrup , Denmark at 1 2000 dilutions .

The incubation medium was replaced every 24 h with fresh medium containing the corresponding treatments . Inhibition of FoF1-ATP synthase with oligomycin led to a gradual death of both activated and activated plus SEITU-treated MF a , whereas antimycin A reduced the viability of activated plus SEITU-treated MF without affecting activated MF b .

20379196	Review After its first description as a nuclear protein engaged by the oncogenic SV40 large T antigen , and the realization , years later , that p53 is a powerful tumor suppressor , the scientific community has invested a formidable effort on understanding its function and regulation.1 p53 is a trans-cription factor whose activity is promoted by a wide range of stress signals potentially affecting genome integrity and proper cell proliferation once activated , p53 is capable of coordinating a complex cellular response that leads to cell-cycle arrest , DNA repair , senescence , or programmed cell death . For this crucial function , p53 was suitably dubbed the �guardian of the genome�.1 More than 15 years after discovery of p53 , two p53-related genes were iden-tified p63 and p73.2�4 Interestingly , p63 and p73 are struc-turally similar and functionally related to p53 , and hence the entire p53 family may be regarded as a unique signaling network controlling cell proliferation , differentiation , and death . In this study we present an overview of protein interactors of all p53 family members , with emphasis on their possible role in mediating integrated functions of the p53 pathway . For an update on the complexity of p53 activities and regulation , the reader is referred to specific recent reviews e.g. , Kruse and Gu5 , Vousden and Prives6 , Green and Kroemer , 7 and Menendez et al.8 . www.nature.com cdd L Collavin1,2 , A Lunardi1,2,3 and G Del Sal* , 1,2 All three p53-family proteins have a very similar domain organization , are expressed in a similar set of alternative isoforms , and are subject to similar post-translational modi-fications PTMs summarized in Figure 1 however , mouse models revealed important differences in their biological role , showing that p53-family paralogs have acquired a high degree of functional specificity since their duplication and divergence during evolution.9,10 p53-null mice are viable and largely normal in embryonic development , but die of cancer at young age , highlighting the crucial role of p53 in preventing formation of spontaneous tumors.11 Mild developmental and fertility defects can be detected with careful analysis.12,13 On the contrary , p73-null mice are born viable but have nervous system abnormalities , hydrocephalus , and immunological problems with chronic inflammation . p73-null mice also show reproductive and behavioral defects , and generally die within the first 2 months.4 p63-null mice are born alive , but die immediately after birth . They show a severe phenotype , lacking limbs and a wide range of epithelial structures including skin , prostate , breast , and urothelia , 2,3 indicating that p63 is required to maintain the pool of proliferating stem cells during development of epithelia.14,15 A Ac P P P S p53 is a powerful tumor suppressor , as proven by a wealth of in vivo models and dramatically confirmed by frequent mutation in human cancers see Hainaut et al.16Donehower and Lozano17 and references therein . The role of the other two p53-related proteins in tumor suppression is less obvious , because they are rarely deleted or mutated in cancer , and the respective knockout mice die tumor-free from developmental defects.2�4 Moreover , human syndromes with p63 mutations are not associated with higher tumor incidence.18 Nonetheless , a wealth of data show that both p63 and p73 have a role in tumor suppression . First of all , a careful analysis of the tumor predisposition of p63 and p73 hetero-zygous mice revealed a consistent connection with cancer . In fact , p63 ? � and p73 ? � mice develop spontaneous tumors , and show a median survival time that is only a few months longer than that of p53 ? � mice.19 Second , a number of studies showed that TAp73 and TAp63 can induce cell-cycle arrest , senescence , DNA repair , and apoptosis in response to chemotherapic drugs , independently of p53.20�22 Third , silencing of p73 and p63 increases the transforming potential of p53� � mouse embryonic fibroblasts.23 Fourth , even if not mutated , p63 and p73 are aberrantly expressed in cancer . In particular , DN isoforms of p63 and p73 are frequently overexpressed in a wide range of tumors , in which they associate with poor prognosis reviewed in Deyoung and Ellisen24 . Moreover , forced expression of DNp73 promotes transformation in experimental models.25,26 Thus , upregula-tion of DNp63 or DNp73 isoforms may be a common mechanism to inactivate the respective TA isoforms during tumorigenesis . Recently , generation of a mouse model with selective knockout of the TAp73 isoforms , with retention of DNp73 expression , conclusively established a role of p73 in tumor suppression.27 Developmental abnormalities are less severe in these mice , allowing detection of two important phenotypes increased tumor susceptibility and infertility . Both are ascrib-able to increased genomic instability and aneuploidy linked with mitotic spindle defects . Thus , maintaining genome integrity seems to be a key function of TAp73.27,28 Similarly , generation of a mouse model selectively lacking TAp63 isoforms uncovered a function for TAp63 in DNA damage-induced apoptosis of germ cells.29 In response to genotoxic stress , TAp63 is phosphorylated by cAbl and induces apoptosis of oocytes , having a crucial role in genome protection of the female germ-line.29,30 A more recent study established a function of TAp63 in mediating Ras-induced senescence and preventing tumorigenesis in vivo , in a model of p53-nullizygous mice.20 In addition , TAp63 has a crucial role in preventing invasiveness and metastasis of epithelial tumors by controlling expression of a crucial set of metastasis-inhibitor genes.31 Finally , it should be considered that oncogenic p53 mutants can directly or indirectly interact with p73 and p63 , interfering with their functions , to promote transformation , chemoresistance , and metastasis.31,32 Taken together , these evidences implicate all p53 family members in tumor suppression , yet highlighting their specifi-cities . In addition to intrinsic structural and biochemical differences , functional specificity of p53-related proteins may derive from selective interaction with specific regulators , or from interaction with common regulators that have different effects on each family member or isoform . In any case , the settings in which p53-family proteins are activated can profoundly affect the response of diverse cell types to oncogenic stress . Protein Interactions Modulate the Response of the p53 Pathway The tumor suppressive function of the p53 pathway resides largely in its capacity to sense potentially oncogenic stress conditions , and coordinate a complex set of molecular events leading to growth restraining responses . All steps of this pathway are controlled by regulatory interactions with positive or negative modulators , promoting p53 covalent modifica-tions , controlling its stability and subcellular localization , determining its specificity for selected promoters , or modulat-ing its transactivation potential . Other p53 interactors exert an effect further downstream to directly mediate p53 biological effects , for example , at the mitochondria . Accordingly , p53 is a highly connected protein and can form physical complexes with many cellular proteins . A search of public protein�protein interaction databases using the APID web interface http bioinfow.dep.usal.es apid index.htm currently retrieves more than 300 reported interactions involving human p53 , whereas dramatically fewer interactions are reported for the other family members Figure 2b . Such unbalance reflects a tremendous disproportion in the number of screenings conducted so far , and must not to be interpreted as a reduced propensity of p73 or p63 to form complexes with other proteins . We believe that the list of p73 p63 interactors will steadily grow as additional screens are performed . Interactors Regulating PTM of p53-family Proteins One important category of interactors is represented by enzymes that apply covalent PTMs on p53-and p53-related proteins , either activating or inhibiting their activity . The complex array of modifications of p53 , and how these modulate its activation and functions , have been extensively reviewed recently and will not be discussed in this study e.g. , Kruse and Gu5 and Vousden and Prives6 . Rather , we wish to point out that several PTMs are common to multiple p53 family members see Figure 1 and Table 1 , thus implying that p53 , p63 , and p73 are potentially responsive to a similar set of signals . Nonetheless , the same PTM may have different effects on the biochemical functions of each p53 family member , and a given upstream signal may result in a different biological output , depending on relative expression levels of the three p53-family proteins and their isoforms . A compre-hensive knowledge of regulatory modifications of all three p53-related proteins will improve our understanding of the behavior of the p53 pathway in different cell types , and perhaps allow development of better prognostic and thera-peutic strategies . Not too much , not too little Interactors Regulating p53-family Protein Levels The principal way in which p53 levels are controlled is by regulated degradation of the protein . Accordingly , ubiquitina-tion of p53 represents a �core control� on which many input signals converge . Perhaps less prominent is the role of protein turnover in the regulation of p73 and p63 , but a number of ubiquitin ligases are shared among p53 family members . MDM2 . The most important p53 regulator is the Ring domain E3 ubiquitin ligase MDM2 mouse double minute-2 . MDM2 recognizes a short region in the TA domain of p53 and interferes with its transcriptional activity at the same time , MDM2 interacts with the DBD region and ubiquitinates p53 , promoting its proteasomal degradation.33,34 As MDM2 is a transcriptional target of p53 , inhibition by MDM2 is part of a negative feedback loop on p53 activation.34 In addition to MDM2 , p53 is also bound and regulated by the MDM2-related protein MDMX also named MDM4 . MDMX does not induce p53 degradation directly , but can antagonize p53-dependent transcription.35 However , MDMX and MDM2 heterodimerize to augment p53 degradation , and hence both proteins can potentially influence p53 stability.36,37 Both MDM2-and MDMX-deficient mice die in utero as a consequence of p53 hyperactivity , showing the crucial role of these proteins in restraining p53 function during develop-ment.38,39 Not surprisingly , high levels of MDM2 or MDMX are found in many human cancers.40,41 MDM2 and MDMX also bind p73 , but MDM2 does not promote p73 ubiquitination.42,43 Rather , MDM2 relocalizes p73 to subnuclear speckles and represses p73 transcriptional activity by preventing its interaction with the acetyltransferase p300 CBP and RNA polymerase-associated factors.44,45 Interestingly , MDM2 can also catalyze addition of the small ubiquitin-like protein NEDD8 to both p53 and p73 , and also this modification inhibits their transcriptional activity.46,47 Less is known about the physical association of MDM2 and MDMX with p63 . Some researchers found lack of interaction for both MDM2 and MDMX , 48,49 whereas others were able to detect MDM2�p63 complexes , although reporting contra-dictory effects on p63 function.42,50 The crucial amino acids required for MDM2 binding are conserved in p63 , but molecular modeling suggests that other residues in the N-terminal domain of p63 may render this interaction significantly weaker.51 In line with its role as primary regulator of p53 , MDM2 stability , localization , and function are tightly controlled , and hence the p53�MDM2 core circuit responds to a multi-tude of signaling pathways , including DNA damage , onco-gene activation , and nucleolar ribosome stress see Kruse and Gu5 , Vousden and Prives6 and references therein . Similarly , stress-activated kinases can regulate MDMX activity.52 DBD PML 282 In addition to stress , the p53�MDM2 core circuit can also be regulated by physiological cues . An example is the Notch pathway , crucial for determination of cell fate , maintenance of stem-cell populations , and often deregulated in cancer . p53 can inhibit Notch signaling by both repressing transcription of Presenilin 1 and competing with Notch for interaction with the transcriptional co-activator MAML1.53 At the same time , Notch can negatively regulate p53 by modulating the p53� MDM2 core circuit in fact , Notch1 signaling increases MDM2 activity through downregulation of p14ARF and activation of the PI3K Akt pathway.54 In line with this antagonism , the endocytic protein Numb , which is asymmetrically partitioned at mitosis to control cell fate by antagonizing the activity of Notch , binds to both MDM2 and p53 , counteracting MDM2-dependent p53 ubiquitination and promoting p53 stabilization and activity.55 The p53�MDM2 core circuit also mediates a functional link between p53 and the Hedgehog signaling Table 1 A selection of enzymes that apply post-translational modifications on p53-family proteins , or were reported to physically interact with them , independently of modification Kinases GSK3-beta p38 PLK1 Phosphatases PP2A Wip1 Acetyltransferases De-acetylases HDAC1 2 Sirt1 Ubiquitin ligases Synoviolin Deubiquitinases Methyltransferases Smyd2 Demethylases LSD1 SUMO ligases Ubc9 + , Reported modification and or interaction � , reported experimental evidence of lack of interaction . aOnly evidences regarding p73 and p63 are referenced . Most regulatory modifications of p53 have been reviewed elsewhere5,135�137 pathway . In fact , constitutive activation of the Hedgehog pathway downregulates p53 by promoting MDM2 phosphory-lation and association with p53.56 As MDM2 binds multiple p53 family proteins , the many signaling pathways that impinge on the MDM2�p53 core circuit could in principle engage the entire p53 family in a coordinated cellular response . Other E3 ubiquitin ligases . In addition to MDM2 , several other ubiquitin ligases promote p53 degradation see Table 1 . Two such ligases , PIRH2 and COP1 , are direct transcriptional targets of p53 together with MDM2 , they are involved in a negative feedback loop to restore normal p53 levels after the stress response . On the contrary , several other E3 ubiquitin ligases can regulate p53 turnover in the absence of stress see Lee and Gu57 and references therein . Notably , MDM2 and MDMX are found only in vertebrates , whereas most of the other p53-specific ubiquitin ligases are conserved in simpler organisms such as Caernorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster . Currently , little is known on the potential activity of these ubiquitin ligases on Cep-1 or Dmp53 p53-like proteins of C. elegans and D. melanogaster , respectively . For example , the cytoplasmic ubiquitin ligase Synoviolin degrades both mammalian and Drosophila p53.58 Similarly , TRIM24 , a RING-domain ubiquitin ligase that degrades mammalian p53 , may be controlling p53 levels in Drosophila , as the TRIM24 knockout phenotype is rescued by knockdown of Dmp53.59,60 Considering that invertebrates have a single p53-like gene , it is possible that evolutionarily conserved ubiquitin ligases that degrade invertebrate p53 can bind and modulate p63 and or p73 in mammals . A proof of principle is set by FBXO45 , the mammalian ortholog of C. elegans FSN1 , an F-box protein that is involved in germ-line apop-tosis by regulating the p53-like protein Cep-1.61 In mam-malian cells , FBXO45 binds specifically to p73 and promotes its degradation by an SCF-dependent mechanism.62 WWP1 . p53-family proteins are also regulated by NEDD4-like ubiquitin ligases , characterized by one or more WW domains that recognize proline-rich sequences on target proteins . The ubiquitin ligase WWP1 binds a PY motif the PPxY sequence in the C-terminal region of p63 , and induces its ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal degradation.63 The presence of a conserved PY motif in p73 may be sufficient to predict a similar activity of WWP1 on this protein . Currently , binding and ubiquitination of p73 by WWP1 have been only reported as unpublished data.63 Very intriguingly , despite the lack of a canonical PY motif , WWP1 can also bind p53 this interaction produces a mono-ubiquitinated form of p53 that is retained in the cytoplasm , inhibiting its transcriptional activity.64 WWP1 is overexpressed in a significant fraction of breast and prostate tumors , and its activity on multiple p53-family proteins suggests a potential role in oncogenesis . ITCH . The NEDD4-like ubiquitin ligase , ITCH , binds p73 and p63 through interaction with the C-terminal PY motif , and promotes their proteasomal degradation . In contrast to WWP1 , it does not interact with p53.65,66 Both TAp73 and TAp63 accumulate after DNA damage , 30,67�69 and stabilization of TAp73 and TAp63 in response to stress may involve inhibition of ITCH-mediated ubiquitination.65,66 In contrast to the MDM2�p53 core circuit , stress signals apparently do not dissociate the complex between ITCH and p73 directly . Rather , ITCH is downregulated upon stress , through a mechanism still poorly understood.66 A recent paper uncovered the involvement of miRNA-106b in translational repression of ITCH , showing re-activation of p73-dependent apoptosis in primary chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells after miR-106b induction.70 Taken together , these evidences point to ITCH as a major regulator of p73 cellular levels . The p73�ITCH regulatory circuit is modulated by the adaptor protein YAP-1 Yes-associated protein 1 that binds p73 through the same PY motif as Itch and prevents Itch-mediated p73 degradation.71 Accordingly , association with YAP has a crucial role in controlling p73 levels after DNA damage.71 Interestingly , YAP also promotes interaction between p73 and the p300 acetyltransferase , with implica-tions on p73 transcriptional activity.72 As p300-dependent acetylation is also linked with p73 stability , 73 YAP-dependent p73�p300 association could be functional first for p73 stability , and then for p73 transcriptional activity . The adaptor YAP is also a direct target of the PI3K Akt signaling pathway , 74 which has a central role in growth and proliferation in normal cells and in tumors , contributing to cell survival by blocking apoptosis . Notably , this pathway intercepts both p53 and p73 , as Akt-dependent phosphorylation of MDM2 enhances its nuclear accumulation and thus promotes p53 degrada-tion , 75 whereas phosphorylation of YAP interferes with its nuclear import and thus prevents p73 stabilization.74 YAP also binds p63,76 but it is still unknown whether YAP can interfere with ITCH-mediated p63 turnover similarly to what is described for p73 . If this was the case , YAP would qualify as a central modulator of p63 p73 biological activities uncoupled from the p53 response . Interactors Regulating Transcriptional Functions of the p53 Family All p53-family proteins are transcription factors , and the main output of the p53 pathway is the coordinated transcriptional regulation of a wide array of cellular genes . Therefore , a great deal of interest is focused on understanding how different sets of genes are regulated by p53-family proteins in a signal-and context-dependent manner . Promoter selection has an integral part in determining the response to p53 family members , and differences in the sequence and spacing of p53-binding sites , specific PTMs , together with the presence or absence of specific cofactors , all contribute to promoter selection and , in turn , cellular response see Vousden and Prives6 and Menendez et al.8 and references therein . Modulating transactivation . A well-defined mechanism contributing to p53-dependent transactivation is the ability to recruit chromatin remodeling complexes and histone modifiers on target promoters . p300 CBP CREB-binding protein as well as pCAF acetyltransferases bind to p53 and promote transcriptional activity catalyzing acetylation of lysines within the p53 C-terminal region.5 Although p53 modification may be necessary for the recruitment of TAFs transcription-associated factors , the concomitant induction of histone acetylation contributes to the open status of the chromatin . Both p73 and p63 are also bound by p300 CBP , promoting their transcriptional activity , and hence this regulation is highly conserved.77,78 In line with this evidence , phosphorylation-dependent Pin1-mediated prolyl-isomerization stimulates p73 acetylation by p300 CBP , and is required for p73-dependent apoptosis in response to DNA damage.73 The importance of acetylation for p53 function is questioned by the observation that knock-in mice with all C-terminal lysines mutated to arginine have mild phenotypes , suggesting that PTMs of the C-terminal lysines , including acetylation , are not crucial for p53 function in vivo.40 However , this contra-diction might be solved by the recent identification of two additional acetylation sites in the core domain of p53 that affect its transcriptional activity K164 modified by p300 CBP and pCAF and K120 modified by Tip60 .79,80 Moreover , the evidence that deacetylases such as HDAC1 2 and SIRT1 can inhibit p53 and p73 transcriptional activity81�83 keeps alive the debate on the importance of acetylation for p53-family proteins . JMY . Specific cofactors can modulate the interaction between p53 and acetyltransferases . One interesting example is JMY junction-mediating and regulatory protein , a cytoplasmic actin-binding protein that can promote micro-filament polymerization and directly interacts with p53 and p300 CBP.84�87 After DNA damage , JMY accumulates in the nucleus , in which it associates with p53 and the tetratrico-peptide repeat-containing protein STRAP to form a complex that includes p300 CBP , and promotes p53-dependent transcription and apoptosis.84,87 Interestingly , STRAP can also recruit within this complex the arginine methylase PRMT5 that modifies three residues in the C-terminal region of p53.88 Modification of p53 by the JMY-STRAP-PRMT5-p300 CBP complex stimulates transactivation of the p21Waf1 promoter , shifting the p53 response toward cell-cycle arrest rather than apoptosis.88 As all p53-family proteins are regulated by acetyltransferases , it is legitimate to predict the existence of analogous regulatory complexes to control association of p63 and p73 with p300 CBP or other post-translational modulators . Research in this field should be encouraged . PML . Association with regulatory cofactors is also controlled by interaction with scaffolding proteins and accumulation in specific compartments . Perhaps the best example of such regulation is the interaction of p53 , p63 , and p73 with the promyelocytic leukemia protein PML . In fact , all three p53-family proteins can be recruited to subnuclear struc-tures called PML nuclear bodies PML-NB , and association with PML promotes their modification , stabilization , and acti-vation.72,89,90 A number of common interactors of p53-family proteins are also found in PML-NBs , including the acetylase p300 , the protein kinase Hipk2 , and the transcriptional repressor Daxx , and hence PML-dependent recruitment to NBs might regulate formation of specific protein complexes . Notably , PML facilitates the interaction of YAP with p73 see above , stimulates the recruitment of p300 on p73 , and promotes p73-dependent transactivation of pro-apoptotic target genes after DNA damage.72 Therefore , PML may add a further level of modulation to the p73�ITCH�YAP regulatory loop . Intriguingly , both p73 and p53 directly regulate trans-cription of PML , which in turn facilitates their modification and promotes their functions , generating a positive autoregu-latory feedback loop.72,91 Axin . Another example of a scaffolding protein involved in p53 regulation is Axin , a component of the canonical WNT pathway that also binds Daxx and protein kinase Hipk2.92 A recent study uncovered that protein�protein interactions assisted by the Axin scaffold actively contribute to deter-mine the extent of p53 phosphorylation on Ser46 , thus controlling cell fate in response to different levels of DNA damage.93 It should be noted that p73 and p63 also interact with Daxx94,95 as well as with Hipk2,96 and therefore the role of Axin in controlling p53 modification by Hipk2 may extend to the other family members . Determining target gene selection . The mechanism regulating the selective binding of p53-family proteins to different promoters under different conditions is one of the most intriguing open questions in the field . In some cases , the binding of specific interactors with p53 , p63 , or p73 has been shown to influence the choice of target promoters , resulting in the induction of cell-cycle arrest or apoptosis . ASPP proteins . The evolutionarily conserved ASPP family Ankirin repeats , SH3 domain , proline-rich protein regulate the pro-apoptotic , but not cell-cycle functions of all p53 family members . The ASPP1 2 proteins bind p53 and increase transcription of pro-apoptotic genes such as Bax and PIG3.97 Chromatin IP experiments revealed that interaction with ASPP1 2 promotes the selective recruitment of p53 on the promoters of BAX and PIG3 , but not p21WAF or MDM2.98 Similarly , the ASPP1 2 proteins interact with the other p53 family members , p73 and p63 , and also stimulate transacti-vation of pro-apoptotic gene promoters.97 On the other hand , the inhibitory protein iASPP binds p53 and inhibits its ability to upregulate pro-apoptotic genes , without affecting transcription of genes mediating cell-cycle arrest.99 Accordingly , dissociation of p53 from iASPP is facilitated by Pin1-catalyzed prolyl-isomerization after phos-phorylation of Ser46 , and contributes to p53 activation in response to lethal DNA damage.100 Notably , iASPP also binds and inhibits p73 expression of a peptide displacing the iASPP-p73 interaction was shown to promote p73-dependent apoptosis in transformed cells lacking p53.101 Therefore , cellular levels of ASPP proteins , differentially affecting all p53-family proteins , may be a crucial parameter in determining the apoptotic readout of the p53 pathway . Not surprisingly , altered expression of ASPP genes is a frequent event in tumors.102 As ASPP proteins have different binding affinities for distinct p53 family members , 103 the development of competitor peptides potentially displacing iASPP from p53 and or p73 may become a promising strategy to modulate ASPP functions in tumors . Cabin1 . Another interesting example is Cabin1 , a protein that modulates p53 transcriptional activity on selected target gene promoters . Under normal conditions i.e. , in the absence of stress p53 occupies a subset of its target promoters such as Gadd45 , p21Waf1 , Puma , Noxa , and MDM2 . With the exception of the MDM2 promoter , Cabin1 colocalizes with p53 on these sites , recruiting histone deacetylases and methyltransferases to make chromatin unsuitable for transcription . After DNA damage , Cabin1 is rapidly degraded , allowing promoter-bound p53 to induce an immediate transcriptional response.104 Therefore , Cabin1 functions as a rather fast transcriptional switch on selected p53 promoters . As Cabin1 binds the core DBD region of p53 , which is the most conserved among p53-family proteins , it will be interesting to test whether a similar mechanism may also apply to promoters bound and regulated by p73 and p63 . Smads . The choice of what genes are induced or repressed by p53 is also determined by cooperation with other transcription factors that bind discrete responsive elements in target promoters . One example of such regulation is the interaction of p53-family proteins with receptor Smads R-Smads , intracellular transducers of TGF-b signaling.105 p53 binds Smad2 and Smad3 , and cooperates synergis-tically with Smads to regulate transcription of a subset of TGF-b target genes . More specifically , Smad2 3 and p53 bind on two separate adjacent responsive elements in the promoter of the activin-responsive gene Mix.2.105 An alternative architecture has been described in human a-fetoprotein AFP , in which a single Smad p53-responsive element is occupied simultaneously by both proteins in this case , p53 interaction with Smad2 and SnoN represses AFP transcription.106 Importantly , all three p53-family proteins interact physically and functionally with R-Smads , and can cooperate with Smad2 3 to regulate transcription of a Mix.2 reporter construct in response to TGF-b.31,105 Therefore , joint control of target genes by TGF-b and p53-family proteins may be a widespread mechanism . In addition to the well-established transcriptional functions , there are several evidences for transcription-independent tumor suppressive roles of p53 in the cytosol . The key to these functions is regulation of p53 subcellular localization . One of the major mechanisms for p53 cytosolic relocalization is MDM2-mediated monoubiquitination , which does not induce p53 proteasomal degradation but nuclear export.107 The E3 ligases WWP1 and MSL2 are also involved in p53 nuclear export , indicating that ubiquitination is a pivotal mechanism for p53 cytosolic localization.108 Notably , in some instances ubiquitination can have the opposite effect . In fact , the zinc-finger protein E4F1 binds p53 and promotes its ubiquitination on an atypical lysine residue this modification does not induce nuclear export but stimulates p53 recruitment on chromatin and expression of a subset of target genes.109 Another mechanism affecting nucleo-cytoplasmic locali-zation of p53 is interaction with and modification by PARP-1 , a poly-ADP-ribose polymerase activated by DNA damage ADP-ribosylation blocks nuclear export of p53 and increases its transcriptional activities.110 These evidences emphasize that p53 cytosolic localization is a finely regulated phenomenon . Dramatically less is known about cytoplasmic localization of the other p53 family members , although evidences for non-nuclear roles of these proteins are beginning to accumulate see below in this regard , it would be interesting to explore whether monoubiqitination or alternative types of modification are actually conserved in p63 and p73 . The best-characterized non-transcriptional function of p53 is the induction of apoptosis through the mitochondrial pathway . After DNA damage or oncogene activation , mono-ubiquitinated p53 localizes to the mitochondria there , it interacts with a mitochondrial pool of the deubiquitinase HAUSP that removes ubiquitin and allows p53 to form complexes with BCL2 , BCL-xL , BAX , and BAK , thereby promoting apoptosis.7,111 An unexpected role of MDMX MDM4 in p53-mediated mitochondrial apoptosis has also been recently described.112 MDMX can localize to the mitochondria and associate with BCL2 in normal growing cells under cytotoxic stress conditions , MDMX exerts an effect as mitochondrial anchor for p53 phosphorylated on Ser46 , and favors p53�BCL2 interaction to trigger the intrinsic apoptotic pathway.112 Of note , Hipk2 one of the kinases responsible for p53 phopshorylation on Ser46 and MDMX are shared interactors of all p53-family proteins . Moreover , p53 binds BAK , BCL-2 , BAX , and BCL-xL through the DNA-binding domain , which is the region of higher similarity among family members . Therefore , it would not be surprising if p73 and p63 will also prove to be involved in the intrinsic apoptotic pathway . Indeed , it has been recently reported that p73 is cleaved by caspase-3 and caspase-8 in cells undergoing apoptosis after death-receptor activation by TRAIL TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand . Under these conditions , caspase-generated p73 fragments localize to mitochondria and contribute to TRAIL-induced apoptosis.113 Full-length p73 was also detected in mitochondria by biochemical fractionation and electron micro-scopy . Most importantly , addition of recombinant TAp73 to purified mitochondria induced mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization , suggesting that p73 has non-transcriptional pro-apoptotic functions analogous to those of p53.113 Another emerging non-nuclear function of p53 is in regu-lation of autophagy , 114 a process that allows removal of damaged cytoplasmic organelles and adaptation of cells to metabolic stress . Although p53 can transactivate genes that induce autophagy under stress conditions e.g , DRAM , TSC2 , Sestrin1 and 2 , PTEN , and IGFBP3 , depletion or mutation of p53 actually increases autophagy , suggesting that p53 constitutively limits this process in normal growing cells.7,115,116 Even if the mechanism remains unknown , the autophagy-inhibitory activity is ascribable to the cytoplasmic pool of p53 , as degradation of cytosolic p53 by MDM2 promotes autophagy after nutrient depletion , endoplasmic reticulum stress , or treatment with rapamycin.114 Besides Oncogenes Nucleolar stress Differentiation cues p53 MDM2 , additional ubiquitin ligases can mediate cytosolic p53 degradation for example , the already mentioned Synoviolin.58 Interestingly , a recent study revealed that p300 CBP can also function as ubiquitin ligases for cytoplas-mic p53.117 As p300 and CBP can also interact with p73 and p63 , it will be interesting to explore whether their ubiquitin ligase activity may extend to all p53 family members . In any case , the potential role of these cytoplasmic ubiquitin ligases in autophagy remains to be investigated . The evidence of important non-nuclear roles of p53 and perhaps p73 imposes a careful analysis of the cytosolic life of this family of proteins . In fact , a better knowledge of the mechanisms controlling their subcellular localization and their connections with other signaling pathways may offer new opportunities to better define the �p53 system� and improve its pharmacological modulation . p53 pathway has grown significantly , and we should no longer think of p53 as a �lone warrior� in tumor suppression . For this reason , it will be important to develop more reagents and experimental tools to study all p53-family proteins , and their isoforms , at a greater level of resolution . Such knowledge will allow a more efficient use of currently available drugs , and will increase the number of regulatory interactions that may become potential targets for new therapeutic molecules . The p53 Pathway as a Network This overview of some regulatory interactions of the p53 family highlights the concept that multifaceted aspects of this pathway are dependent on a wide repertoire of protein� protein interactions that , although often shared among the family members , can have similar or different effects on each p53-family protein . Considering the complex network of protein interactions modulating all p53-family proteins , the whole family should be considered when analyzing the genetics of cancer cells Figure 3 . Fluctuations in the levels of selected p53 family members or their isoforms might change the relative availability of shared protein partners , as multiple p53-family proteins compete for interaction . Also , differential expression of selected interactors � linked with genetic variation , for example � may distinguish the response of the p53 pathway to the same potentially oncogenic stimuli in diverse individuals . In tumor cells , loss of p53 abrogates one very crucial node of this network , but p73 and p63 may compensate to some extent . In contrast , mutation of p53 mut-p53 generates a dominant protein , often very stable , that can still form complexes with a subset of p53 partners , and may also acquire novel interactors . High levels of mut-p53 may be sufficient to bind and inhibit p73 and p63 , as well as to titrate common interacting proteins , thus making the network extremely weak . For this reason , displacing mut-p53 interactions may become a promising approach to combat the more aggressive features of tumors bearing p53 mutations.118,119 Finally , functional loss or deregulated expression of some crucial p53 interactors are frequent in primary cancers and transformed cell lines bearing wild-type p53 e.g. , p14ARF , MDM2 , Chk2 , iASPP etc. these alterations may have a greater impact if they affect regulators that are common to all p53-family proteins e.g. , MDM2 or ASPP proteins , with relevant implications for cancer prognosis and , eventually , therapy . In our opinion , these premises are sufficient to promote the systematic study of the protein interaction profile of the entire p53 family . p53 has recently turned �thirty� . During these years , a p53-centric approach to the pathway has yielded some very promising therapeutic tools , including small molecules that target the MDM2�p53 interaction e.g. , Nutlin120 and RITA121 . However , our awareness of the complexity of the The authors declare no conflict of interest . Acknowledgements .

Figure 1 Structure of p53-family proteins and their principal isoforms , together with some regulatory post-translational modifications . p53 family proteins have a similar structure , comprising an N-terminal transactivation domain TA , followed by a proline-rich region PR , a central DNA-binding domain DBD , and a C-terminal oligomerization domain OD . In p63 and p73 there is an additional C-terminal sterile-a motif SAM . Family members have limited overall homology , but strong similarity in the DBD approximately 60 % between p53 and p63 p73 and approximately 85 % between p63 and p73 .10,138 All p53-family proteins produce two groups of mRNAs controlled by separate promoters P1 and P2 , encoding proteins with alternative N-terminal regions . Those generated from P1 promoters contain the complete TA domain and are transcriptionally proficient those generated from P2 promoters lack the TA and are transcriptionally inactive DN isoforms . For both p53 and p73 , additional N-terminal variants are generated by alternative splicing or internal initiation of translation.138 DN isoforms can still bind to DNA , and can exert an effect as dominant-negative versions.138 However , this general assumption requires some caution since for instance , DNp63 isoforms are transcriptionally proficient.139,140 All p53-family transcripts are also subject to alternative splicing at the C-terminus , independent of the promoter used , thus generating a combinatorial variety of isoforms obtainable adjoining each N-terminal variant with any of the C-terminal variants . The longest C-terminal variant is dubbed a in p63 and p73 , and comprises the SAM domain . In p53 , the longest C-terminal isoform corresponds to the �classic� p53 transcript , and is simply indicated as �p53� . Alternative splicing of C-terminal exons generates shorter isoforms , named b and g . Additional C-terminal splice variants in p73138 are not reported in this study . The p53-family proteins also share some common post-translational modifications , reported schematically in the drawings in their respective positions a question mark indicates that , although the modification has been shown , the target residue is unknown . It is evident that many modifications are specific for selected isoforms Figure 2 Protein�protein interactions of the p53 family . a The figure summarizes some interactors of the p53-family proteins , arranged according to their region of binding .

Data were retrieved using the APID web interface http bioinfow.dep.usal.es apid index.htm and manually amended according to the most recent literature Figure 3 The p53 family as a network . The p53-family pathway is activated by a wide array of signals , including potentially oncogenic stresses , as well as physiological cues . Once activated , the pathway induces diverse cellular outcomes , ranging from cell-cycle arrest , to senescence , to programmed cell death apoptosis . A web of upstream regulators control covalent modifications , protein levels , and cellular localization of p53-family proteins , and can either activate or inhibit the pathway in response to specific signals . Downstream , protein cofactors modulate promoter selection and transcriptional functions of p53-family proteins , fine-tuning the cellular response to any given signal . In addition , protein interactors can behave as direct effectors of non-transcriptional functions of p53-family proteins , for instance , in mitochondrial apoptosis . Some protein modulators are specific for each p53-related protein , whereas others are shared among the p53 family . Moreover , common interactors may have similar or different effects on each p53-family protein . As a result , the cellular outcomes to any given conditions are influenced by the expression levels of each p53 family member , as well as by the pattern of modulators that are expressed in a given cell or tissue , and their respective expression levels 
20379197	www.nature.com cdd Growth factor-stimulated receptor tyrosine kinases RTKs typically activate the phosphoinositide 3-kinase PI3K Akt pathway by recruiting inactive PI3K from the cytoplasm to phosphotyrosines in the receptor itself or in receptor-associated adaptor proteins.1,2 Here , PI3K has improved access to its plasma membrane-located substrates and in particular converts phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate to phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate PIP3 . The latter in turn serves as a binding site for pleckstrin homology domain containing proteins , especially the serine-threonine kinase Akt PKB and the phosphoinosite-dependent protein kinase-1 PDK1 . On activation by PDK1 , Akt phosphorylates proteins involved in the regulation of proliferation , cell growth , survival , and motility , for example forkhead transcription factors , mammalian target of rapamycin , BAD , and glycogen synthase kinase-3b GSK3b .1,2 The major negative regulator of the PI3K pathway is the tumor suppressor phosphatase and tensin homolog PTEN , a lipid phosphatase that dephos-phorylates PIP3 and thus terminates Akt activity.1,2 In correspondence to its crucial function in cell growth and proliferation , the PI3K Akt PTEN system is deregulated in a broad range of cancer entities , and mutations in its major components PI3K , PTEN , and Akt are frequently found in tumor cells . The PIP3-generating PI3Ks , which are relevant in RTK signaling , are grouped together in the IA subclass of the PI3K family and are heterodimers composed of one of the five regulatory subunits p85a , p85b , p55a , p55g , and p50a and one of the three catalytic subunits p110a , p110b , and p110g .1,2 In recent years , it turned out that the PI3KCA gene , which encodes the p110a catalytic subunit , is one of the most often mutated oncogenes in human malignancies . Somatic missense mutations in the PI3KCA gene have been found in liver , breast , colorectal , brain , and gastric cancer with frequencies of up to 40 % .3 The mutations in the PI3KCA gene are mainly located in two hotspots encoding the helical and kinase domains of the protein and are in accordance with the concept that these alterations stimulate the lipid kinase activity of the molecule.3 In fact , it has been shown in isogenic pairs of HCT116 and DLD1 cells that harbor either the PI3KCA wild-type allele or the hotspot mutations H1047R and E545K that these genetic alterations result in improved growth factor-independent proliferation , apoptosis resistance , and tumor cell invasion.4 Tumor necrosis factor TNF -related apoptosis-inducing ligand TRAIL receptor-1 TRAILR1 , TRAILR2 , and CD95 are prototypic representatives of the death receptor subgroup of the TNF receptor superfamily that trigger the extrinsic path-way of apoptosis in a variety of cell types and tumor cells.5 The TRAIL death receptors and CD95 are ubiquitously expressed and their activation is mainly controlled by the strictly regu-lated expression of their corresponding death ligands TRAIL and CD95L . Both ligands are expressed by activated immune cells and are used to induce cell death in corresponding target cells , such as virus-infected or transformed cells.6�8 In view of the observation that late stages of some cancers , for example colorectal cancer , display constitutive expression of CD95L , which correlates with poor prognosis and enhanced meta-stasis , 9,10 it has been suggested that death receptor-resistant tumor cells hijack the initially anti-tumoral-acting death ligands to evade the immune system by inducing cell death in tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes.11 Additional and or alternative pro-tumoral functions of tumor-associated CD95L expression might base on the stimulation of proinflammatory path-ways.12,13 In fact , a metastasis and invasion-promoting function has been shown in vivo for TRAIL in a model of xenotransplanted Bcl-xL-protected pancreatic ductal adeno-carcinoma cells and for CD95L in a syngeneic model of intracranial glioblastoma multiforme.14,15 Here , we show that mutated PI3K catalytic subunit a PIK3CA switches the quality of death receptor signaling from apoptosis induction to inflammation and invasion in colorectal HCT116 cancer cells . Particularly , we show that PIK3CA expression confers apoptosis protection downstream of death receptor-signaling complex formation and thus allows proces-sing and activation of the complete cellular caspase-8 pool . Although caspase-8 activity is dispensable for death receptor-induced nuclear factor kappaB NFkB signaling , it is required to activate rho-associated , coiled-coil containing protein kinase 1 ROCK-1 , thereby inducing the remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton . Results Mutated PIK3CA blocks death receptor-induced apop-tosis downstream of caspase-8 activation in HCT116 cells . Using gene targeting of PIK3CA in human HCT116 cancer cells , it has been shown that the exclusive expression of a single mutated PIK3CA allele harboring the activating H1047R substitution in exon 20 is sufficient to confer strong protection against TRAIL-induced apoptosis.4 In contrast , the corresponding isogenic cell line having an intact single wild-type PIK3CA allele showed almost complete cell death in response to TRAIL with an ED50-value of B10 ng ml Figure 1a . Using Fc-CD95L , a hexameric highly active variant of CD95L , we obtained similar results . HCT116 cells expressing mutated PIK3CA showed practically no apoptotic response toward Fc-CD95L , whereas the PIK3CA wild-type-expressing counterparts were readily killed at low concentrations in a caspase-dependent manner Figure 1a and c . There were no significant differences in the cell surface expression of TRAILR1 , TRAILR2 , and CD95 bet-ween HCT116-PIK3CA-wt and HCT116-PIK3CA-mut cells Figure 1d . As shown in the original description of the HCT116-PIK3CA-wt and HCT116-PIK3CA-mut cells , 4 there was no or barley detectable Akt phosphorylation in the PIK3CA-wt harboring cells , whereas the HCT116-PIK3CA-mut cells displayed constitutive Akt phosphorylation Figure 1e . In accordance with a recent study of Kleber et al.15 demonstrating CD95-induced activation of the PI3K Akt pathway in apoptosis-resistant glioblastoma cells , we observed that stimulation with Fc-CD95L and TRAIL further increased Akt phosphorylation in HCT116-PIK3CA-mut cells Figure 1e . Earlier reports showed that activation of the PI3K Akt pathway can interfere with CD95L-and TRAIL-induced apoptosis by upregulation of cellular FLICE-like inhibitory proteins cFLIP .16,17 In case of CD95 , the protec-tive effect of PI3K Akt signaling has additionally traced back to modulation of the lateral mobility of CD95 in the plasma membrane.18 We , therefore , next analyzed CD95-signaling complex formation and CD95 lipid raft localization in response to Fc-CD95L . In sucrose-density centrifugation , HCT116-PIK3CA-mut cells revealed a higher basal asso-ciation of CD95 with the low-density lipid raft-containing fraction compared with HCT116-PIK3CA-wt cells . In both cell lines , this association was further increased in a caspase-dependent manner on stimulation with Fc-CD95L Figure 2a . The minor PIK3CA-mut-related difference in CD95 lipid raft association was obviously of no great rele-vance for ligand-induced CD95-signal complex formation , as immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated comparably efficient formation of SDS-stable high-molecular weight CD95 aggregates and also similar recruitment and proces-sing of FADD , caspase-8 , and cFLIP-L Figure 2b . Most indicative for the unaltered caspase-8-activating capacity of CD95 and the TRAIL death receptors in the presence of PIK3CA-mut , however , was the observation that cell lysates of HCT116-PIK3CA-mut and HCT116-PIK3CA-wt cells showed no significant differences in processing of procaspase-8 to mature caspase-8 and roughly similar processing of the caspase-8 substrates FLIP-L Figure 2b and pro-caspase-3 Figure 2c . Notably , there was an important functional differ-ence in caspase-3 processing between HCT116-PIK3CA-wt and HCT116-PIK3CA-mut cells . Although there was complete processing toward the active p17 subunit of mature caspase-3 in HCT116-PIK3CA-wt cells stimulated with TRAIL or Fc-CD95L , the p19 intermediate of caspase-3 processing accumulated in HCT116-PIK3CA-mut cells Figure 2c . Interestingly , the p19 , but not the p17 subunit of caspase-3 , is subject to negative regulation by IAP proteins.19 Accumu-lation of fully mature p17 p12 heterotetrameric caspase-3 might , therefore , be dependent on the release of pro-apoptotic mitochondrial factors , for example SMAC , that antagonize caspase inhibition by IAP proteins.20 In accordance with the idea that HCT116-PIK3CA-mut and HCT116-PIK3CA-wt cells differ in the �apoptotic� activation of the mitochondria in res-ponse to death receptor activation , processing of caspase-9 , caspase-2 , and PARP was evident in the PIK3CA-wt-expressing cells , whereas there was only a very minor effect in this respect in the PIK3CA-mut-expressing cells Figure 2c . Taken together , our data suggest that PIK3CA-mut blocks TRAIL-and CD95L-induced apoptosis downstream of death receptor-associated-signaling complex formation , but up-stream of the release of pro-apoptotic mitochondrial factors . Indeed , a recent publication showed that expression of Bax was severely reduced in HCT116-PIK3CA-mut cells.21 We , therefore , investigated next whether the loss of Bax expres-sion is sufficient to protect HCT116 cells from TRAIL-and CD95L-induced apoptosis . Although HCT116 cells harboring a wild type and a mutated PIK3CA allele were not as TRAIL CD95L sensitive as HCT116-PIK3CA-wt cells , they never-theless showed higher sensitivity than the almost completely protected HCT116-PIK3CA-mut cells data not shown . A Bax-deficient isogenic variant derived from HCT116 cells , 22 however , was almost fully rescued from death receptor-mediated apoptosis and showed a similar block of effector caspase activation downstream of death receptor-signaling-complex formation , as observed before in the HCT116-PIK3CA-mut cells Supplementary Figure 1a and b . 25 TRAIL and CD95L elicit a proinflammatory response in PIK3CA-mut-protected HCT116 cells . TRAIL and Fc-CD95L both induced activation of the classical NFkB path-way in HCT116-PIK3CA-mut cells evident from a significant increase in inhibitor of kappaB a IkBa phosphorylation after cell lysate TRAIL ZVAD ZVAD uPa ng 1.0 1 and 4 h post-stimulation Figure 3a . In contrast , in HCT116-PIK3CA-wt cells , IkBa phosphorylation was poor or absent . The impaired NFkB response in TRAIL Fc-CD95L-stimulated HCT116-PIK3CA-wt cells , however , did not reflect a fundamental difference in CD95-and TRAIL death receptor signaling between PIK3CA-wt and PIK3CA-mut-expressing cells for the following reason caspase-8 and especially effector caspases activated in course of apoptosis shut down the classical NFkB pathway by cleavage of various NFkB-signaling intermediates.12 Accordingly , after blocking caspase activation with z-VAD-fmk in HCT116-PIK3CA-wt cells , TRAIL and Fc-CD95L induced an NFkB response as good or even better as in PIK3CA-mut-protected HCT116 cells , whereas z-VAD-fmk treatment alone had no major effect on the NFkB response Figure 3a . Although there seemed to be quantitative differences in the extent of IkBa phosphorylation between ZVAD-protected HCT116-PIK3CA-wt and HCT116-PIK3CA-mut cells Figure 3a , genome-wide mRNA analysis suggested that the consti-tutive activation of the PI3K Akt pathway in the HCT116-PIK3CA-mut cells did not affect the upregulation of NFkB-regulated genes Supplementary Table I . The majority of NFkB targets was similarly induced by TRAIL and Fc-CD95L and likewise upregulated in Bax-deficient HCT116 cells and parental HCT116 cells treated with z-VAD-fmk Supplementary Table I . In accordance with the crucial function of NFkB signaling in remodeling of the extra - cellular matrix and metastasis , we found increased activity of TRAIL-and Fc-CD95L-stimulated HCT116-PIK3CA-mut cells in an in vitro invasion assay and enhanced uPA production Figure 3b and c . TRAIL stimulation also enhanced invasiveness of the Bax-deficient HCT116 cells Supplementary Figure 2 . TRAIL-and CD95L-stimulated HCT116-PIK3CA-mut cells adopt an amoeba-like morphology . HCT116-PIK3CA-mut cells treated with TRAIL or Fc-CD95L rounded up and adopted a morphology resembling swollen cells undergoing necrosis Figure 4a�d . The latter could be ruled out as the cells retained high viability Figure 1a . Moreover , the change in morphology was reversible and disappeared within a couple of hours after removal of the initiating death ligand data not shown or with prolonged incubation 448 h , Figure 4b . Moreover , HCT116-PIK3CA-wt cells showed complete breakdown of the actin cytoskeleton in response to Fc-CD95L , whereas HCT116-PIK3CA-mut cells retained an intact actin cytoskeleton supporting the rounded cell morpho-logy Figure 4e . Pretreatment with z-VAD-fmk completely prevented the TRAIL-and Fc-CD95L-induced changes in cellular morphology Figure 5a�c . This observation pointed to a possible involvement of caspase-8 in the TRAIL-Fc-CD95L-induced alterations in cellular morphology , as this is the only caspase in HCT116-PIK3CA-mut cells that can be fully activated . Indeed , caspase-8 knockdown reduced the fraction of rounded cells in response to TRAIL and Fc-CD95L Figure 5d . Thus , this response of HCT116-PIK3CA-mut cells was obviously dependent on caspase-8 and its enzymatic activity . Others and we have shown that CD95-induced activation of NFkB signaling requires caspase-8 independent from its enzymatic activity.23,24 We thus also analyzed the effect of caspase-8 knockdown on Fc-CD95L-and TRAIL-induced NFkB activation in HCT116-PIK3CA-mut cells . In good accordance with our earlier studies , caspase-8 knockdown was accompanied by a strong reduction of Fc-CD95L-TRAIL-induced upregulation of the NFkB-regulated cytokine IL8 Figure 5e . However , as already shown in Figure 3a , inhibition of caspase-8 activity with z-VAD-fmk had no inhibitory effect . Therefore , both acti-vation of the NFkB pathway and induction of changes in cellular morphology by Fc-CD95L and TRAIL require the presence of caspase-8 , but only the latter depends additionally on the enzymatic activity of the molecule . TRAIL-and CD95L-induced changes in cellular morphology depend on caspase-8-mediated activation of ROCK-1 . The type of TRAIL-and Fc-CD95L-induced morphological changes in HCT116-PIK3CA-mut cells points to an involvement of the actin cytoskeleton . ROCK-1 has a central function in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton and is a prominent caspase-3 substrate that is cleaved and activated during apoptosis.25,26 Activation of ROCK-1 is crucial for apoptosis-accompanied membrane blebbing , a classical hallmark of the apoptotic execution phase.25,26 As the shown caspase-3 cleavage site of ROCK-1 DETD1113 matches also reasonable well with prototypical caspase-8 recognition sites Figure 6a , we evaluated next the possible involvement of ROCK-1 in the cell death-independent changes in cell morphology induced by TRAIL and Fc-CD95L . ROCK-1 was cleaved with comparable efficacy in HCT116-PIK3CA-wt cells undergoing apoptosis and apop-tosis-resistant HCT116-PIK3CA-mut cells Figure 6b , suggesting that ROCK-1 cleavage is independent from active effector caspases and apoptosis . Moreover , a selective caspase-3 inhibitor DQMD-fmk partially rescued HCT116-PIK3CA-wt cells from TRAIL-and Fc-CD95L-induced apoptosis , but showed no major effect on ROCK-1 cleavage and reorganization of cellular shape in HCT116-PIK3CA-mut cells Figure 6c�e . Notably , when the sensitive + ZVAD Fc - ounded c 50 HCT116-PIK3CA-wt cells were rescued from TRAIL FasL-induced apoptosis with DQMD-fmk , these cells also adopt an amoeboid shape data not shown . In further accordance with a function of activating ROCK-1 cleavage in TRAIL-Fc-CD95L-induced amoeboid morphology , the fraction of HCT116-PIK3CA-mut cells with rounded shape was signi-ficantly reduced on pretreatment with the ROCK-1 inhibitor Y27632 or ROCK-1 knockdown Figure 7a and b . TRAIL-and Fc-CD95L-induced NFkB signaling , however , was independent from ROCK-1 data not shown . Notably , pharmacological ROCK-1 inhibition almost completely inhibited the TRAIL-and Fc-CD95L-induced invasive activity of HCT116-PIK3CA-mut cells Figure 7c . Pretreatment with Y27632 neither exerted a significant effect on apoptosis sensitivity of HCT116-PIK3CA-wt cells Supplementary Figure 3a and b nor it sensitized HCT116-PIK3CA-mut cells for death receptor-induced apop-tosis Supplementary Figure 3b . Thus , ROCK-1 is involved in a subset of non-apoptotic death receptor-induced cellular effects , but is dispensable for apoptosis induction . cFLIP-S inhibits induction of amoeboid cellular morphology by TRAIL and CD95L . In agreement with our aforementioned observation that caspase-8 activity is required for TRAIL-Fc-CD95L-induced alterations in cellular morphology , we further found that ectopic expression of cFLIP-S not only prevented death receptor-associated caspase-8 maturation , but also death receptor-induced remodeling of the cytoskeleton in non-apoptotic HCT116-PIK3CA-mut cells Figure 8a and b . FLIP proteins also inter-fere with NFkB activation by TRAIL and Fc-CD95L.23,24,27,28 Consistent with this , we noticed that cFLIP-S expression abrogated TRAIL-and Fc-CD95L-induced upregulation of the NFkB-regulated target IL8 in HCT116-PIK3CA-mut cells Figure 8c . As cFLIP proteins can contribute to tumor cell escape from apoptosis induction by death receptors , these proteins are commonly regarded as tumor-promoting factors . In contrast , our cFLIP-related data now suggest that cFLIP proteins can also exert anti-tumoral effects in death receptor-resistant tumor cells . Discussion In this study , we analyzed the cooperation of the prominent oncogenic PI3K Akt-signaling pathway with CD95 and the TRAIL death receptors . Analysis of isogenic HCT116 cell lines expressing wild-type or mutant PIK3CA revealed enhanced growth factor-independent cell proliferation and resistance against apoptosis induction by TRAIL and growth factor deprivation in the mutant PIK3CA cells.4,21 In accordance with the study of Guo et al. , 21 which traced back apoptosis resistance of growth factor-deprived HCT116-PIK3CA-mut cells to downregulation of Bax expression , we found no major differences in the recruitment and activation of caspase-8 by CD95 and TRAIL death receptor between wild-type and mutant PIK3CA-expressing isogenic HCT116 cells Figures 1 and 2 . Thus , resistance against death receptor-induced apoptosis in the HCT116-PIK3CA-mut model is largely dependent on mechanisms acting down-stream of death receptor-associated caspase-8 maturation . In other cellular systems , PI3K Akt pathway-dependent death receptor resistance has been assigned to changes in receptor mobility in the plasma membrane or upregulation of the caspase-8 inhibitory cFLIP proteins.16�18 Our data thus suggest that the PTEN-PI3K-Akt system can confer protection against death receptor apoptosis by independently acting mechanisms in a cell type-specific manner . The plasticity in anti-apoptotic PI3K-Akt signaling might become especially important in view of the fact that distinct apoptosis inhibitory mechanisms differentially affect non-apoptotic signaling by CD95 and the TRAIL death receptors . Indeed , we observed that expression of cFLIP-S , which is a prominent and strong inhibitor of CD95-and TRAIL-induced apoptosis , also blocks TRAIL-and Fc-CD95L-stimulated NFkB activation in apopto-sis-resistant cells expressing mutated PIK3CA Figure 8 . Thus , dependent on how the PTEN-PI3K-Akt system medi-ates death receptor resistance , it not only supports tumor cell survival by preventing TRAIL-and Fc-CD95L-induced apop-tosis , but in addition enables cancer cells to hijack these molecules to establish a tumor-promoting microenvironment . An involvement of CD95 in driving invasion and metastasis of cancer cells has recently been shown for glioblastoma cells.15 In this study , activation of CD95 resulted in recruitment and activation of Src family kinases and the p85 subunit of PI3K accompanied by a subsequent increase in invasiveness because of stimulation of the Akt-GSK3b-b-catenin axis and upregulation of matrix metalloproteinases.15 Remarkably , CD95-induced PI3K activation and cell migration in glio-blastoma cells occur in a manner that is neither blocked by the general caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk nor accompanied by increased recruitment of FADD and caspase-8 to CD95 . There is evidence that caspase-8 also has a function in death receptor-independent modes of cell migration and cell motility . So , in NB7 neuroblastoma cells with hyperactive Src or stimulated with EGF , caspase-8 becomes phosphorylated on Y380 enabling the protein to bind the p85 subunit of PI3K and to activate the PI3K effector Rac , which is of pivotal relevance for cell migration.29,30 In this model of cell migration , the enzymatic activity of caspase-8 is again dispensable.29,30 In the same cellular model , a non-catalytic function of caspase-8 in Src-dependent cell adhesion and activation of extracellular-regulated kinase 1 2 has also been shown , but the relation of these events to p85 Rac-mediated cell migration is still unclear.31 In addition , caspase-8 has also been found to be recruited to the focal adhesion complex in NB7 cells in which it enhances cell migration by stimulating ROCK1siRNA con . siRNA cells 75 - talin cleavage by calpains in a caspase-activity apoptosis-independent manner.32,33 As Src and PI3K are part of the focal adhesion complex , it is tempting to speculate that Y380 phosphorylation of caspase-8 and activation of PI3K Rac reflect a function of caspase-8 in the focal adhesion complex . Taken together , to date , there is no evidence that the migration-promoting functions of CD95 and or caspase-8 require caspase-8 activity . Now , we observed that TRAIL and Fc-CD95L induce transition to an amoeboid-like cell shape that has been associated in recent years with a specialized type of cell migration that differs from the classical �mesenchymal� type of cell migration regarded above . Although the mesenchymal type of cell migration requires pericellular proteolysis and Rac-mediated reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton , the amoeboid type of cell invasion is independent from pericellular 100 lls % 75 100 K1siRNA ROCK1siRNA 75 NA cells con . siR -ROC - - proteolysis and has crucial requirement for ROCK-1 signal-ing.34,35 Noteworthy , the TRAIL-Fc-CD95L-induced transi-tion to an amoeboid cell morphology described in our study is not only dependent on caspase-8 and its enzymatic activity , but also involves ROCK activity Figures 5a�c , 7a , and b . Moreover , it has been earlier shown that in course of apop-tosis , caspase-3-mediated cleavage of ROCK-1 releases an active fragment that induces apoptotic membrane bleb-bing.25,26 In good accordance with the idea that CD95 and the TRAIL death receptors trigger amoeboid transition by caspase-8-mediated , caspase-3-independent cleavage of ROCK-1 in non-apoptotic cells by a related mechanism , we showed that ROCK-1 cleavage and amoeboid transition are not significantly affected by caspase-3 inhibition and or expression of PIK3CA-mut Figure 6b , d , and e . Notably , the inhibitory effect of caspase-8 knockdown on the death % rounded 50 receptor-induced morphological change in cellular shape was more pronounced compared with the effect of ROCK-1 knockdown Figures 5d and 7b . This might be due to the existence of additional caspase-8 substrates affecting the cellular shape . In fact , caspase-8 also cleaves plectin , which links the actin cytoskeleton to microtubules and intermediate filaments.36 Fc-CD95L also induced an amoeboid morphology in apoptosis-resistant HCT116-Bax cells . However , in these cells , the effect was less pronounced than in the HCT116-PIK3CA-mut cells Supplementary Figure 4 Figure 4 . Parental HCT116 cells , which harbor a PIK3CA-wt and a PIK3CA-mut allele , are almost as sensitive for apop-tosis induction as HCT116-PIK3CA-wt cells Supplementary Figure 1a Figure 1 . Thus , in a situation of mixed PIK3CA-mut and PIK3CA-wt alleles , the latter wt seems to dominate the cellular effects . The finding of a reduced Fc-CD95L-induced adoption of amoeboid shape in the HCT116-Bax cells compared with the equally resistant HCT116-PIK3CA-mut cells might , therefore , mean that not only caspase-8-mediated ROCK-1 cleavage is involved in triggering the adaptation of amoeboid shape , but also other PI3K Akt pathway-dependent mechanisms . In fact , IGF-1 , which activates the PI3K Akt FLIPS caspase-8 fl p53 55 ? actin 1.5 1 0 pathway , also increased the number of HCT116-Bax cells with amoeboid shape Btwofold Supplementary Figure 4 . We also analyzed whether HCT116-PIK3CA-mut cells undergo transition of a spindle shaped to amoeboid migration in a 3D collagen lattice in response to TRAIL or Fc-CD95L . However , the HCT116-PIK3CA-mut cells proved to be not well suited to this assay . First , the HCT116-PIK3CA-mut cells needed around 2 days to readopt their flat shape in the 3D collagen lattice , and second , showed poor migration and no significant alterations in cellular morphology irrespec-tive of TRAIL treatment data not shown . Therefore , further investigations are under way to answer the question whether death ligand-induced adoption of an amoboid cellular shape is sufficient for the amoboid-like type of migration .

20395960	www.nature.com cdd Death receptors , such as Fas CD95 and the TRAIL receptors , activate the extrinsic apoptotic pathway . This involves assembly of the death-inducing signaling complex DISC at their cytoplasmic tail , which results in Caspase-8 and or -10 activation.1 These inducer caspases subsequently cleave and activate effector caspases and the BH3 domain-only Bcl-2 family member Bid.2 The effector caspases can in principle directly dismantle the cell to generate apoptotic bodies . Bid , however , connects death receptors to the intrinsic pathway for effector caspase activation . Upon Bid cleavage , its carboxy-terminal fragment translocates to the mitochondria , where it triggers mitochondrial outer membrane permeability MOMP through the Bcl-2 family members Bak and Bax.2,3 This releases apoptogenic factors , including Cytochrome c , Smac DIABLO and HtrA2 Omi into the cytosol . There , Cytochrome c binds to Apaf-1 , creating the apoptosome , which is a platform for recruitment and activation of Caspase-9 . This inducer caspase in turn cleaves and activates effector caspases.3 Given these scenarios , the mitochondrial pathway is generally viewed as a signal amplifier for effector caspase activation after death receptor stimulation . Moreover , different cell types proved more or less reliant on the mitochondrial pathway for effector caspase activation . In so-called Type I cells , inhibition of MOMP by Bcl-2 overexpression did not block death receptor-induced apoptosis , whereas it did so in Type II cells.4 This distinction was valid for long-term established tumor cell lines in vitro , but also for primary cells in vivo . Specifically , hepatocytes are classified as Type II cells , 5 whereas thymocytes and peripheral T cells are classified as Type I cells.6�9 The efficiency of Caspase-8 10 activation in response to death receptor stimulation is greater in Type I cells than in Type II cells.4 Therefore , it is generally assumed that Type I cells do not require the mitochondrial amplification loop for effector caspase activation , whereas Type II cells do.10 Among solid tumor cell lines , Type I and Type II cells have distinctions , which are connected to the mode of death receptor signaling Type I cells express mesenchymal-like genes , whereas Type II cells express epithelium-like markers.11 In Type I cells , but not in Type II cells , Fas CD95 receptors aggregate on ligand binding and efficiently form a DISC with the aid of filamentous actin.10 These earlier studies focused on the strength of the Caspase-8 10 signal in Type I versus Type II cells and essentially viewed the mitochondria as signal amplifier for effector caspase cleavage , by engaging Caspase-9 . Recent studies , however , have highlighted another control point in apoptotic execution by death receptors , which is that imposed by XIAP.8,12 The XIAP protein is an inhibitor of apoptosis protein IAP that controls the catalytic activities of Caspase-9 , Caspase-3 and Caspase-7 after their initial activation . It uses a baculovirus inhibitor repeat BIR domain to bind to an IAP-binding motif IBM in the small subunit of these caspases , which is exposed on their proteolytic cleavage . In addition , XIAP shields the substrate-binding site of the effector caspases with a peptide strand preceding the BIR domain.13 Upon their release from the mitochondria , Smac DIABLO and HtrA2 Omi bind to XIAP through their own IBM , and thereby free the caspases from inhibition.14�17 The caspases can subsequently process themselves into fully active , non-XIAP inhibitable fragments and propagate the apoptotic signal.18 By XIAP neutralization , mitochondria make a unique contribution to effector caspase activation , which is not offered by the extrinsic pathway . In Type II cells , the mitochondrial pathway makes two potential contributions to effector caspase activation down-stream from death receptors Caspase-9 activation for initial effector caspase cleavage and XIAP elimination for full effector caspase activity.19 It was recently shown that loss of XIAP rendered hepatocytes independent of Bid for apoptosis induction , that is , allowed for an apparent switch from Type II to Type I signaling.8 This suggests that in Type II cells , death receptors need the mitochondrial pathway for XIAP neutralization rather than for Caspase-9 activity . In Type I cells , Caspase-8 activity also leads to Bid cleavage , MOMP and the consequent release of Smac DIABLO and HtrA2 Omi , but this is reportedly not essential for the apoptotic response . We surmised that in Type I cells these factors have a role in death receptor-induced apoptosis that had previously been overlooked . Therefore , we examined the impact of the mitochondrial pathway on clonogenic death of Type I tumor cells . We observed that blockade of the mitochondrial pathway by Bid RNA interference RNAi or Bcl-2 overexpression mediated significant clonogenic resis-tance to death receptor ligand TRAIL . Upon close examina-tion , the mitochondrial pathway did seem to contribute to effector caspase activation . Smac DIABLO function , but not Caspase-9 activity , was decisive for full effector caspase activation and clonogenic execution of Type I cells . Down-regulation of XIAP by RNAi significantly reduced clonogenicity of TRAIL-treated Type I cells , indicating that the inhibition of XIAP activity is an important function of Smac DIABLO . We conclude that the mitochondrial pathway limits clonogenicity of Type I cells after death receptor stimulation by enabling full effector caspase activation , not with the aid of the apopto-some , but by virtue of IAP antagonism . Results Identification of Bid as a regulator of clonogenic death in Type I tumor cells . We performed an RNAi screen in MCF-7 breast carcinoma cells to identify new regulators of TRAIL-induced apoptosis . The MCF-7 cells were chosen because they proved an excellent model system for studying cell biological aspects of death receptor signaling.20 These cells lack Caspase-3 , but behave as Type I cells when Caspase-3 has been reconstituted.4 Upon stable reconstitution of Caspase-3 , only 1 in 5000 MCF-7Casp-3 cells proved spontaneously resistant to isoleucine zippered IZ TRAIL21 in a clonogenic assay data not shown . The screening approach was validated by the selection of a Caspase-8-targeting shRNA from the retroviral library of about 24 000 shRNAs directed at 8000 genes.22 In addition , a Bid-targeting shRNA emerged from the screen . As the mitochondrial pathway is thought to be redundant for death receptor-induced apoptosis in Type I cells , this was unexpected . Therefore , we decided to look further into the contribution of the mitochondrial pathway to TRAIL-induced apoptosis in MCF-7Casp-3 cells . A stable Bid RNAi MCF-7Casp-3 cell line was made with the Bid-targeting shRNA Bid shRNA1 identified in the RNAi screen . In addition , a stable Caspase-8 RNAi version of this cell line was made . The same batch of MCF-7Casp-3 cells was transduced in parallel with empty vector EV , shRNA for Caspase-8 , or shRNA for Bid to exclude background effects . High efficiency of retroviral transduction furthermore excluded clonal selection of transduced cells . Both Bid and Caspase-8 expression were efficiently silenced by their targeting shRNAs Figure 1a , b . To examine the Type I nature of MCF-7Casp-3 cells , we monitored TRAIL receptor-induced Caspase-3 cleavage in control and Bid RNAi versions of this cell line . Cells were stimulated with 25 , 50 or 100 ng ml IZ-TRAIL for 3 h and Caspase-3 cleavage was monitored by flow cytometry using an antibody that recognizes all cleaved forms of Caspase-3 , but not the proform . This analysis validated the effect of the shRNA for Caspase-8 , as cleavage of its substrate Caspase-3 was significantly impaired at all IZ-TRAIL doses Figure 1c . In case of Bid RNAi , Caspase-3 cleavage was not significantly altered Figure 1c . Further-more , apoptotic cell death , as read out after 16 h by membrane permeability and phosphatidyl serine PS exposure , was not evidently affected by Bid RNAi Figure 1d . These data confirm that MCF-7 cells reconsti-tuted with Caspase-3 are of a Type I nature . However , the recovery of Bid-targeted shRNA from the screen suggested that in these cells , the mitochondrial route contributes to cellular execution by TRAIL . The mitochondrial pathway limits clonogenicity of Type I tumor cells after TRAIL treatment . As the Bid RNAi phenotype was revealed at the level of clonogenicity , subsequent assays were performed using this read out . For this purpose , MCF-7Casp-3 cells were treated with 50 ng ml IZ-TRAIL and examined for clonogenic outgrowth at day 15 . The RNAi for Caspase-8 gave rise to clonogenic resistance to TRAIL as compared with EV-transduced cells , serving as a positive control for the assay Figure 2a , b . In repeated assays , Bid RNAi mediated significant clonogenic resistance to TRAIL Figure 2a , b , also see 4c , d . To further address the relevance of the mitochondrial apoptosis signaling pathway , it was blocked by Bcl-2 over-expression . The MCF-7Casp-3 cells were retrovirally trans-duced with a Bcl-2-encoding vector or with EV as control Figure 2c . The overexpression of Bcl-2 conferred resistance to TRAIL , confirming that the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway contributed to clonogenic death of MCF-7Casp-3 cells after TRAIL treatment Figure 2d , also see 6b , c . To examine whether this phenotype could be observed in other Type I cells , we used the B-lymphoma cell line SKW6.4 and the breast carcinoma cell line T47D.11 The SKW6.4 cells were transduced with EV or a vector encoding Bcl-2 and T47D cells with EV or a Bid-targeting shRNA Bid shRNA2 . Immunoblot-ting demonstrated effective Bcl-2 overexpression in SKW6.4 cells Figure 2e and silencing of Bid protein expression in T47D cells Supplementary Figure 1a . The overexpression of Bcl-2 in SKW6.4 cells did not significantly affect TRAIL-induced Caspase-3 cleavage , in line with the Type I classification , 11 but it did produce clonogenic resistance to TRAIL Figure 2f , g . Similarly , Bid RNAi produced clonogenic resistance to TRAIL in T47D cells Supplementary Figure 1b . These results demonstrate that the intrinsic apoptosis pathway limits clonogenic outgrowth of Type I cells after TRAIL treatment . Caspase-9 is not required for TRAIL receptor-induced clonogenic cell death in Type I cells . To study the importance of Caspase-9 activity for TRAIL-induced clonogenic cell death in Type I cells , we expressed a catalytically inactive mutant dnCaspase-9 in MCF-7Casp-3 cells Figure 3a . To validate the dominant negative effect of this mutant , we tested Caspase-3 cleavage in response to irradiation with UV light , as this is completely dependent on the intrinsic pathway.23 The UV-induced Caspase-3 cleavage was completely abrogated in dnCaspase-9-overexpressing cells , indicating that endogenous Caspase-9 activity was effectively inhibited Figure 3b . To study the effect of Caspase-9 on TRAIL-induced Caspase-3 cleavage , EV-transduced and dnCaspase-9-transduced cells were exposed to different dosages of TRAIL for 3 h . Noticeably , dnCapase-9 did not inhibit TRAIL-induced Caspase-3 cleavage at any dose Figure 3c . In contrast to previous effects of Bid downregulation or Bcl-2 overexpres-sion , Caspase-9 inhibition did not significantly rescue MCF-7Casp-3 cells from TRAIL-induced clonogenic death , as documented by visual inspection Figure 3d and by the quantification of colonies Figure 3e . Similar results were obtained when Caspase-9 expression was silenced in MCF-7Casp-3 cells by RNAi Supplementary Figure 2 . We conclude from these findings that Caspase-9 activity is not required for TRAIL-induced Caspase-3 cleavage and clono-genic death in Type I cells . Smac DIABLO is essential for TRAIL-induced clonogenic cell death in Type I cells . Having ruled out an essential contribution of Caspase-9 to execution of Type I cells after TRAIL stimulation , we examined the relevance of Smac DIABLO release . For this purpose , we used a Smac DIABLO mutant DSmac , which lacks its mitochondrial-targeting sequence and therefore solely resides in the cytosol.14 The MCF-7Casp-3 cells , in which Bid expression was silenced by Bid shRNA1 Figure 4a , were stably transduced with DSmac-encoding vector or the empty control vector . Cells transduced with empty vectors served as control EV1 ? EV2 . Subcellular fractionation , followed by immunoblotting confirmed that DSmac was expressed in the cytosol , whereas the endogenous molecule exclusively resided in the mitochondrial fraction of unstimulated cells Figure 4b . By expressing DSmac in cells that had their mitochondrial pathway blocked by Bid RNAi , we created a situation in which only Smac DIABLO and no other mitochondrial effectors could be operational in the cytosol . The EV cells and Bid RNAi cells expressing DSmac or control vector both encoding green fluorescent protein , GFP were treated with 50 ng ml TRAIL for 15 days and assayed for clonogenicity Figure 4c , d . Bid RNAi mediated significant clonogenic resistance to TRAIL , whereas expression of DSmac in Bid RNAi cells significantly decreased the number of resistant colonies Figure 4d . This finding indicates that Smac DIABLO has an important role in the clonogenic elimination of Type I cells by TRAIL . We considered that stable expression of DSmac DIABLO in Bid RNAi cells might lead to a selection of cells adapting to its presence . Therefore , we also treated Bid RNAi MCF-7Casp-3 cells acutely with the cell-permeable synthetic Smac DIABLO mimetic LBW242 . This mimetic , LBW242 , is a chemical compound that competes with Smac DIABLO for binding to the BIR3 pocket of XIAP.24 Bid RNAi was performed using a second shRNA Bid shRNA2 , to exclude any off-target effects of Bid shRNA1 . This Bid shRNA2 also efficiently silenced Bid expression Figure 4e . After 15 days of treatment with IZ-TRAIL , in absence or presence of 10 mM or 20 mM LBW242 , resistant colonies were visualized and quantified Figure 4f , g . Bid RNAi with the shRNA2 mediated significant clonogenic resistance of MCF-7Casp-3 cells to TRAIL Figure 4g . At both doses , LBW242 reduced the clonogenicity of Bid RNAi cells , with the 20 mM concentration bringing it back to the level of EV-transduced cells Figure 4g . Together , these observations indicate that the release of Smac DIABLO from mitochondria is essential to limit clono-genicity of Type I cells after TRAIL treatment . Effector caspase activity is hampered in Bid RNAi cells but restored by Smac DIABLO mimetic . Our data suggested that the mitochondrial pathway contributes to clonogenic death of Type I cells by releasing effector caspases from XIAP inhibition after their initial activation by Caspase-8 10 . To validate this , we compared the proteo-lytic processing of effector caspases and their substrates in control and Bid RNAi MCF-7Casp-3 cells after TRAIL stimulation . In repeated assays , we consistently revealed a reduced efficiency in processing of the 36-kDa Caspase-7 proform to its 32-kDa cleavage product p32 in Bid RNAi cells as compared with EV control cells Figure 5 . This was best observed at the low dose of 25 ng ml IZ-TRAIL , but also visible at the 50-ng ml dose used in the clonogenic assay data not shown . Caspase-7 can remove the pro-domain from its own proform to generate p32,25 and therefore this may reflect reduced Caspase-7 activity . Moreover , the p20 form of Caspase-7 , which results from autoprocessing , 25 was less efficiently generated in Bid RNAi cells Figure 5 . For Caspase-3 , we observed that in Bid RNAi cells , the conver-sion of the 20-kDa cleavage form p20 to its fully processed 17-kDa form p17 was less efficient Figure 5 . This indicated a reduced activity of effector caspases in Bid RNAi cells , as p20 is generated by Caspase-8 , which cleaves pro-Caspase-3 at Asp175 between the large and the small subunits , whereas p17 is generated by removal of the pro-domain by auto-catalytic effector caspase activity.19,26 This difference in Caspase-3 processing was not revealed in the flow cytometric assay as statistically significant , although there was a modest reduction in case of Bid RNAi cells Figure 1c . Reduced effector caspase activity in Bid RNAi cells was reflected by a reduced efficiency in proteolytic processing of their substrate PARP Figure 5 . Importantly , treatment with the Smac mimetic , LBW242 , restored effector caspase processing and PARP cleavage to the extent observed in EV control cells Figure 5 . These data indicate that the mitochondrial release of Smac DIABLO allows for full effector caspase activation in Type I cells . XIAP inhibition is important for TRAIL-induced clonogenic cell death in Type I cells . To study the importance of XIAP inhibition by the mitochondrial pathway for TRAIL-induced clonogenic death in Type I cells , we silenced its expression by RNAi . The Bcl-2-overexpressing MCF-7Casp-3 cells were stably transduced with EV or a vector encoding an XIAP-targeting shRNA that effectively silenced XIAP protein expression Figure 6a . Clonogenicity of these cells relative to control was examined after treatment with 50 ng ml TRAIL for 15 days Figure 6b . The overexpression of Bcl-2 conferred significant clonogenic resistance to TRAIL in MCF-7Casp-3 cells Figure 6c . The RNAi-mediated downregulation of XIAP in turn significantly reduced clonogenicity of the Bcl-2-overexpressing MCF-7Casp-3 cells after TRAIL treatment Figure 6c . This indicates that XIAP levels limit the potential of the TRAIL receptor s to clonogenically execute Type I tumor cells through the direct , mitochondrion-independent pathway . Release of IAP inhibitors by the mitochondria facilitates this execution , as follows from the potential of DSmac DIABLO and Smac DIABLO mimetic LBW242 to increment sensitivity to TRAIL in Bid RNAi MCF-7Casp-3 cells Figure 4d , g . The XIAP RNAi did not restore clonogenic death to control levels , suggesting that the mitochondrial IAP antagonists have additional targets , besides XIAP , through which they enhance cellular execution after TRAIL treatment . Low Caspase-3 expression favors clonogenic survival of Type I cells upon TRAIL treatment . A recent report showed that cell-to-cell variability in protein levels or states can significantly influence the apoptotic response of Type I cells to TRAIL treatment.27 In this regard , decreased levels of pro-apoptotic proteins and or increased levels of anti-apoptotic proteins could cause clonogenic resistance to TRAIL . To examine this , we selected Bcl-2-overexpressing MCF-7Casp-3 cells and SKW6.4 cells for 2 weeks with TRAIL . Next , by immunoblotting we compared the levels of Caspase-8 , -6 , -7 , -3 , XIAP , cIAP-1 and cIAP-2 expression in these cells with those in unselected control cells . In repeated experiments , no significant differences in Caspase-8 , -6 , cIAP-1 and cIAP-2 expression were observed in TRAIL-selected cells as compared with control cells Figure 7a , b . In both cell lines , however , Caspase-3 levels were strongly reduced and Caspase-7 levels were somewhat reduced . In MCF-7Casp-3 cells , XIAP levels were unaltered and in SKW6.4 cells they were slightly reduced , but clearly in both cases , cells that resisted TRAIL-induced apoptosis were hallmarked by a higher XIAP-to-effector caspase ratio . This finding underlines that clonogenic execution of Type I tumor cells by TRAIL through the mitochondrion-independent pathway can be limited by the availability of active effector caspases . Discussion Prompted by the unbiased recovery of Bid-targeting shRNA from a RNAi screen in Type I MCF-7Casp-3 cells , we have re-examined the relevance of the mitochondrial pathway for the execution of Type I cells by death receptors . Using Type I MCF-7Casp-3 and T47D breast carcinoma cells , and SKW6.4 B lymphoma cells in clonogenic assays , we have demonstrated that the mitochondrial pathway limits the clonogenic outgrowth of Type I tumor cells after TRAIL treatment . Type I cells are generally assumed not to require mitochondria for death receptor-induced apoptosis.10 The Type I Type II distinction was originally made for tumor cells4 and was later proved valid for primary cell types as well . Among these , thymocytes and hepatocytes are the prototype Type I and Type II cells , respectively . The Type II nature of hepatocytes followed from their response to in vivo stimulation with CD95 Fas agonists , which killed wild-type mice by hepatic injury , whereas Bcl-2 transgenic , Bid or Bax Bak mice proved to be resistant.5,9,28 In contrast , genetic deficiency for Bid5 or Bax and Bak29 did not overtly affect the cell death response of thymocytes to CD95 Fas stimulation . Our study points out that the mitochondrial contribution to death receptor-mediated execution of Type I cells is subtle , but important , particularly when one considers the implica-tions for tumor therapy by death receptor agonists . We demonstrate that the mitochondrial contribution to tumor cell execution by TRAIL is revealed when clonogenic outgrowth of the treated population is considered . In our clonogenic assays , Bid deficiency or Bcl-2 overexpression rescued about 3.5�5 % of the MCF-7Casp-3 cells from execution by 50 ng ml IZ-TRAIL . In case of SKW6.4 B lymphoma cells also about 5 % of cells in the population were rescued from execution by 200 ng ml IZ-TRAIL on Bcl-2 overexpression . This effect , which will become increasingly prominent on lowering the TRAIL dose , is relevant in vivo where death receptors control the damage done by chronically stimulated or autoreactive T lymphocytes CD95 30 and the metastatic spread of solid tumors TRAIL receptor .31,32 Moreover , TRAIL receptor agonists are currently in Phase I II clinical trials for cancer therapy.33 Blockade of the intrinsic apoptosis pathway is a frequent occurrence in cancer and is expected to impact on the effectiveness of TRAIL therapy , also in case of tumors with a �Type I� classification . The intrinsic pathway enables effector caspase activity by two mechanisms 1 Caspase-9 can cleave the effector caspase zymogens , and thereby activate them 2 Smac DIABLO and HtrA2 Omi alleviate cleaved effector caspases from inhibition by XIAP . Although Caspase-9 is absolutely required as inducer caspase for cell death responses that operate through the intrinsic pathway , 23,34 this is different for cellular execution by death receptors . We show here that TRAIL kills Type I MCF-7Casp-3 breast carcinoma cells equally well at the clonogenic level whether the cells have Caspase-9 activity or not . Different from Bid thymocytes , 8 Caspase-9 23,34 or Apaf-1 35 thymocytes responded equally well in caspase activation assays on CD95 Fas treatment as wild-type thymocytes . This agrees with our findings and indicates that the apoptosome and Caspase-9 do not make a significant contribution to effector caspase activation by death receptors in Type I cells . Presumably , Caspase-8 10 activity suffices for the initial activation of the effector caspases . Recent data indicate that in Type II cells also , Caspase-9 activation by the mitochondrial route is not essential for apoptotic execution after death receptor stimula - tion in Type II Jurkat cells , the apoptosome did not contribute to CD95 Fas-induced apoptosis in short-term assays.36 Moreover , in hepatocytes , Bid deficiency did not affect CD95 Fas-induced processing of pro-Caspase-3 to the p20 form.37 Importantly , this study by Li et al.37 defined effector caspase inhibition by X IAP proteins as the bottleneck for CD95 Fas-mediated execution in Bid hepatocytes the p20 form of Caspase-3 was not further processed to its p17 form , whereas this processing did occur in wild-type hepatocytes by virtue of Smac DIABLO release from the mitochondria . This research forms the important precursor of the work by Jost et al. , 8 who recently reported that genetic ablation of XIAP sufficed to convert Type II hepatocytes to a Type I response profile on CD95 Fas stimulation . Together , these two studies indicate that for death induction by CD95 Fas in hepatocytes , XIAP inhibition rather than effector caspase activation by Caspase-9 is the critical factor contributed by the intrinsic pathway . A recent study in Jurkat cells provides compelling evidence for the same conclusion.36 In colon carcinoma cells , XIAP downregulation similarly allowed a conversion from a Type II to a Type I response to TRAIL in short-term apoptosis assays.38 Hence , although it was generally assumed that Type II cells require Caspase-9 activity to increment effector than cIAP-1 or cIAP-2 , whose prominent role lies in the regulation of NF-kB activation.13 The downregulation of XIAP by RNAi consistently reduced clonogenicity of TRAIL-treated MCF-7Casp-3 cells , indicating that Smac DIABLO release from mitochondria promoted clonogenic death by overruling XIAP activity . However , DSmac DIABLO and in particular LBW242 reduced clonogenicity to a greater extent than XIAP RNAi , suggesting that they in addition promoted cellular execution by another mechanism , most likely by targeting other IAPs . Elegant studies have recently addressed control points in TRAIL-induced apoptosis at the single cell level.12 Within a Type II tumor cell population HeLa , individual cells exhibited distinct delays in MOMP after inducer caspase activation . In this period , XIAP � that might be expressed at different levels between cells � restrained effector caspase activity . Accord-ingly , Spencer et al.27 reported cell-to-cell variability in the timing and probability of cellular execution by TRAIL . Clonogenic assays are apt to reveal such variability and in the two Type I tumor cell lines tested in our study , certain cells within the population were dependent on the mitochondria for clonogenic execution because of low Caspase-3 levels . The downregulation of XIAP by RNAi restored sensitivity in a significant proportion of these cells . We conclude that the difference in TRAIL receptor signaling between Type II and Type I cells is not qualitative , but rather quantitative with ranges of differential responsiveness within a population . caspase activation by the extrinsic pathway , there is no abundant experimental evidence for this . At the biochemical level , most of the abovementioned studies did not reveal effects of the mitochondrial pathway on CD95 Fas-induced Caspase-3 cleavage or effector caspase activity . However , Yin et al.5 reported a delay in Caspase-3 cleavage and effector caspase activity in Bid thymocytes . Jost et al.8 similarly found reduced or delayed effector caspase activity in CD95 Fas-stimulated Bid thymocytes Type II , which was partially rescued by XIAP deficiency . We detected a reduced efficiency in effector caspase processing and activity on mitochondrial inhibition by immunoblotting . Although differences were not statistically significant in the flow cytometric assay Figure 1c , a modest reduction in the percentage of cells with cleaved Caspase-3 was also observed . These data are consistent with the concept that XIAP restrains effector caspase activity . Using the cytosolic DSmac variant , we show that Smac DIABLO release from mitochondria is essential for clonogenic elimination of Type I tumor cells by TRAIL . Use of the LBW242 Smac DIABLO mimetic corroborated this , although its me-chanism of action involves more than XIAP elimination.39,40 The IAP family is characterized by BIR domains and contains multiple proteins of diverse function.13,39 Among these , XIAP , cIAP-1 and cIAP-2 are implicated in death-receptor signaling and all are targeted by Smac DIABLO mimetics . Among IAPs , XIAP is seen as the only bona fide effector caspase inhibitor , as it alone can shield the catalytic site of the effector caspases . It indeed has a much greater inhibitory activity Cells and stimulation .

Among these , neurotrophins NTs belong to a well-characterized family including nerve growth factor NGF � which was the first GF to be identified.1,2 Although the term trophic is widely used to indicate , as previously mentioned , a generalized �nutritional� action mediated through several metabolic pathways , more detailed and in-depth experiments have indicated that this term is often too broad or ambiguous . NGF , for instance , has been shown to exert not only its anti-apoptotic and nerve growth-promoting activity � which is the first property that led to its discovery � but it has also been subsequently identified and characterized for its more subtle , experimentally distinguishable tropic and pro-differentiative actions on its target neurons . NGF first came to light for its vigorous , extraordinary nerve growth-promoting activity on chick embryo sensory ganglia . Later , it was also reported that sympathetic ganglia degenerated and massively died when deprived of NGF with a novel and ingenious mani-pulation , defined as immunosympathectomy.3�5 Thus , the nerve growth-promoting action found in sensory ganglia was extended in a significantly and pronounced �trophic� vital effect , exerted in sympathetic neurons Figure 1 . Finally , such a dual cellular effect was confirmed by the discovery that NGF was endowed with the property of directing nerve fiber growth toward the cells that produce and release it , hence the definition of tropic effect.6 Subsequent studies � performed on in vitro cultured sympathetic neurons � showed that these cells , when deprived of NGF , die due to the activation of programmed cell death . These findings provided a more specific definition of the broader term �trophic�.7 The aim of this short review is to argue the point that an even more specific and complete definition of the anti-apoptotic action exerted by NGF � and most probably by other NTs � consists in keeping under control the amyloidogenic processing of amyloid precursor protein APP , which has been hypothesized among the primary triggers in AD pathogenesis.8�10 According to this view , the pro-survival , NGF-mediated activity on its target neurons seems to consist of an inhibitory effect on amyloid-b Ab peptide s over-production . This appears to be sufficient in inducing several intracellular changes � involving NGF receptor itself and tau protein � that eventually lead to neuronal death . Apoptosis and Amyloidogenic APP Metabolism in AD AD is the most common age-related neurodegenerative disorder accompanied by progressive memory and cognitive deficits . It is characterized by massive neuronal cell and synapse loss in limbic brain areas � such as hippocampus and amygdala � and also in specific cortical and subcortical regions.11 Neuropathological hallmarks are the extracellular insoluble senile plaques SPs � aggregated deposits of small Ab peptide s , referred to as Ab1-40 or Ab1-42 � and the intracellular neurofibrillary tangles NFTs � composed of hyperphosphorylated and truncated forms of tau protein.12�14 Extensive in vitro and in vivo genetic and biochemical studies have also unequivocally shown that AD is causally linked to an altered production of Ab , due to a b-and g-secretase-mediated processing of APP or to its impaired clearance.15 Furthermore , according to the �amyloid cascade hypothesis� , Ab peptides have a pivotal role by promoting or exacerbating tau pathology , but their neurotoxicity is also strictly dependent on this cytoskeleton-associated protein16�19 controlling micro-tubule assembly and stabilization.20 A genetic component , such as mutations in several genes linked to AD familial forms APP , presenilin-1 , PS1 , or presenilin-2 , PS2 , gene known to alter Ab cellular processing or its properties , leading to an increase of the Ab42 ratio or its propensity to aggregate , has 40 been shown only for a small percentage 5�8 % of the entire population of affected patients.21 A large part of AD forms are defined in being of a sporadic nature because no precise cause has been established . Moreover , the term �sporadic� would suggest a limited inci-dence of AD dementia whereas , on the contrary , this disease afflicts a growing number of human beings and is prospected to grow with the progressive increase of the elderly popu-lation . For instance , in the United States the number of AD patients is of approximately 2.5 million and it has been anticipated that by the year 2050 it will double . Several environmental risk factors have been hypothesized for the pathogenesis of idiopathic AD forms . Among these factors , excessive caloric intake , low scholarity , gender , apolipoprotein Ee4 variant , metal or pesticide exposure that could act during oxidative stress , mitochondrial damage , DNA damage repair , altered Ca2 ? homeostasis , trophic factors deprivation and inflammatory microglial activation.22 How-ever , as AD is a multifactorial disorder , each of these possible age-related causes provides little possibility in developing clinical prevention and therapies . Therefore , it is likely that AD will be a growing social and economic problem in the next years worldwide . Despite the genetic evidence in favor of the amyloid hypothesis , how self-association of a misfolded protein leads to the organ dysfunction and neurodegeneration character-istic of this disorder remains to be elucidated . Alternatives to Amyloid Hypothesis According to the amyloid hypothesis , the accumulation and deposition of fibrillar Ab is the primary trigger of neurodegen-eration and cognitive decline leading to dementia . This hypothesis has been sustained by several studies , including data from genetic studies of AD.21 All four of the established AD genes , the APP , the PS1 , PS2 and APOE , display mutations that increase the relative rate of production of Ab42 , the longer form of the peptide that is much more prone to oligomerization and fibrillation than Ab40.21 The traditional amyloid hypothesis is however debatable , mainly because spatial and temporal patterns of SP consisting of fibrillar Ab do not correlate very well with the degree of dementia in AD . In contrast , cognitive decline shows a deep relationship with loss of synaptic contacts.23,24 Recent studies highlight the �synaptic Ab hypothesis� , which underlines the pathogenic role of early assembly intermediates non-fibrillar Ab oligomers at synapses . In this regard , reduction of synapses , due to oligomeric Ab , subsequent death of neurons with loss of connections and neurotransmitters cause personal devas-tation , memory loss and eventually dementia.25 As far as the molecular mechanisms by which oligomer Ab promotes synaptotoxicity is concerned , it has been reported that Ab42 reduces , through mechanisms involving nicotine receptor and NMDA receptor , density of synapses leading to attenuated glutamatergic transmission and impaired synaptic plasticity.26 Others have suggested that Ab may cause oxidative stress , which can detrimentally affect synaptic integrity.27 Therefore , in AD , early memory loss could be caused by early oligomeric intermediates of Ab-derived diffusible ligand that first disrupt synaptic plasticity and subsequently cause neuronal death by mechanisms that require specific binding and signal transduc-tion molecules.28 Amyloidogenesis and Apoptosis The studies linking unphysiological apoptosis and amyloido-genesis in AD initiated a decade ago , when we hypothesized that an incorrect activation of apoptosis may be the triggering cause s of the intracellular cascade of events leading to selective neuronal death , 29 underlying such neurodegenera-tive disorder . To test this hypothesis , we performed preli-minary experiments on primary cerebellar granule neurons CGNs partially deprived 5.0 mM of high depolarizing concentrations 25 mM of extracellular KCl , a culture condi-tion required for their in vitro survival.29 We found that apoptotic death occurred after K ? starvation � possibly because it mimics the in vivo mossy fibers deafferentation induced by axotomy30 � and that this was reversible up to 4�8 h after treatment with high concentration of KCl , forskolin and IGF-1.29 Neuronal loss was characterized by de novo RNA protein synthesis and coordinated gene expression , 31 nuclear condensation and fragmentation , decrease of intra-cellular free calcium levels32 and by an imbalance of the physiological APP metabolism toward the amyloidogenic noxious counterpart . The amount of aAPPs the �good� form of APP generated by a-secretase-mediated pathway released in conditioned apoptotic medium was significantly decreased , whereas bAPPs the �bad� form of APP produced by b-g-secretase-mediated cleavage inversely increased , in the absence of any significant change of intracellular level of full-length APP.33 The overproduced extracellular 4 kDa Ab peptides Ab1-40 Ab1-42 aggregated into oligomeric and high-molecular-weight species of different size and morphology . Contextually , tau protein post-translational modifications � such as site-specific change of its phosphorylation state and caspase s and calpain-I-mediated cleavage � occurred with a consequent microtubule disassembly in dying neurons.34 Furthermore , if one of such truncated tau forms was introduced into the same healthy neurons by adenovirus-mediated transduction , it evoked a massive and rapid cell death35 involving extrasynaptic NR2B-subunit-containing NMDARs , dephosphorylation of cAMP-response-element-binding protein , sustained and delayed activation of extracellular-regulated kinases 1 2 and calpain-I.36 In addition , the pro-apoptotic shifting to a low potassium medium induced a marked failure of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation , accompanied by a dramatic intracellular ATP drop and by an increased production of reactive oxidative species.37�39 A functional impairment of proteasomes , causing a progressive accumulation of ubiquitinated-unfolded proteins in the cytoplasm , 40 and an early perturbation of autophagic� lysosomal structures were also revealed in apoptotic neurons.41 Interestingly , co-culture experiments showed that an Ab antibody partially inhibited the �transfer� of apoptotic process to healthy , but separated neighboring neurons . This finding suggested that the Ab pool released by apoptotic neurons diffused to the healthy cells , creating an autocrine toxic loop Figure 2 .42 NGF as an Anti-amyloidogenic factor the NGF-PC12 system NGF-differentiated rat PC12 cells represent an excellent experimental cellular model to investigate the NGF biological properties and its mechanism of action.43 This clonal cell line undergoes a progressive mitotic arrest and neuronal differentiation when incubated with NGF and dies when this NT is withdrawn from the culture medium.43 As it was interesting to assess whether such apoptotic events would be followed by , or be due to , excessive Ab production , as previously reported in CGNs , we carried out similar set of experiments in this in vitro apoptotic paradigm . We found that a parallel release and accumulation of secreted Ab peptide s � with prevalence of Ab1-42 over Ab1-40 peptides � occurred during the progressive death of NGF-deprived differentiated PC12 cells . The released pool K25 S� K25 of Ab , isolated on ultracentrifugation , was also found to form aggregates of different molecular size that were partially SDS-resistant and moderately soluble in formic acid 70 % , a condition generally used to dissolve Ab-positive aggregates extracted in vivo from human SP of AD subjects.44 The secreted Ab seemed also to affect healthy neurons , in a similar manner to that previously found in CGC , prompting the setup of experimental conditions to answer the following question if Ab is the upstream trigger � a molecular �killer� of healthy neurons � could its inhibition reduce or block the timing extent of cell death occurring after NGF deprivation ? We found that the downregulation of amyloidogenic APP processing with selective b-and g-secretase s inhibitors or 4G8 antibody Ab residues 17�24 significantly reduced the apoptotic death of NGF-deprived PC12 neurons.45 In our opinion , these results not only provide the first clear evidence linking apoptosis and amyloidogenic APP metabolism , but also gives new insights into the causal and temporal sequence of events occurring during neuronal death induced by the lack of trophic supply . Having established the �active� role of Ab peptide in neuronal death , a still unresolved problem was do caspase s work upstream , the amyloidogenic APP derouting evoked by NGF deprivation or do they become part of the scenario only at a later stage , when Ab has already � so to speak � prepared the action field for their subsequent effects ? Previous studies have shown that caspase 3-mediated APP cleavage at APP72046 directly elevated Ab production in serum-deprived human neuronal NT2 cells . Intracellular post-translational depletion of GGA3 � an adaptor protein that is required for BACE namely b-secretase lysosomal degradation � after caspase 3-dependent truncation , prolonged the half-life of such enzyme and indirectly enhanced Ab generation in staurosporine-treated H4-APP751 cell line.47 Conversely , among all cell-permeable and selective caspase s inhibitors tested in NGF-deprived PC12 , only blockage of executor caspases 2 , 12 , 6 and 8 partially reduced death and Ab production , whereas pharmacological inhibition of effector caspase 3 did not exert a similar action.45 Apoptosis induced by serum deprivation or by oxygen peroxide treatment under mild exposure conditions , at variance with NGF , evoked an apoptotic neuronal death that was not inhibited by b-and g-secretase inhibitors or by 4G8 antibody . Finally , the finding that the general caspase s inhibitor z-VAD did not signi-ficantly affect the production of Ab structure and cell death in NGF-deprived PC12 , whereas it partially blocked caspase s -mediated tau truncation48 and rescued neurons from apoptotic death45 suggests a complex causal and temporal relationship between caspase s , APP amyloidogenic processing and tau metabolism in NGF-deprived cell death . Therefore , whether caspase s activation is a terminal process associated with neuronal death , or a more proximal event that promotes the AD-like pathology in these cells , remains to be still proven . The actual link between apoptosis and amyloidogenesis is further corroborated in NGF-deprived primary hippocampal cultures , a neuronal population directly affected in human AD patients , which underlies the anatomopathological and clinical signs of such neurodegenerative dementia.49�52 In a preliminary set of in vitro experiments , we attempted to confirm data previously obtained in NGF-differentiated PC12 cells . Thus , even in NGF-deprived hippocampal neurons , we observed that 1 the released Ab extracellular peptides created a neurotoxic loop , because the extent of ensuing cell death was much greater than that expected on the potential number of NGF-responsive target neurons previously found 2 b-or g-secretase inhibitors � or mixture of both � and Ab antibody , 4G8 , largely prevented not only the Ab intra-and extra-production but also neuronal death.53 The temporal interplay between Ab overproduction and tau protein post-translational modifications was also established from the observation that two specific amino-acidic sites Ser 262 and Thr 231 � pathognomonic of abnormal AD-like tau protein detected in aggregated insoluble intracellular NFTs � were rapidly 3�6 h and transiently o12 h hyper-phosphorylated in hippocampal neurons on NGF withdrawal . The early , specific and temporally restricted phosphorylation state changes of tau were 1 temporally related to a decrease of the ratio of secreted aAPPs bAPPs 2 caused by a deregulation of Akt-GSK3b signaling , known to be in vivo correlated with the onset of AD pathology 3 mimicked by externally added synthetic Ab1-42 peptide , but not by reverse-sequence peptide Ab 42-1 4 sensitive to LiCl treatment and , more importantly , 5 significantly reduced on treatment with Ab antibodies or with b-and g-secretase s inhibitors.54 The increased pool of hyperphosphorylated tau , which is unable to bind microtubules , subsequently detached from them , as shown by the reduction in the intracellular level of acetyl stable -tubulin and by a concomitant increase of its a-tyrosinylated instable form . Contextually , a progressive disassembly of the cytoskeleton network occurred and the microtubule tracks-based axonal transport was acutely impaired , as shown from observing that mitochondria accu-mulated in the perykaryon and were no longer transported along axonal processes.54 The tau-dependent loss of microtubule integrity and axonal neuritic beading associated with jamming of mitochondria were also partially rescued by the treatment with Ab-antibody and GSK3b inhibitors . In addition , calpain-I and caspase 3 protease s were only late upregulated and pharmacological inhibition of such apoptotic proteases not only partially protected hippocampal neurons from death after the NGF removal , but also did not significantly interfere with GSK3b-mediated site-specific tau hyperphosphorylation . This suggests that the delayed caspase 3 calpain-I pathway does not regulate GSK3b-dependent changes of tau phosphorylation state , 54 in agreement with previous studies reporting that , in differentiated PC12 induced to cell death by NGF deprivation , the GSK3b kinase inhibition only exerted a small effect on the caspase s pathway.55 An early tau hyperphosphorylation , with a reduction of its microtubule binding affinity has been found in NGF-deprived differentiated PC12 cells.56 In addition , although other research groups have reported that Ab antibodies can reduce tau hyperphosphorylation in vitro and in vivo , 57,58 the func-tional relationship between endogenous overproduced Ab , tau hyperphosphorylation cleavage and apoptotic signaling in the same neuronal model has not been investigated before . Similar NGF-dependent modifications of site-specific tau phosphorylation have been found in the AD11 animal model , 54 in correlation with the temporal appearance of Ab peptide species.59 Interestingly , these anti-NGF transgenic AD11 mice , in which the in vivo phenotypic knockout of mature NGF is achieved by the expression of recombinant neutraliz-ing antibodies , resemble an AD-like neurodegeneration.60,61 Furthermore , a caspase s -mediated truncation of N-terminal tau domain , which possibly interacts with dynactin dynein motor complex , 62 also occurs in vitro and in vivo on NGF signaling interruption.48 GSK3b-mediated tau phosphory-lation is associated with a proper anterograde organelle transport63 in NGF-dependent differentiated PC12 , and synthetic Ab peptides cause a GSK3b-mediated impairment of mitochondrial transport in hippocampal cultured neurons.64 Finally , a mislocalization of pThr 231-tau protein and GSK3b in basal forebrain cholinergic neurons of aged rats is causally linked to an in vivo defective retrograde axonal transport.64,65 Paradoxical , unexpected Functional Switch of the TrkA Receptor TrkA belongs to the large family of tyrosine kinases trans-membrane receptors sharing , as a common denominator , the property of trans-autophosphorylating on binding to their cognate ligand . Receptor engagement with its specific NT changes the inactive conformation into an active state , which triggers and activates the appropriate signal transduction pathway s by recruiting intracellular adaptor proteins , effec-tors or both . The active conformation regains its inactive , dephosphorylated state within minutes after the extracellular concentration of ligand decreases to a value favoring the free unbound state.66,67 It was therefore an unexpected finding that , 24 h after NGF withdrawal , TrkA regained its phosphory-lated state pY490 in the apoptotic hippocampal primary neurons contextually to 1 an Akt dephosphorylation , 2 an upregulation of phospholipase-C g PLCg pathway and 3 the progression of neuronal death.68 This paradoxical , NGF-independent delayed TrkA phosphorylation could be assumed either as a side effect of death-inducing changes evoked by NGF withdrawal , or as an intracellular signaling linked to Ab increase . In subsequent experiments we confirmed this latter hypothesis . Incubation of NGF-deprived neurons with two different TrkA antagonists , namely K252 and CEP-2563 , generally used to inhibit TrkA autophosphoryla-tion , largely protected hippocampal cultures from apoptotic death . Furthermore , an identical anomalous TrkA post-translational modification was evoked in neurons by exogen-ously added synthetic Ab peptide , suggesting a causal relationship between NGF withdrawal , amyloidogenic APP metabolism and NGF-independent TrkA phosphorylation . Similarly , partial TrkA mRNA silencing paradoxically favored neuronal survival , suggesting that the NGF receptor may switch from pro-survival to pro-apoptotic action in the absence of its specific ligand . In addition , pharmacological inhibition of Cdk and Src kinases , known to trigger amyloidogenesis by affecting APP phosphorylation and processing , 69�72 reduced the TrkA and PLCg phosphorylation levels and rescued neuronal cultures from death . Relevantly , in p75-silenced neurons , TrkA did not appear phosphorylated after NGF removal and the interruption of the amyloidogenic pathway was prevented.68 Furthermore , in early periods after NGF removal , p75 and particularly CTF � its C-terminal fragment produced by a-secretase cleavage73 � bound Ab peptides and 28 kDa PS1 fragment one of the components of g-secretase complex74 and led to apoptotic death.68 These findings further support data previously reported about a p75 role as an early mediator of the toxic Ab75 effect and support the working hypothesis of a possible imbalance in secretase s activity as a possible cause triggering the amyloidogenic pathway activation.76 Together , these results also seem to open a new paradigm in the field of NGF intracellular signal transduction , because the same TrkA transmembrane receptor may switch from -microtubule collapse pro-survival to pro-apoptotic action , in the presence or absence of its physiological cognate ligand . In addition , the evidence that NGF receptors , directly or indirectly , interact with Ab peptide s and PS1 in apoptotic neurons and that analogous effects are induced by synthetic Ab exogenously added peptide53,68 corroborates the ongoing hypothesis of a cellular interplay between the NGF receptors TrkA and p75 and the amyloidogenic APP processing machinery Figure 3 .77 A deficit in NT is largely related to AD.22 NTs , such as NGF and BDNF , are acquiring a strong relevance due their crucial role in cortical and hippocampal plasticity and , ultimately , on behavior . Indeed , it has been reported that they exert neurotrophic actions on the cholinergic neurons of the basal forebrain , protecting them also against axotomy-induced neurodegeneration and age-related atrophy.78,79 Moreover , NGF as well as BDNF has been reported to increase hippocampal neurogenesis , in adult and aged male rat.52,80 Altogether , these findings are recently prospecting a new approach to prevent neuroplasticty impairment and cell death in AD.22 In vivo studies indicate NGF as therapeutic tool for targeting AD pathology . The intranasal administration of NGF and oral administration of two AchE inhibitors � ganstigmine and donepezil � improve the performance of two tests related to hippocampal function for place and context for object recognition and memory in AD11 mouse.81 Relevantly , the drug is in phase IIa studies in the United States for senile dementia associated with Alzheimer�s disease AD .82 One of the main problem related to NGF administration in vivo is the large dimension of this molecule that does not easily cross the blood�brain barrier , and on the short half-life . Therefore , delivery of neurotrophic factors to the brain remains a major challenge . For this reason , to facilitate the supply of NGF to the brain , many new protein delivery technologies have been developed . Among them , encouraging prospective derives from implantation , into the forebrain of patients with mild AD , of autologous fibroblasts genetically modified to express human NGF.83 Indeed , treated AD cases manifested an improvement of cognitive deficit , in absence of any long-term adverse effects . Moreover , new small molecules have been recently identified to modulate NGF receptor signaling in AD.84 Particularly , a non-peptidyl mimetic of the NT loop 1 domain LM11A-24 promotes p75NTR-mediated survival in hippocampal neuron and interferes with p75NTR-mediated apoptosis induced by proNGF in oligodendrocytes.85 In addition , neurotrophic factor-loaded microspheres have been used for the experimental treatment of some neurological disorders.86 Recombinant human NGF-loaded microspheres , implanted into the basal forebrain of the rats with fimbria-fornix lesion , induced a significant increase on the survival of axotomized cholinergic neurons in the medial septum and vertical diagonal branch.87All together , these in vivo data strongly support and encourage the therapeutic use of NGF for the AD prevention and cure .

After 24 h , neuronal viability was assayed as described previously Figure 3 Schematic drawing of a hypothesized temporal cascade of molecular and biochemical events occurring in NGF-deprived hippocampal neurons . After NGF withdrawal , amyloidogenic APP processing with Ab production early occurred in cultured hippocampal neurons . An intracellular p75 processing , that leads to C-terminal CTF and intracellular domain ICD fragments , also was detected . CTF p75 fragment bounded with the Ab peptides , whereas ICD p75 fragment co-localized with PSEN1 active forms into the nucleus . An NGF-independent Ab-mediated TrkA receptor hyperphosphorylation correlated with Cdk and Src activation , concomitantly with AKT dephosphorylation and related PLCg phosphorylation . Neurotrophin removal also induced AKT-mediated GSK3b activation , which � in turn � caused the site-specific tau protein phosphorylation at Ser 262 and Thr 231 epitopes . The reduced microtubule-binding affinity of hyperphosphorylated tau evoked the cytoskeleton collapse and the axonal transport impairment . Morphological and biochemical signs of classical apoptotic � namely caspase s -calpain I protease s activation and nuclear condensation � were only later detectable 
20431599	www.nature.com cdd The vacuolating cytotoxin A VacA is one of the major virulence factors produced by Helicobacter pylori , the Gram-negative bacterium that infects 450 % of the human popula-tion . H. pylori causes peptic ulcer disease and is an early risk factor for gastric cancer.1 VacA is not only the toxin responsible for vacuolization of cells exposed to H. pylori culture filtrates , 2 but also shows pleiotropic effects on mammalian cells.3,4 VacA is produced as a 140 kDa precursor , which is cleaved during secretion from the bacterium into a 87�95 kDa mature toxin . The latter can be further cleaved into an amino-terminal p37 domain and a carboxy-terminal p58 domain , which remain noncovalently linked . Secreted VacA is a flower-shaped oligomer , formed by six or seven monomers . After a short exposure to acidic or basic pH , the oligomer is disassembled and VacA becomes able to interact with lipid bilayers . Interaction with biological membranes triggers restoration of the oligomers to form anion-selective , voltage-dependent channels.5 The mem-brane channel-forming ability of VacA resides in its amino-terminal portion , and single amino acid substitutions P9A and G14A in the p37 domain completely abrogate it.6,7 Vacuoli-zation of epithelial cells by VacA is strictly dependent on the formation of anion-selective membrane channels , which are targeted to late endosomes after internalization of the toxin.3,5,8,9 Indeed , once bound to the cell surface , VacA is rapidly internalized by a pinocytic mechanism that involves F-actin but is independent of clathrin , dynamin , and of the ARF6 GTPase . It is then routed to early endosomes before reaching late endosomes.10,11 H. pylori has been associated with increased level of apoptosis in human gastric mucosa.12�15 It has been proposed that loss of specialized cells especially the gastric parietal cells resulted in alterations of crucial cellular cross-talk pathways , eventually leading to disturbed differentiation and to the initiation of the metaplasia dysplasia carcinoma sequence.16 Although multiple H. pylori factors , including products of cag pathogenicity island17 and lipopolysaccha-ride , 18 are likely to be involved , VacA is per se sufficient to induce cell death .19,20 Apoptosis is a genetically controlled , evolutionarily con-served pathway in which intracellular organelles have a major regulatory role . Mitochondria , in particular , integrate and amplify diverse apoptotic signals by releasing into the cytosol Cyt cytochrome c and other cofactors required for the activation of the effector caspases , which then dismantle the cellular structures . The release of cytochrome c is controlled by BCL-2 family members , which include both anti-and pro-apoptotic proteins . In a widely accepted model , the so-called �BH3-only� proapoptotic members of the family sense the damage signal and transmit it to the so-called �multidomain proapoptotics� BAX and BAK , which are required for the activation of the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis . Once activated by BH3-only proteins , BAX and BAK provide a physical pathway for the efflux of cytochrome c from mitochondria . In addition , they dictate steady-state Ca2 ? levels in the endoplasmic reticulum ER , thus controlling the response to Ca2 ? -mediated death stimuli.21 Apoptosis induced by VacA might follow the activation of the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis , as suggested by the ability of VacA to lower mitochondrial membrane potential Dcm 22 and to release cytochrome c.23 Accordingly , both a fusion protein between the N-terminal fragment of VacA p37 and GFP , and the purified toxin , localize to mitochondria.24 Loss of Dcm and cytochrome c release require the channel-forming domain of VacA.7,24,25 This led to the hypothesis that Dcm dissipation and or cytochrome c release were a direct consequence of a VacA channel in the mitochondrial inner membrane , independently from host factors.26 However , VacA activates the multidomain proapoptotic proteins BAX and BAK before the release of cytochrome c.27 This complicates the picture and leaves us with a number of open questions Is VacA targeted to mitochondria ? How ? Does it require BAX and BAK to kill ? Does it rely on adequate ER Ca2 ? levels or on the direct mitochondrial function of BAX and BAK ? In this study we used a genetic approach to investigate the mechanisms of apoptosis induced by VacA . VacA requires BAX and BAK at the mitochondrial level to kill . Unexpectedly , active VacA also induces the translocation of BAX to endosomes , in parallel with the co-segregation of endosomal and mitochondrial membranes . Co-segregation and cell death strictly depend on the channel-forming domain of the toxin and on the presence of BAX and BAK . Thus , the program of VacA-induced apoptosis includes an unexpected subroutine of BAX-and BAK-dependent endosomal juxtaposition to mito-chondria , extending the known roles of these proapoptotic proteins . Results Apoptosis by VacA requires integrity of its channel-forming domain and BAX and BAK . We evaluated whether apoptosis induced by H. pylori culture supernatant CS in mouse embryonic fibroblasts MEFs required the multidomain proapoptotics BAX and BAK . MEFs doubly deficient for Bax and Bak double knockout DKO 28 were resistant to apoptosis induced by the H. pylori supernatant when compared with their wild-type wt counterparts Figures 1a and b . We then verified whether apoptosis occurring in wt cells required the channel-forming activity of VacA . CS obtained from two isogenic mutants of H. pylori carrying a point mutation in the VacA gene P9A and G14A that renders the toxin unable of forming anion channels7,29 were greatly ineffective in inducing cell death Figure 1a and Supplementary Figure 1a . When we measured vacuolization of wt and DKO MEFs in response to the CS of H. pylori wt , we found that DKO cells were much more responsive , reaching maximal vacuolization after 5 h Figure 2 , whereas wt cells showed little or no vacuolization until 24 h not shown . As expected , DKO cells did not vacuolated after exposing to the CS of the H. pylori mutant strain not shown . Thus , vacuolization and apoptosis seem to be independent , with the former even stimulated by the lack of BAX and BAK . In conclusion , the proapoptotic proteins BAX and BAK are required for VacA-induced apoptosis , which relies on its VacA channel properties . VacA-induced apoptosis involves BAX-dependent regulation at the mitochondrial level . As BAX and BAK regulate apoptosis at multiple levels , 30 we reasoned that the insensitivity of DKO cells to VacA-induced apoptosis could reflect their downregulation of Ca2 ? levels in the ER . To test this possibility , we turned to a model of DKO MEFs whose multiple defects were genetically and selectively corrected the mitochondrial one by targeting BAX exclusively to mitochondria , and the ER one by overexpressing sarco endoplasmic reticulum Ca2 ? -ATPase SERCA , 30 the Ca2 ? -ATPase responsible for the uptake of Ca2 ? from the Cyt into the ER lumen.31 Expression of mitochondria-targeted BAX mtBAX restored the sensitivity of DKO MEF cells to VacA-induced apoptosis , although cells remained more viable than their wt counterparts compare Figure 3a with 1a , probably because of the lack of BAK . Conversely , the overexpression of SERCA had no effect Figure 3b . This indicates that VacA falls into the category of stimuli that require mitochondria-based multidomain proapoptotics and can proceed despite depleted intracellular Ca2 ? stores . As expected , CS from the H. pylori VacA P9A channel mutant was also unable to trigger apoptosis in mtBAX-corrected DKO cells . In conclusion , VacA recruits the so-called �mitochondrial gateway� of apoptosis to kill intoxicated cells . VacA induces BAX activation and its recruitment to mitochondria . In resting cells the multidomain proapoptotic protein BAX resides as a monomer in the Cyt or is loosely attached to intracellular membranes . Once cells are stressed by an apoptotic stimulus , BAX becomes active , exposes its C-terminal a-9 helix , and translocates to mitochondria.32�34 This conformational change can be monitored by following the exposure of new epitopes using specific antibodies . The wt H. pylori CS induced BAX activation and the parallel staining with anti-VacA antibodies revealed a partial , but significant , colocalization between the two proteins Figure 4a . No BAX activation was observed after administrating the CS of the mutant strain , again underlining the central role of the VacA channel-forming activity . The weaker VacA staining observed in the latter case was probably because of a less efficient entry of the toxin into the cell . We therefore waited until 48 h , when the staining of VacA increased yet , BAX did not become activated not shown . Furthermore , mitochondria purified from cells incubated for 24 h with wt CS revealed a clearcut recruitment of BAX that was completely absent in untreated cells or in cells exposed to the mutant strain Figure 4b . This was not a consequence of an increase in total BAX , as measured by specific immunoblotting in lysates of cell exposed to wt and mutant CS data not shown . The channel-forming region of VacA is required for its localization to mitochondria . Whether VacA is targeted to mitochondria during apoptosis , or is retained in late endosomes , remains an open question.23,24,27 Given the requirement of the mitochondrial gateway to induce apoptosis , we investigated the subcellular localization of VacA from its entry into the cell to the induction of apoptosis . In a preliminary set of experiments we verified that our subcellular fractionation of cells yielded pure mitochondrial and early and late endosomal fractions Figure 5 . We therefore monitored by immunoblotting the accumulation of VacA in purified mitochondrial and early and late endosomal subcellular fractions from cells incubated for 24 h with wt or with VacA P9A H. pylori CS . Wt VacA was present in both endosomal compartments , as expected for a toxin that enters the cells by endocytosis , and interestingly , in part also in the mitochondrial fraction Figure 6a . Conversely , VacA P9A accumulated in endosomal compartments without reaching mitochondria Figure 6a . Moreover , the mutated toxin was internalized less efficiently than the wt one , despite a similar concentration in the CS not shown . A gel overloaded with endosomal and mitochondrial proteins , purified from VacA P9A-intoxicated cells , permitted to exclude that the absence of the protein in mitochondrial fraction was because of its less efficient internalization Figure 6a . The role of the channel activity of VacA in its targeting to mitochondria was further confirmed by applying to the cells the other channel-defective mutant , VacA G14A 7 it accumulated in endosomes as well as the wt counterpart , but it did not reach mitochondria Supplementary Figure 1b . We further confirmed the subcellular localization of VacA by confocal microscopy using anti-VacA antibodies in MEFs expressing a mitochondrially targeted red fluorescent protein . Although in cells treated with the mutated VacA the distribution of the toxin-positive vesicles was clearly distinct from that of mitochondria , in cells incubated for 24 h with wt VacA several toxin-positive spots appeared closely apposed to mitochondria Figure 6b . Thus , association of VacA with mitochondria seems to require the same domain involved in channel formation . In VacA-intoxicated cells , endosomes are juxtaposed to mitochondria . Our previous experiments left open the question of how VacA transited from endosomes to mitochondria , leading to BAX activation . We therefore decided to follow the subcellular localization of VacA in infected wt and DKO cells in parallel with BAX activation in the former . The wt toxin accumulated in the endosomal fractions as early as 2 h and 30 min after infection , although a small portion of the protein was already detectable in the mitochondrial fraction . After 12 h , wt VacA was extensively retrieved in the mitochondrial fraction , whereas endosomes exclusively remained positive for the mutated toxin devoid of channel activity . Unexpectedly , in cells treated with the active H. pylori CS , after as soon as 2 h and 30 min , BAX was retrieved in the early endosomes fraction , devoid of contamination by Cyt , as confirmed by the absence of the cytosolic marker GAPDH Supplementary Figure 2b . The major proportion of BAX recruited on endosomes was not membrane integral , as confirmed by its sensitivity to alkali extraction Supplementary Figure 2a . Notably , no recruitment of active BAX was detected on endosomal and mitochondrial fractions in cells exposed to mutated VacA , as well as in untreated cells Figure 7 . Furthermore , wt VacA induced a progressive accumulation of early EEA1 and late LAMP1 endosomal markers in the mitochondrial fraction Figure 7 . In contrast , when cells were incubated with the mutant in the channel-forming region of VacA P9A mutant , both markers were confined to their correspondent fraction and did not co-purify with mitochondria Figure 7 . Similarly , neither endosomal markers nor BAX were found associated with mitochondria in cells exposed to the other channel-defective mutant , VacA G14A Figure 8a . Importantly , the endosomal fractions of wt VacA-treated cells were not positive for a mitochondrial marker Figure 8b , indicating that the retrieval of BAX in endosomes was not an epiphenomenon of the accumulation of mitochondrial fragments within the endosomal fraction . Thus , VacA induces a major alteration in vesicular traffic that results in co-segregation of early and late endosomes with mitochondria , a situation similar to that reported in Fas-activated T cells.35 This early alteration occurs around the same time as the accumulation of active BAX in the early endosomes fraction , well before its retrieval on mitochondria . It is noteworthy that no endosomal recruitment of the already mitochondrial BAK was observed not shown . Significant amounts of VacA accumulate in the mitochon-drial fraction after 12 h of intoxication Figure 7 , when apoptosis is still not measurable , suggesting that targeting precedes induction of death . To confirm this , we turned to DKO cells , in which we expected to recapitulate the targeting to mitochondria of VacA and their cofractionation with endosomes , in the complete absence of apoptosis . Surpris-ingly , in these cells VacA did not colocalize at all with mitochondrial markers , nor it induced a co-segregation of endosomal and mitochondrial membranes within 12 h of intoxication Figure 7 . At 24 h , a small portion of VacA appeared to be targeted to mitochondria , even if endosomal markers did not reach the mitochondrial fraction . We wished to confirm that mitochondria and endosomes become closer in cells intoxicated with VacA . Immunofluor-escence analysis of cells exposed to VacA further substan-tiated the ability of the wt toxin to promote juxtaposition between early late endosomes and mitochondria Figure 9 , and suggested an association of endosomal vesicles con-taining VacA with mitochondria . It is noteworthy that the relocalization of endosomes in proximity to mitochondria was not observed in cells exposed to intrinsic or extrinsic apoptotic stimuli , such as staurosporine , etoposide and TNF-a Supple-mentary Figure 3 . This suggests that juxtaposition of endosome to mitochondria occurs specifically in cell exposed to VacA and is not a general feature of apoptosis . Immunoelectron microscopy analysis performed on intoxi-cated MEF cells further corroborated this finding . Intoxication of wt MEFs with CS from H. pylori wt strain , but not from the mutant one , for 2 h and 30 min triggered the juxtaposition of endosomal compartments positive to the late endosomal marker lysobisphosphatidic acid LBPA to mitochondria Figure 10a and see quantification in b . At the same time , endosomal area remained the same in wt VacA-intoxicated and untreated cells Figure 10c . Unfortunately , any attempt to visualize early endosome-positive structures failed as a consequence of the very poor immunoreactivity of the EEA1 antibody in our immunoelectron microscopy protocol not shown . In conclusion , the combination of subcellular fractionation , imaging and immunoelectron microscopy indicates that in cells intoxicated with VacA , mitochondria and endosomes are in close proximity . Notably , at longer time points the juxtaposition evolves in the engulfment of mitochondria in autophagosomes not shown .36 Discussion In this study we report that in cells intoxicated with the H. pylori cytotoxin VacA endosomes are retrieved in close proximity to mitochondria , in parallel with the accumulation of the toxin in the latter organelle . The endosomal markers EEA1 specific for early endosomes and LAMP1 more typical of late endosomes are enriched in the mitochondrial fraction after as early as 2 h and 30 min from intoxication . Hence , the colocalization of VacA with Rab7 reported by Yamasaki et al.27 could reflect the same membrane mistargeting as documented here . We suggest that VacA targets mitochon-dria in virtue of the cross-talk between these organelles that may be enhanced during apoptosis induction.35 In support of this conclusion , in Bax Bak DKO cells that show no accumulation of endosomal markers in mitochondria , VacA remains confined at the endosomal level . The co-segregation of VacA and endosomal markers with mitochondria is not a mere consequence of apoptosis induction , because it occurs before any detectable cell death . Convergent traffic between endosomes and mitochondria has been previously documented in TNF-a-exposed hepato-cytes , 37 Fas-activated T cells35 and also reticulocytes , in which a direct shuttling of iron from one organelle to the other occurs without any cytosolic intermediary.38 In addition , changes in the intracellular localization of mitochondria and generation of clusters of organelles has been reported in a variety of apoptotic settings.39 Although this inter-organelle membrane traffic may be specific to some cellular contexts , the possibility that such a traffic pathway is constitutively present in other cell types deserves further investigation . Previous results showed that VacA induced activation of the proapoptotic proteins BAX and BAK.27 However , the main proapoptotic �multidomain� proteins BAX and BAK control not only the physical permeabilization of the outer membrane of mitochondria , 28 but also the levels of ER Ca2 ? and hence the susceptibility to Ca2 ? -dependent death stimuli.30 Our results lend support to a model in which VacA engages the so-called �mitochondrial gateway� of apoptosis . Cells lacking both Bax and Bak intoxicated with VacA do not die , indicating the requirement of these key mediators of apoptosis in the death by VacA . Re-expression of a BAX mutant exclusively targeted to mitochondria significantly restored cell sensitivity to the toxin , whereas the genetic correction of the reduced ER Ca2 ? levels of the Bax-and Bak-deficient cells did not restore their susceptibility to VacA . During apoptosis BAX can be targeted to different intracellular membranes , from mitochondria to ER to Golgi.40 However , to the best of our knowledge , BAX has never been reported to localize on endosomes . More importantly , these organelles could serve as platforms for BAX recruitment onto mitochondria . Our data would be consistent with two models 1 BAX is recruited to early endosomes in a VacA-dependent process BAX activated on endosomal membranes then drags the whole organelles to mitochondria by virtue of its affinity to the outer mitochondrial membrane and 2 alternatively , although a fraction of BAX is directly recruited to the mitochondrial membrane as a consequence of VacA intoxication , another fraction of BAX reaches the mitochondria through membrane trafficking involving endosomes . This latter model is consistent with the observation that the amount of BAX associated with mitochondria after 12 h of incubation with VacA is significantly greater than would be expected solely from its recruitment after intermixing of mitochondria with endosomes . The selectivity of BAX recruitment to early rather than late endosomes is not clear . Co-immunopreci-pitation did not reveal any interaction between VacA and the proapoptotic protein . However , this is not indicative that the two proteins do not interact for example , co-immunoprecipi-tation between BID and BAX is similarly negative as the interaction occurs in the membrane.41 This envisions a scenario in which VacA is responsible for the mistargeting of endosomal membranes close to the mitochondria . This seems to be an essential step for accumulation of VacA and BAX in mitochondria , thereby dictating the final amount of this proapoptotic protein accumulated in this organelle during VacA intoxication . The VacA-induced endosome relocalization , as well as the BAX recruitment onto these organelles , requires the channel-forming domain of VacA mutations in this region arrested the toxin in late endosomes , abrogated recruitment of BAX to endosomes and mitochondria and eliminated the proapoptotic effect of the toxin . Surprisingly , DKO cells are much more susceptible to vacuolization after VacA intoxication than their wt counterpart , showing that vacuolization and apoptosis are two genetically distinguishable processes , despite the requirement of chan-nel-forming domain for both . As the different vacuolization does not result from an increased entry of the toxin in DKO cells , it raises the intriguing possibility that BAX and BAK are involved in an intracellular traffic of membranes . In this scenario , the absence of BAX BAK would result in larger endosomes , explaining the pronounced effect of VacA on size and extent of vacuoles in DKO cells Supplementary Figure 2 . If the constitutive pathway of endosomal remodeling is somehow blunted by the lack of these multidomain proapoptotics , more membranes would be available for vacuolization by VacA . Consistently , VacA is unable to induce the co-fractionation of endosomes and mitochondria in DKO cells . In conclusion , our work shows that apoptosis induced by VacA requires BAX and BAK and is Ca2 ? independent . Furthermore , it elucidates the route used by VacA to target mitochondria in the course of apoptosis and indicates an unexpected new function for the key proapoptotic protein BAX in the dynamics of intracellular organelles .

20431600	www.nature.com cdd Myotonic dystrophy DM is a multi-systemic disorder caused by two different microsatellite expansions in non-coding regions . Together , these two mutations affect 1 out of 8000 individuals and represent the most common form of muscular dystrophy in adults . DM1 and DM2 have common symptoms such as myotonia , muscle weakness and early cataract development.1,2 Although DM1 and DM2 initially affect different muscles distal versus proximal , histological analy-sis of the muscular tissues shows common aspects such as central nucleation . The classic form of DM1 is characterized by muscle distress with myotonia , progressive muscle weakness and wasting . Atrophy has also been reported , occurring preferentially in type-1 fibers in DM1 and in type-2 in DM2.3 DM1 but not DM2 also presents a congenital form cDM1 , characterized by a high neonatal mortality and symptoms such as hypotonia , mental retardation and respira-tory distress.4,5 DM1 is associated with an unstable CTG trinucleotide expansion located in the 30-untranslated 30-UTR region of the DM protein kinase DMPK gene on chromosome 19q13.3 . The mutant DMPK transcript , containing the expanded CTG n sequence , accumulates in discrete nuclear foci able to sequester various nuclear factors such as RNA-binding proteins or splicing regulators , causing different and highly variable downstream deleterious effects.2,6 It has been reported that CTG n trinucleotide repeat length in muscle directly correlates with both frequency of severe cDM17 and rate of splicing impairment typical of DM.8 The pathology of skeletal muscle , including both myotonic and dystrophic features , has been reproduced in different mouse models by the following different strategies random insertion of a genomic fragment carrying the expanded sequence in its human DM1 context9 or in human skeletal actin HSA gene , 10 or insertion of a humanized DMPK locus containing a human expanded sequence.11 An inducible model for the pathology carrying 960 CTG and showing severe muscle wasting was also recently created.12 Cell models are also available , such as C2C12 lines expressing the CTG expansion13�17 or human DM1 fibroblasts converted into myoblasts by the induction of the myogenic factor MyoD.18,19 Use of human DM1 primary myoblasts cultures has been rare , owing to limited availability , and has resulted in contradictory findings.20�31 Various experimental models have been used to speculate about the possible effects of the DM1 mutation on the myogenic process and thus find explanation for the severe skeletal muscle immaturity and wasting of DM muscle.16 The most commonly accepted theory is that CTG expansion could affect differentiation of DM myoblasts by interfering with the signals leading to the withdrawal of cell cycle and the shift toward the differentiation program.26,32,33 However , it should be noted that the majority of the data on in vitro differentiation of DM muscle cells derive from studies on DM1 fibroblasts converted into skeletal muscle , 18,19 from primary muscle cell cultures obtained from cDM1 fetuses31 or from mouse muscle cells.14,15,17,33,34 No studies focusing on muscle differentia-tion of human primary DM1 myoblasts cultures obtained from adult muscle DM1 biopsies are available , underlining the need to work with a model as close as possible to human regenerating skeletal muscle . To address this point we chose as experimental model primary cultures from skeletal muscle biopsies of five healthy , six DM1 and two cDM1 patients with different degrees of pathology . Cultured cells at various times of differentiation were tested for their myogenic potential and for the main molecular markers associated with the DM1 pathology � number of foci and splicing alteration . Moreover , we investigated different catabolic pathways including the expression of the critical ubiquitin-ligases atrogin-1 and MuRF1 , apoptosis and autophagy in well-differentiated myotubes . We provide evidence that apoptosis and autop-hagy are possible mechanisms leading to degenerative loss of muscle tissue and impairment in regeneration . Results Differentiation of DM1 myoblasts is normal . Morphological , molecular and immunological analysis were performed during the first 15 days of differentiation in primary skeletal muscle cell culture lines derived from eight DM1 patients six adult-onset DM1 , two cDM1 Table 1 , with blood CTG repeats within n the DMPK gene mRNA ranging from 90�1800 and from five age-matched controls . Muscle terminal differentiation was induced by a shift to a medium containing a low concentration of mitogens . Normal and DM1 cells grew at the same rate and went through the same number 2�7 of passages . As our culture procedure established a mixture of fibroblasts and myoblasts , in all the cell lines the percentage of desmin-positive myoblast population was calculated and found to exceed 80 % . To compare the myogenic capacity of myoblasts from normal and DM1 patients we examined morphological aspects together with the expression of different markers of myogenesis at 4 and 10 days of differentiation stages T4 and T10 . Slow myosin heavy chain MHC and fetal myosin were detected by immunofluorescence Figure 1b Supplementary Figure 1 the levels of myogenin were estimated by a combination of RT-PCR and western assays Figure 1c , d1 and d2 the level of muscle-specific creatine kinase CK-M was quantified by RT-PCR Figure 1e . We found that in the T4-and T10-differentiated DM1 myotubes , all the tested parameters were similar to controls . A representative set of images in Figure 1a and b shows that the differentiation capacity was unaffected by the presence of the CTG n expansion . All the DM1 cell lines were then subjected to fusion assays . Again , the myogenic potential , expressed as number of syncytial nuclei per myotube , was similar to controls Figure 1f . Moreover , to check the maturation capacity of DM1 muscle cells , primary DM1 myotubes were innervated with sections of rat embryo spinal cord Supplementary Figure 1 insert B . This kind of procedure allows further muscle maturation to be achieved , thanks to the diffusion of axons from the gangliar roots.28,35,36 All the innervated DM1 myotubes acquired the ability to depolarize and contract as controls Supplementary movie . Taken together , these data suggest that our DM1 human primary myoblasts did not present any impairment in the early steps of myogenesis , behaving as controls until 10 days of differentiation . Pathological hallmark in DM1 muscle cells . To exclude the possible selection of healthy differentiating cells , our cultured DM1 myotubes were characterized for the presence of the main molecular hallmarks of the DM1 disease the presence of ribonuclear foci and the splicing misregulation of two genes representative of the DM1 spliceopathy , the insulin receptor IR and muscleblind-like 1 MBNL1 . In all DM1 myotubes expanded DMPK transcripts , accu-mulating in the nucleus together with nuclear proteins with affinity for the expanded CTG sequence , generated aggre-gates easily detectable by fluorescence in situ hybridization FISH , 37,38 confirming the presence of DMPK pathological transcripts in all the studied muscle cells Figure 2a . Aberrant isoforms of various genes , including IR-A and MBNL1 MBNL1ex7 , prevail in affected adult DM1 muscle in relation to the CTG expansion.8 To assess the in trans n effect of the CTG repetition on the splicing regulation in DM1 differentiating myoblasts , we analyzed the expression of IR and MBNL1 gene isoforms at different times of differentiation stages T0 , T4 and T10 . RT-PCR amplification showed that in DM1 cells the ratios of the IR-A TOT Figure 2b1 and b2 and MBNLex7 TOT Figure 2c1 and c2 increased in correlation with the CTG length and were significantly higher compared to controls especially in the E3 IR-A Po0.05 MBNL1 Po0.01 and E4 samples IR-A Po0.01 MBNL1 Po0.001 Figure 2b1 , b2 and c1 , c2 . Catabolic pathways in DM1 muscle cells . These results were accompanied by the observation that DM1 myotube population drastically decreased after 12�15 days of differentiation compared with controls Figure 3a , and that average width of DM1 myotubes with CTG expansion was n statistically reduced by 30 % compared with controls Po0.01 Figure 3c . Several studies showed that muscle atrophy is accompanied by a reduction in mean number of myonuclei per fiber . Consistently , we found a statistically reduced number of nuclei myotube in DM1 lines , by 16 % compared with controls Figure 3b .39 Together , these results suggested the activation of catabolic pathways in our muscle cells of DM1 patients . To characterize the signaling involved in DM1 myotubes loss , we investigated the presence of oxidative stress , the expression of atrophy-related genes and the activation of apoptotic and autophagic systems . Expression of Atrogin1 and Murf1 , the two critical atrophy-related muscle-specific ubiquitin-ligases , did not differ from controls data not shown . This finding suggests a minor contribution , at this time point , of ubiquitin-proteasome system to myotube loss . ROS produc-tion , tested in myotubes from 4 to 15 days of differentiation , did not show noticeable differences compared with controls at 4�10 days of differentiation data not shown . However , 15-day-differentiated DM1-E2 and cDM1-E4 myotubes sig-nificantly produced more H2O2 than controls Supplementary Figure 2 . This finding suggests that dysfunctional mitochon-dria or conditions that generate ROS persist in DM1-E2 and E4 myotubes and can therefore contribute to myotube wasting . We next monitored the presence of apoptosis by studying chromatin fragmentation by terminal deoxynucleotidyltrans-ferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling TUNEL , release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria and caspase-3 cleavage Figure 4 . All these approaches confirmed a higher amount of apoptosis in DM1 myotubes when compared with controls . Especially , TUNEL assay re-vealed a constant elevated presence of apoptotic nuclei in all DM1 myotubes during the differentiation , in particular , T10-T15 DM1-E21 , -E22 and cDM1-E41 , -E42 samples had B10�15 times more apoptotic myonuclei than control samples Figure 4a1 and a2 . Consistently , cytochrome c release Figure 4b1 and b2 and activation of caspase-3 Figure 4c1 and c2 were clearly increased in myotubes from the same lines of DM1-E2 and E4 , whereas DM1-E3 lines showed reduced apoptotic values , which were , however , higher than controls . Interestingly pAKT , a pro-survival factor , is increased by 50 % only in DM1-E3 cells but not in DM1-E2 and cDM1-E4 lines Figure 4d1 and d2 .40 To establish the relevance of apoptotic process , 10-day DM1 myotubes were treated for 5 days with 50 mM Z-VAD , a pancaspase inhibitor . The treatment produced a visual decrease in atrophic DM1 myotubes Figure 5a , a significant 23 % increase in number of myonuclei Figure 5b and a 26 % rise of average myotube width AMW Figure 5c in DM1-E2 and DM1-E4 myotubes compared to the untreated . Overall , these data provided evidence that apoptosis actively contributed to the observed catabolic pathways . The alter ego of apoptosis is the autophagic system , which is the vehicle for delivering proteins and organelles to the lysosome.41 The modern view considers autophagy as a pro-survival system that keeps the cell clear of toxic proteins and damaged organelles . However , excessive autophagy con-tributes to protein breakdown and muscle atrophy in skeletal muscle42,43 and to cell death in mononucleated cells . In view of this relationship with apoptosis and muscle loss , we studied the level of autophagy activation in control and DM1 myotubes . LC3-positive vesicles , a marker of activated autophagy , 41 were significantly increased in DM1-E2 , -E3 and -E4 myotubes at T15 compared with controls the quantification is repre-sented in the graph as number of LC3-positive vesicles mm2 Figure 6a1 and a2 . Instead , P62 showed no substantial changes among the various groups Figure 6b1 and b2 . It is interesting to note that the DM1-E3 lines which showed the lowest levels of apoptosis and no ROS production present the highest levels of autophagy , giving rise to a similar apoptosis effect , that is degeneration of 15-day myotubes . Discussion Myogenic potency in DM1 . This study clearly shows that primary muscular satellite cells from DM1 patients with either congenital or adult form have normal fusion , differentiation and maturation capacity . When we studied the myogenic capacity we found that the number of syncytial nuclei , the expression level of myogenic markers CK-M , myogenin and MHC and the contractile capability after innervation were similar to controls and unaffected by the number of CTG n repeats . We excluded an in vitro selection toward low CTG n repeats , as CTG expansion was confirmed at RNA level by n the presence of ribonuclear foci , the pathological hallmark of DM1 , which was always found in undifferentiated data not shown , differentiated and innervated DM1 muscle cells . In vivo , the retention into ribonuclear foci of the expanded DMPK transcript is associated with the misregulation of alternative splicing . This in trans effect on the alternative splicing of many RNAs , which does not result in the production of mutant protein but leads to expression of spliced products inappropriate for a particular tissue , is the major molecular defect identified in DM1.1,6 We provide evidence that splicing unbalance is present in undifferentiated and differentiated DM1 muscle cells . Moreover , similarly to what is observed in vivo , 8 also in vitro there is a correlation between the extend of the CTG repeat size and the degree of abnormal splicing . Differentiation capacity of primary human DM1 muscle cells is controversial . Normally-differentiated human myotubes were reported in calcium homeostasis studies from a large cohort of 15 adult DM1 patients20�22 and recently in 5 DM2 patients.23 Moreover , in vitro successfully innervated muscle fibers from 17 adult DM1 patients were used for studies of electrophysiological properties of DM1 mature myotubes28 and developmental regulation of DMPK.29,30 In contrast , other reports claim an impaired myogenesis26,31 or a delayed maturation of primary myotubes from three cDM1 and few adult DM1-DM2 patients.24,27 In addition , a large number of publications describe myogenic alterations in mouse muscle models13�17 or in primary DM1 fibroblasts converted in myoblasts by MyoD transfection.18,19 The delayed muscle development has been proposed as being determined by dysfunction of the signaling pathway that includes MyoD , Myf5 , MRF4 factors responsible for the commitment of muscle stem cells to the myogenic lineage , and myogenin and MFR4 , factors involved in the expression of the terminal muscle phenotype . It was found that the levels of the commitment factor MyoD were reduced both in C2C12 cells expressing mutant DMPK 30-UTR RNA and in DM1 patient myoblasts.15,26 However , this reduction of MyoD protein levels was not accompanied by a decrease in its homologue Myf5 . Moreover , Timchenko et al.26 proposed that myoblasts from one DM1 and one DM2 patients failed to undergo differentiation because of an impairment of the p21 CDK4 Rb E2F pathway usually essential for the withdrawal from cell cycle . A recent publication proposed32 that the ectopic expression of cyclin D3 corrects differentiation in DM1 myoblasts by increasing the CUGBP1�eIF2 interaction necessary for activation of the myogenic program and the correct expression of myogenic markers such as myogenin . The discordance between our results showing a normal DM1 primary myoblast differentiation and the reported alteration in the myogenic process of DM1 myoblasts might be accounted for by the different models used i.e. myoblasts from human adult versus fibroblasts converted into myoblasts and mouse model or by a difference in the morphological and clinical severity of the disease i.e. myoblasts from human cDM1 patients that survived after the neonatal period versus myoblasts from aborted cDM1 fetuses or by a difference in the age of the satellite cells , which may also influence myogenesis44 because of the recently reported implication of the p16 premature senescence of DM1 myoblasts.45,46 Catabolic pathways and a novel pathogenetic mechanism . During differentiation , myoblasts undergo sequential events , ending with fusion into syncytial cells , a cell type more resistant to sublethal damage than proliferating myoblasts , which go on to generate muscle fibers . However , in many degenerative and metabolic diseases , muscle fibers die with no marked inflammatory response , this could probably be due to apoptosis.47 Therefore , the study of myotubes in vitro is a good model for predicting if apoptosis is active at least in developing myofibers . Apoptosis in primary myotubes was evident in merosin , dystrophin and dystrophin-associated protein-deficient cell lines.48,49 Recently , Ullrich congenital dystrophy , caused by collagen-VI mutations , presented an increased occurrence of spontaneous apoptosis.50,51 At 15 days of culture , we observed a statistically significant decrease in the number of myonuclei in DM1 patients and concomitant evidences of atrophy . It has been reported that ubiquitin-proteasome , autophagy-lysosome and caspase-3 9 activation contribute , albeit to a different extent , to muscle loss . Indeed , we found an increase in apoptosis and autophagy even though no induction of atrophy-related genes , atrogin-1 and MuRF1 , was observed in any of the 15-day-differentiated DM1 myotubes however , it could not be excluded that these ubiquitin-ligases might contribute to myotube atrophy between 10 and 15 days . It is interesting to note that the reduced incidence of apoptosis in DM1-E3 cells matches with a concomitant significant increase of autophagy and of AKT activation . This trend can be explained in terms of the well-known inverse relationship found between the pro-cell death system , apoptosis and the pro-survival system autophagy.41 In our DM1 myotubes , apoptosis occurred after differentiation and not in undifferentiated myoblasts . The role of apoptosis was confirmed by Z-VAD treatment , which significantly recovered the number of myonuclei and AMW , so identifying apoptosis as a potential candidate for ther-apeutic approaches Figure 5 . A novel pathogenetic mechanism is emerging from our findings . It is important to underline that activation of autophagy matches with the CTG expansion , autophagy being highly activated in samples with high numbers of CTG Figure 6a . This correlation is consistent with the hypothesis that autophagy is induced to clear toxic proteins and organelles to maintain cell viability . Thus , autophagy may act as a pro-survival system , which can also reduce muscle mass as a result of to its proteolytic activity . Increasing the number of CTG triplets can affect the expression of critical factors for protein-folding processes , response to protein unfolding misfolding and many other cellular components including proteins involved in Ca2 ? homeostasis . Thus autophagy failure or exhaustion can lead to accumulation of toxic proteins , which can interfere with organelle mitochon-dria function and with cellular signaling leading to myofiber degeneration . It should be noted that we found an increase in H2O2 production in15-day-differentiated DM1-E2 and cDM1-E4 myotubes , which showed higher level of apoptosis and lower level of autophagy . As one of the main sources of ROS is dysfunctional mitochondria , the presence of H2O2 suggests a failure in the removal system for altered mitochondria . The persistence of abnormal mitochondria would induce the release of pro-apoptotic factors . Therefore , a failure or overload of autophagy induces accumulation of death-signaling compo-nents , which triggers apoptosis and myofiber degeneration . This hypothesis is in line with the established fact that autophagy and apoptosis are mutually exclusive and not synergistic . In conclusion , this is the first study focused on the differentiation of myoblasts from patients with adult classical DM1 and cDM1 that survived at the perinatal crisis , and allows us to formulate a new hypothesis to explain the progressive DM1 muscular pathogenesis . We propose that apoptosis�autophagy is the key event , probably coupled to oxidative stress and misregulation of calcium homeostasis , which may also be linked to premature senescence of satellite cells . n Materials and Methods Clinical data .

20431601	Cancer is often the result of a complex paradigm of genetic and epigenetic alterations that results in dysregulated intracellular signaling pathways . The complex and hetero-geneous mixture of cells that comprise the tumor mass often limit efficacy of conventional chemotherapy because of intrinsic or acquired drug resistance1 or suppression of apoptosis.2 Engagement of the apoptotic pathway by modulating pro-apoptotic factors has been proposed as an alternative strategy to trigger cancer cell death.3,4 At least two major signaling pathways exist in the induction of apoptosis . The intrinsic cell death pathway involves the permeabilization of mitochondria , resulting in release of pro-apoptotic factors such as cytochrome c and Smac Diablo5�7 into the cytosol , in which cytochrome c initiates apoptosome formation and activation of caspase-9 whereas second mitochondria-derived activator of caspase Smac relieves the inhibition of caspase by the inhibitors of apoptosis proteins IAPs . The second apoptotic pathway or extrinsic pathway is initiated through the binding of tumor necrosis factor TNF superfamily proteins to their respective cell surface receptors , leading to the activation of caspase-8.8 Activated caspase-8 and caspase-9 cleave and activate downstream caspases , including caspases 3 and 7 , which then subsequently cleave their cellular substrates , resulting in apoptosis . To develop a therapy targeted at abnormalities of apoptosis that have developed in cancer cells , mimetics of Smac were www.nature.com cdd developed as small-molecule antagonists of IAP function to help initiate cancer cell death . Li et al.9 first described the efficacy of a dimeric Smac mimetic compound 3 to potentiate TRAIL and TNF-mediated cancer cell death . Later on , others have developed similar �smac mimetic� approaches showing activity in various cancer lines.10�13 Similar to the endogenous Smac protein , Smac mimetics have been shown to compete with caspases for the binding of X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein XIAP and thereby release the inhibition on caspases imposed by XIAP.9 In addition , Smac protein and Smac mimetics induce the proteasomal degradation of cellular inhibitors of apoptosis cIAPs 12�14 that promote the release of receptor interacting protein 1 RIP1 from the TNFRI complex , leading to the formation of RIP1-dependent caspase-8 activation complex.14,15 In addition , loss of cIAP facilitates the stabilization of NIK , promoting IKK-a IKK-a activation and NF-kB2 p100 processing to p52.12,13 The noncanonical nuclear factor k-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cell NF-kB -driven pathway upregulates specific target genes , including TNF-a that is required , in conjunction with neutralization of XIAP , for Smac mimetic-induced cell death.12�16 As Smac mimetics enter clinical trials , it is critical to understand their mode of action as single agents or in combination with conventional chemotherapy to select appro-priate patients or treatment regimens . With this intent , a series of cellular and pharmacological studies were used to address their clinical utility . In this study we show that the ability of a small , dimeric Smac mimetic , JP1400 , to synergize with conventional cytotoxic agents is dependent on the production of TNF-a . Mechanistically , cell death is achieved through a multifaceted process including the inhibition of cellular proliferation and concomitant induction of TNF-a to provide a positive feedback loop , amplifying the TNF receptor�RIP1-dependent cell death pathway . Lastly , we provide novel evidence that in vivo treatment of xenograft tumors by Smac mimetics alone or in combination with chemotherapeutics is at least partially dependent on autocrine TNF-a . Results Biochemical activity of dimeric Smac mimetic , JP1400 . A small-molecular-weight dimeric Smac mimetic , JP1400 , was synthesized and its biochemical activity was compared with JP1010 , also known as compound 3 by Li et al.9 Figure 1a . Both JP1010 and JP1400 induced Ph S degradation of cIAP1 , whereas JP1400 showed superior degradation of cIAP2 over JP1010 Figure 1b . In a caspase de-repression assay , JP1400 was slightly better than JP1010 in relieving XIAP-mediated caspase-3 and -9 inhibitions Figures 1c and d . Given the improved cIAP2 activity of JP1400 , it was selected for further studies . Effects of JP1400 chemotherapy agent combinations in a variety of tumor cell lines . A screen of 50 non-small cell lung cancer cell NSCLC lines revealed that only 10�20 % of NSCLC lines tested were sensitive to Smac mimetics as a single agent.15 This low response rate could limit the usage of Smac mimetics as cancer therapeutics . We asked whether co-treatment with standard chemotherapy agents could render sensitivity to JP1400 in these Smac mimetic single-agent-resistant cells . In all , 10 different cancer cell lines , which are not sensitive to JP1400 single-agent treatment , were chosen for this purpose . The synergy between JP1400 and six chemotherapy agents , including gemcitabine , cisplatin , SN38 , paclitaxel , 5-fluorouracil 5-FU and nM nM nM nM nM nM PBS nM nM nM nM 100 100 10 30 10 30 1 3 1 3 nM nM nM nM nM nM PBS nM nM nM nM 100 100 10 30 10 30 1 3 1 3 etoposide , was tested . IC50�s were decreased by at least threefold in the presence of 100 nM JP1400 for at least two of the six drugs in the following five cell lines A2058 , MDA-MB435 , HT-29 , Miapaca-2 and Panc-1 Table 1 . The cell death response in A2058 cells are shown as examples in Supplementary Figure S1 . For future reference , these lines were labeled as �sensitive� whereas the remaining five cell lines were labeled as �resistant� . Chemotherapy agents , but not JP1400 , inhibit cell proliferation . To investigate the mechanism by which the chemotherapy agent Smac mimetic combination induced cell death , cell viability and proliferation assays were performed . JP1400 slightly increased A2058 cell BrdU incorporation , whereas TNF-a had almost no effect on BrdU incorporation , suggesting that neither inhibits cell proliferation Figure 2a . The combination of TNF-a and JP1400 decreased BrdU incorporation . However , this effect was blocked by the addition of a pan caspase inhibitor , z-VAD , suggesting that the lower level of BrdU incorporation in these cells was likely because of apoptotic cell death and not antiproliferative effects . This is consistent with its effect on cell survival Figure 2b . On the other hand , gemcitabine alone was solely responsible for the antiproliferative effects of the chemotherapeutics JP1400 combination Figure 2a . This observation is not unique to gemcitabine as etoposide , SN38 , 5-FU , cisplatin and paclitaxel also blocked incorporation of BrdU in a dose-dependent manner , irrespective of the presence or absence of z-VAD Figure 2c and Supplementary Figure S2 . Chemotherapeutics enhance JP1400-mediated caspase-3 cleavage . The apoptotic dependence of caspase activation for the chemotherapy agent JP1400 combinations was examined in greater detail with western blots for caspase-3 cleavage . Dose titrations of gemcitabine or etoposide alone had no effect on the cleavage of pro-caspase-3 at 4 h Figure 2d . Evidence of cleaved caspase-3 in combination with JP1400 revealed that this effect was entirely Smac mimetic dependent , as treatment of cells with JP1400 alone produced the same effect . As genotoxics generally require longer periods of time to initiate apoptosis , 17 we also examined caspase cleavage at 24 h . In combination with JP1400 , gemcitabine and etoposide induced a dose-dependent increase of caspase-3 cleavage that was substantially higher than treatment with JP1400 alone . This combination effect was also observed for cisplatin and SN38 Supplementary Figure S3a , and in another JP1400 chemotherapy agent sensitive cell line , HT-29 cells Supplementary Figures S3b and c . With the exception of cisplatin at 100 mM , none of the chemodrugs alone induced significant caspase-3 activation , arguing against a direct mitochondrial role for the enhanced caspase activation by the chemodrugs . These data show that chemotherapy in combination with Smac mimetics can indeed enhance the Smac mimetic-induced apoptotic pathway to increase and accelerate cell death . Chemotherapy JP1400 synergism is dependent on autocrine TNF-a RIP1 pathway . It has been previously shown that the molecular mechanism inherent in variety with 50 of plates determined chemotherapy Pancreas Pancreas experiments . Origin Breast Breast Prostate 96-well Colon Lung Skin Skin Lung was in Rat 120 % z-VAD 140 % Cell Actin Actin single-agent Smac mimetic sensitivity is dependent upon the presence of autocrine TNF-a.12,13,15 Smac mimetics synergize with TNF-a to promote cell death through formation of a RIP1-dependent death-inducing complex.14,15 To investigate whether the chemotherapy agent JP1400-dependent cell death was also because of autocrine TNF-a and a RIP1-dependent signaling pathway , cell viability experiments were performed in the presence of neutralizing anti-TNF-a antibody or in the background of RIP1 siRNA-knockdown cells . Neutralizing TNF-a antibodies completely blocked the etoposide JP1400-or SN38 JP1400-induced cell death and partially blocked gemcitabine JP1400-or cisplatin JP1400-induced cell death , suggesting that auto-crine TNF-a is requisite for its cell killing abilities Figure 3a . This dependence on autocrine TNF-a was also observed for the combination effect in other cell lines Supple-mentary Figure S4 , data not shown . In a similar manner , knockdown of RIP1 completely blocked the ability of all four chemotherapeutics to synergize with JP1400 and induce cell death Figures 3b and c . We next examined the effect of chemotherapy agents on RIP1-dependent caspase-8-activating complex formation . z-VAD was added to prevent the complex from falling apart.15 After 24 h of treatment , JP1400 alone induced significant amount of RIP1 FADD caspase-8 complex formation Figure 3d . Gemcitabine treatment alone had no effect but it enhanced JP1400-induced complex formation , suggesting that gemcitabine synergizes with Smac mimetic to activate autocrine-TNF-a signaling . Induction of TNF-a mRNA levels in response to JP1400 correlates with sensitivity to JP1400 chemotherapy agent combinations . It has been well established that Smac mimetic increases autocrine TNF-a production by inducing cIAP1 2 degradation , leading to the stabilization of NIK , and subsequently activation of noncanonical NF-kB pathway.12,13 To further solidify the necessity of TNF-a in chemotherapy JP1400-induced cell death , the panel of cell lines used in Table 1 was tested for their ability to induce TNF-a mRNA expression in response to JP1400 . After 4 h of treatment , cell lines that showed sensitivity to the chemotherapy agent JP1400 combination showed three-to eightfold induction of TNF-a over untreated cells , whereas �resistant� cells showed less than twofold induction Figure 4a . In contrast , mRNA levels of cIAP2 , another NF-kB target gene , were induced fourfold or more in 9 of 10 cell lines tested Figure 4b . Chemotherapy agents such as gemcitabine and cisplatin activate the ATM ATR DNA-damage signaling pathways leading to ubiquitinylation of IKK-g NEMO . This in turn releases the IKK-a IKK-b complex and stimulates the cano-nical NF-kB pathway through degradation of IkB-a and subsequent nuclear translocation of p65 and Rel A proteins.18 Indeed , A2058 cells showed decreased IkB-a levels and increased levels of NF-kB p65 in the nucleus after a 24-h treatment with gemcitabine Figures 4c and d . Consistently , gemcitabine was able to induce TNF-a mRNA levels by 27-fold , which was inhibited by pretreatment of cells with an IKK inhibitor Figure 4e . Similar results were obtained with the other chemotherapeutics data not shown . To investigate whether chemotherapeutics could enhance Smac mimetic-induced TNF-a production , A2058 cells were treated with gemcitabine , etoposide , SN38 or cisplatin in the presence or absence of 100 nM JP1400 . z-VAD was also added to prevent cell death . At 24 h , there was substantial induction of TNF-a by all chemotherapy agents alone , and an even greater synergistic induction was observed in the presence of JP1400 . For instance , gemcitabine treatment led to a B60-fold induction of TNF-a mRNA , whereas co-treatment with JP1400 boosted that level to over 130-fold Figure 4f . cIAP2 expression was also induced in a similar manner , but to a lesser degree Figure 4g . z-VAD alone had no affect on TNF-a or cIAP2 expression data not shown . To determine whether TNF-a protein levels correlated with the observed increase in TNF-a mRNA levels , a TNF-a ELISA was used to measure the secreted TNF-a levels in the conditioned cell culture medium . A2058 cells treated with JP1400 led to a twofold increase in TNF-a , whereas gemcitabine and the gemcitabine JP1400 combination produced fourfold and sixfold higher levels of TNF-a , respectively Supplementary Induction 4 Fold 0 G361 PC3 BT474 HT29 Miapaca A2058 Panc1 NCI-H460 NCI-H226 MDA-M435 I ? B Actin 2 Fold 0 G361 PC3 BT474 HT29 Miapaca A2058 Panc1 NCI-H460 NCI-H226 MDA-M435 Gem Fold 10 Figure S5a . On the other hand , A2058 cells have low endogenous cIAP2 protein levels and it is completely eliminated by JP1400 at 24 h regardless of whether gemcita-bine is present Supplementary Figure S5b . Autocrine TNF-a contributes to JP1400-induced tumor regression in human tumor xenograft models . Although a 130-fold induction of TNF-a mRNA levels is impressive , these results and those by others have been limited to in vitro systems . To analyze whether Smac mimetic induces tumor autocrine TNF-a production in vivo , we used HCC461 cells , a Smac mimetic single-agent sensitive cell line , in a xenograft model.15 Nude mice carrying HCC461 tumors were treated with one single intravenous injection of saline vehicle or 3 mg kg JP1400 . At 6 h after injection , human TNF-a levels in the plasma were measured through a human-specific TNF-a ELISA Figure 5a . Mice treated with JP1400 had significant levels of hTNF-a in the circulating plasma , suggesting that in a remarkably short amount of time , Smac mimetics penetrate tumor tissue and trigger the production of TNF-a . Similarly , when human TNF-a and cIAP2 mRNA levels were evaluated in the excised tumors of HCC461 xenograft mice , we observed an induction of 65-fold and 20-fold , respectively Po0.0001 Figure 5b . These results suggested that the in vivo tumor mimicked our observations in vitro . To provide conclusive evidence for whether TNF-a is required for Smac mimetic sensitivity of whole tumors , HCC461 xenograft mice were i.p. injected five times with 5 mg kg of the soluble TNF receptor , etanercept . Mice were also i.v . injected at day 13 with 1 mg kg JP1400 . At day 22 , saline or etanercept-treated mice had 41000 mg tumors whereas tumors in JP1400-treated mice were only approximately B200 mg Figures 5c and d . Etanercept was only able to partially block JP1400-induced tumor cell killing with an average tumor weight of 431 mg at day 22 P ? 0.007 . To ensure that the xenograft response was not unique to HCC461 tumors and that the observations could be translated to combination treatments , an additional cancer cell line , Miapaca-2 , was also tested in a xenograft model . Gemcitabine had no effect on tumor cell growth whereas JP1400 alone limited tumor growth to 308 mg compared with 721 mg for saline control P ? 0.004 Figures 6a and c . This JP1400 single-agent effect was rather unexpected as JP1400 had minimal effect on Miapaca-2 cells in vitro Supplementary Figure S6a . The combination of gemcitabine and JP1400 resulted in a twofold decrease in tumor size compared with JP1400 alone P ? 0.03 , consistent with the in vitro combination effect Supplementary Figure S6b . Similar to that observed in HCC461 model , treatment of Miapaca-2 xenograft mice with etanercept partially blocked gemcitabine plus JP1400-induced tumor killing P ? 0.002 Figures 6b and c . It has been proven that the ability of Smac mimetic to bind XIAP , which releases its inhibition on caspases , as well as to induce cIAP degradation through proteasomal pathway , are both essential for its cell killing activities12�16 Figure 6d . However , these anti-IAP functions can not be used to predict the cell death response , because in all cell lines tested , regardless of their cell death response , Smac mimetic binds to XIAP and induces cIAP degradation data not shown . There are two cellular events that result from cIAP degradation 1 activation of the noncanonical NF-kB pathway and subsequently increased production of autocrine TNF-a and 2 release of RIP1 from the TNF-a receptor complex , leading to caspase-8 activation , which requires TNF-a receptor to be activated in the first place . Accumulating evidence suggest that whether or not Smac mimetic induces autocrine TNF-a production is the key factor in deciding the cell�s fate upon Smac mimetic treatment . Depending on their response to Smac mimetics , cells can be grouped into three general classes in class I cells , Smac mimetic induces autocrine 900 3 800 mm 700 600 Size 500 400 900 3 800 mm 700 600 Size 500 400 TNF-a production and massive cell loss 12,13,15 in class II cells , Smac mimetic still induces autocrine TNF-a production but this does not have a major effect on the cell population and in class III cells , Smac mimetic has no effect on autocrine TNF-a production or on cell death . The ability of cells to produce TNF-a is necessary but not sufficient for Smac mimetic to induce cell death as a single agent . In class II cells , although autocrine-TNF-a production , RIP1-dependent caspase-8 complex formation and caspase-3 activation were induced by Smac mimetics , only marginal cell death was detected in these cells . As Smac mimetic TNF-a signaling does not inhibit the cell cycle , it is critical that the cell death signal is strong enough to ensure massive cell death . Otherwise the surviving cells could continue to grow and compensate for the cell loss . Consistent with this notion , Smac mimetic does slightly enhance the cell proliferation rate , which was partially blocked in the presence of z-VAD Figure 2 , suggesting that the increased cell growth may in part be a consequence of Smac mimetic-induced caspase activation and cell death . The mechanism behind this phenomenon warrants further investigation . The extent of autocrine TNF-a induction and the relative levels of pro-apoptotic versus antiapoptotic proteins in different cells may distinguish class I versus class II cells . Use of Smac mimetics in combination with chemotherapy agents could convert at least some of the class II cells into sensitive cells . Enhanced Smac mimetic cell killing in combination with standard chemotherapeutics relies heavily on their ability to 1 inhibit cellular proliferation and 2 activate the canonical NF-kB pathway to exacerbate the production of TNF-a , thus enhancing the extrinsic cell death pathway Figure 6d . Surprisingly , the mitochondria-depen-dent , intrinsic apoptotic pathway initiated by genotoxics seems to be less important in this combination effect . Pretreatment of cells with either anti-TNF-a antibodies or RIP1 siRNA almost completely blocked Smac mimetic chemotherapy agent-induced cell death . Both extrinsic and intrinsic determinants are critical for cancer cell survival and death.19 Moreover , it has been suggested that all cancer cells have the capability to undergo apoptosis , but are prevented from doing so by signals from both neighboring cells and the tumor microenvironment.20 The observation that chemotherapeutics can greatly enhance the level of TNF-a production in combination with Smac mimetics has many promising possibilities in itself . Strong induction of TNF-a localized to the tumor could mimic immunotherapy-based studies that show that high localized TNF-a reduces blood flow and causes tumor vasculature damage.21 TNF-a may also modulate the immune response within the tumor by stimulating macrophage and NK cell activity . Synthesis of TNF-a by inflammatory cells in grade III invasive breast cancer patients correlated with fewer cases of recurrence and metastasis.22 On the other hand , it is unclear how much TNF-a is required to overcome the survival threshold and induce apoptosis . Different from Smac mimetic , which induces TNF-a production through activation of the noncanonical NF-kB pathway , 12,13 chemotherapeutics can activate the canonical NF-kB pathway to enhance TNF-a production and death receptor-induced cell death . The ability of cells to produce TNF-a , but not cIAP2 , in response to JP1400 correlates very well with its sensitivity to JP1400 chemotherapy combination . Understanding the mechanism of this differential response could provide a predictive biomarker for Smac mimetic therapy . We have found that for all cell lines tested , Smac mimetics clearly induce cIAP degradation and subsequent processing of NF-kB p100 data not shown . Thus , the NF-kB nuclear translocation , the post-translational modifications of NF-kB including acetylation and phosphorylation , or epigenetic modifications and chromatin structure of the target gene promoter are more likely to determine the specific gene response in different cell lines . This question continues to provide an exciting area of future research in the use of Smac mimetics . It is noteworthy that the Miapaca-2 cell line used in these studies is not sensitive to Smac mimetics alone in vitro , yet becomes sensitized to JP1400 in in vivo tumor xenograft models . Autocrine paracrine TNF-a could be highly concen-trated in the compact tumor microenvironment , which may lead to the enhanced Smac mimetic activity in vivo . Alternatively , the tumor microenvironment is complex and there might be other factors that contribute to Smac mimetic-induced cell death in tumors that are not recapitulated in cell culture systems . This finding highlights the potential that many more tumors might be sensitive to Smac mimetics as a single agent in vivo . The observation that the mechanism of action of Smac mimetics alone or in combination with chemotherapy agents , in xenograft models , is at least partially dependent upon autocrine TNF-a is to the best of our knowledge the first documented report . Why the soluble TNF receptor , etaner-cept , was not able to fully block Smac mimetic or Smac mimetic gemcitabine-induced tumor cell killing is not fully clear , but it may in fact be a result of the inability of etanercept to penetrate compact tumors . In addition , the compact tumor cell environment may lead to quick engagement of newly synthesized TNF-a with its receptor in an autocrine or paracrine manner , even before etanercept has had a chance to neutralize its action . Alternatively , etanercept is reported to preferentially bind soluble TNF-a over membrane-bound TNF-a.23 Again , in a compact tumor microenvironment , cleavage of soluble TNF-a may not be necessary as membrane-bound TNF-a could directly bind and engage neighboring TNF receptors . On the other hand , it is not clear and also difficult to determine the pharmacokinetics of etanercept in the animal body and how this relates to its ability to counteract all the autocrine TNF-a action induced by Smac mimetic . Lastly , we can not rule out the possibility that other factors may have a critical role in Smac mimetic-induced cell death in vivo . Further in vivo studies are warranted to fully understand the mechanistic and clinical effect of Smac mimetic-induced tumor regression and cell killing . The above results suggest that combination therapy of conventional chemotherapeutics in conjugation with a small-molecule Smac mimetic offers a promising strategy for the treatment of cancer . The efficacy of such treatments will be , in part , dependent upon intrinsic TNF-a levels or the ability of the Smac mimetic chemotherapy combination to induce TNF-a , providing a potential predictive and clinically measurable biomarker .

20431602	O Kutuk1 and A Letai* , 1 Paclitaxel is a chemotherapeutic drug effective against many human malignancies , including breast cancer . Similar to other taxanes , paclitaxel stabilizes microtubule dynamics , activates the spindle checkpoint , and triggers mitotic arrest at the G2 M phase followed by apoptosis.1 Apoptosis occurs either during mitotic arrest or after �slippage� out of arrest into the cell cycle . Bax Bak knockout MEFs are completely insensitive to paclitaxel treatment , indicating the fundamental function of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway in paclitaxel-induced cell death.2 Nevertheless , the signaling pathways that connect paclitaxel-induced microtubule perturbation to MOMP and cytochrome c release are not well characterized . The mitochondrial or intrinsic apoptotic pathway is used by most chemotherapeutic agents to kill cancer cells . The point of commitment to death in the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway is MOMP followed by the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondrial intermembrane space into cytosol.3 Once in the cytosol , cytochrome c induces the formation of a large multi-protein complex known as the apoptosome.4 The apoptosome facilitates the activation of caspases , cysteine proteases , which are important executors of the apoptotic process . MOMP is strictly controlled by Bcl-2 family proteins . Bax and Bak undergo an activating allosteric change and homo-oligomerize to form pores that cause MOMP . Bax and Bak are essential for mitochondrial apoptosis and prodeath function of BH3-only proteins.5�7 Bax and Bak are activated by activator proteins that include the BH3-only proteins Bim and Bid , and also members of the Bcl-2 family of proteins.5,8�11 Prosurvival Bcl-2 proteins Bcl-2 , Bcl-xL , Mcl-1 , Bcl-w , and Bfl-1 inhibit MOMP and cytosolic release of cytochrome c largely by sequestering activator BH3-only proteins Bid , Bim , and possibly Puma before they can activate Bax and Bak.5,9,10,12 Another group of BH3-only proteins called sensitizers , which lack the ability to directly activate Bax or Bak , exert their prodeath function by binding prosurvival Bcl-2 proteins to displace activator BH3-only proteins . Sensitizers include Bad , Noxa , Bik , Puma , and Bmf . In addition , BH3-only proteins may directly displace Bax and Bak from their antiapoptotic-binding partners to initiate prodeath signaling and to promote MOMP.13,14 It is clear that a complicated interplay among proapoptotic and antiapoptotic proteins is responsible for determining commitment to cell death from many perturbations . In this study , we sought to determine the components of paclitaxel-triggered mitochondrial proapoptotic signaling in breast cancer cells . We chose breast cancer cells because breast cancer is one of the leading indications for taxane therapy , yet the mechanism of killing is still poorly understood . Here , we report that paclitaxel activates the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway in breast cancer cells , in which Bim , Bmf , and Puma collaborate in a novel and complex mechanism involving the common final displacement of Bim from antiapoptotic proteins by Bmf and Puma . In contrast with most earlier described mechanisms of chemotherapy killing of cancer cells , this mechanism does not rely solely on changes in levels of proapoptotic proteins , but also in changes in their interaction partners . Results Paclitaxel kills MCF-7 breast cancer cells through the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway . We first tested whether paclitaxel killed breast cancer cells through the mitochondrial intrinsic apoptotic pathway . To evaluate the dose and time dependence of paclitaxel-induced apoptosis in MCF-7 cells , cells were examined after 48 h treatment with increasing doses of paclitaxel 0�100 nM using Annexin V staining Figure 1a . Apoptosis induction by paclitaxel 100 nM was time dependent , evident by 12 , 24 , and 48 h after treatment . Release of cytochrome c from the mitochondrial intermembrane space to the cytosol is an important characteristic of mitochondrial apoptosis . Treatment of MCF-7 cells with 100 nM paclitaxel triggered the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria into cytosol significantly at 12 h after treatment Figure 1b . When MOMP is induced cells 90 through the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway controlled by the Bcl-2 family of proteins , the multi-domain proapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins Bax and Bak undergo an allosteric change that exposes an N-terminal epitope , which is accompanied by the formation of oligomers on mitochondrial membrane to initiate the release of cytochrome c . In paclitaxel-treated MCF-7 cells , activation of Bax and Bak was shown by immunoprecipitation with antibodies recognizing the exposed N-terminal epitope as early as 8 h after paclitaxel treatment Figure 1c . Caspase-8 activation is a hallmark of signaling through the extrinsic , or death receptor , apoptotic pathway . Caspase-9 activation , on the other hand , is a hallmark of killing through the intrinsic , or mitochondrial , cell death pathway . We found that cleavage of caspase-9 , but not caspase-8 , was detected in paclitaxel-treated cells by immunoblotting Supplementary Figure S1a . Pretreatment of MCF-7 cells with a pancaspase inhibitor and a caspase-9 inhibitor , but not a caspase-8 inhibitor , significantly prevented paclitaxel-induced apoptosis Supplementary Figure S1a . Selective activation of and dependence on caspase-9 rather than caspase-8 suggests that paclitaxel activates the intrinsic mitochondrial rather than the extrinsic apoptotic pathway.4,15,16 The activation of Bax and Bak , release of cytochrome c , and dependence on caspase-9 all suggest that death from paclitaxel occurs through the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway . As Bcl-2 protein family members are major regulators of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway , we examined the expres-sion of Bcl-2 family proteins in response to paclitaxel treatment . As shown in Figure 1d , with the exception of an increase in Bax protein , the other proteins examined are relatively stable through 24 h of treatment . Only at 48 h , a decrease in Bcl-xL , Bim , and Bmf levels is observed . Given how late this occurs , the decreases are likely due to events such as decreased production or increased proteolysis after commitment to apoptosis . There were no substantial altera-tions of Bcl-2 , Mcl-1 , Bak , Noxa , and Puma protein levels in response to paclitaxel treatment . There are no , therefore , widespread changes in the levels of Bcl-2 family proteins observed before commitment to apoptosis after treatment with paclitaxel . Bim is an activator BH3-only protein , which has been reported to act as a tumor suppressor and to be essential for apoptosis induction by a number of stimuli such as chemotherapy , irradiation , or growth factor withdrawal.17�19 In particular , paclitaxel was shown to cause increased Bim levels in baby mouse kidney cells.20 Indeed , in all of these reports , prodeath stimuli were found to kill by increasing Bim levels by either transcriptional or posttranslational mechan-isms . However , paclitaxel treatment did not increase Bim protein levels in our experiments , suggesting that breast cancer cell line MCF-7 was killed through a novel mechanism Figure 1d . Paclitaxel treatment induces Bmf Bcl-2 heterodimeriz-ation and disrupts Bim Bcl-2 interaction . We have found that displacement of Bim from Bcl-2 can cause apoptosis in other systems.21,22 Therefore , we tested whether paclitaxel treatment induced a change in Bim binding by antiapoptotic proteins that correlated with apoptotic response . As shown in Figure 2a , although a substantial amount of Bim is bound by Bcl-2 before treatment , treatment with 100 nM paclitaxel for 12 h causes dissociation of the Bim Bcl-2 complex . Note that Bim was also bound by Bcl-xL and Mcl-1 in untreated cells , but these interactions were not significantly altered by paclitaxel treatment Figure 2a . All interactions were verified by reciprocal immunoprecipitation experiments . We also monitored the time course of Bim Bcl-xL and Bim Mcl-1 interactions after treatment with paclitaxel and our results did not reveal substantial changes except for slightly increased BimL and BimS interactions with Mcl-1 and Bcl-xL Supplementary Figure S2a . An important question , therefore , is whether treatment with taxol increases the amount of �free� Bim unbound by antiapoptotic proteins . We found that more than half of the cellular Bim was bound to Bcl-2 , Bcl-xL , and Mcl-1 in MCF-7 cells before treatment , and an increase in unbound Bim levels could be detected after treatment with paclitaxel Supplementary Figure S2b . Moreover , most of Bim was localized to heavy membrane HM or light membrane LM fractions in MCF-7 cells and the subcellular localization of Bim was not altered after paclitaxel treatment Supplementary Figure S2b . As paclitaxel induced displacement of Bim from Bcl-2 , we hypothesized that another protein s might be binding Bcl-2 to displace Bim . In Bcl-2-overexpressing MCF-7 cells , we tested whether paclitaxel treatment induced binding of BH3-only proteins Puma , Bad , or Bmf , or multi-domain proapoptotic Bax or Bak to Bcl-2 . We found that only Bmf increased its interaction with Bcl-2 Supplementary Figure S2c . Bmf is reported to be regulated through its interaction with myosin V motor complexes and activated and released from its association with dynein light chain 2 DLC2 in response to anoikis.23 We next tested whether the pattern of Bmf binding to antiapoptotic proteins was consistent with a potential function as the agent displacing Bim in parental MCF-7 cells . In Figure 2b , we show that paclitaxel treatment induces a Bmf Bcl-2 interaction based on immunoprecipitation with a Bcl-2 antibody followed by immunoblotting for Bmf . This coimmunoprecipitation of Bmf with Bcl-2 was confirmed by reciprocal immunoprecipitation by a Bmf antibody and immunoblotting for Bcl-2 . In this reciprocal immunoprecipita-tion , Bmf Bcl-2 interaction was evident as early as 4 h of paclitaxel treatment . Moreover , levels of Bmf complexed to Bcl-xL were significantly decreased after paclitaxel treatment in parallel with increased Bmf Bcl-2 interaction . Mcl-1 did not interact with Bmf in either untreated or paclitaxel-treated cells results not shown . We also evaluated the interactions between antiapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins and Bax or Bak in response to paclitaxel treatment using coimmunoprecipitation experiments . We could not detect any Bax Bcl-2 , Bak Bcl-2 , Bak Bcl-xL , or Bax Mcl-1 interaction Supplementary Figure S2d . In contrast , our results showed Bax Bcl-xL interaction in MCF-7 cells , which was disrupted after paclitaxel treatment . Bak interacts weakly with Mcl-1 and this interaction was not altered by paclitaxel treatment Supplementary Figure S2d . Hence , it is plausible that Bax displaced from Bcl-xL can also contribute to paclitaxel-induced cell death in cooperation with Bim displaced from Bcl-2 . Our results suggest that paclitaxel-induced signaling in MCF-7 cells induces Bmf to leave a complex with Bcl-xL to bind to Bcl-2 , displacing Bim from Bcl-2 to activate the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway . If this is the case , loss of either Bim or Bmf should cause reduced killing by paclitaxel . To test our hypothesis , MCF-7 cells were transfected with Bim siRNA , Bmf siRNA , or a scrambled sequence siRNA . Reduction of Bim and Bmf levels in siRNA-treated cells was shown by immunoblotting . As seen in Figure 2c , both Bim and Bmf protein levels were efficiently reduced by their corre-sponding siRNA duplexes , and scrambled siRNAs did not have any notable effect . Loss of either Bim or Bmf significantly impaired the ability of paclitaxel to kill . This impairment was particularly prominent for Bim loss . The less complete rescue by Bmf leaves open the possibility that other molecules might also have a function in displacing Bim from Bcl-2 . Knockdown of Bim or Bmf also decreased the activation of Bax and Bak in response to paclitaxel treatment in MCF-7 cells , indicating that these BH3-only proteins act upstream of Bax and Bak activation as expected Figure 2d . In addition , we also tested whether small-molecule Bcl-2 inhibitor ABT-737 restores the sensitivity of MCF-7 cells to paclitaxel treatment after Bmf and Bim knockdown . ABT-737 treatment effectively rescued the loss of Bmf and to a lesser Actin Actin extent loss of Bim paclitaxel sensitivity , although ABT-737 itself did not show any significant effect when used alone at 100 nM Supplementary Figure S1b . In addition , ABT-737 did not induce further cell death in untransfected MCF-7 cells when combined with paclitaxel , which could be due to already efficiently engaged prodeath signaling by paclitaxel in these cells . If displacement of Bim is causing apoptosis , then loss of Bim should reduce sensitivity to peptides , which compete for Bim binding to antiapoptotic proteins . We tested this using BH3 profiling , a tool that measures mitochondrial dysfunction after treatment with peptides derived from BH3-only pro-teins.21,24 We compared mitochondrial dysfunction in re-sponse to BH3 peptides in MCF-7 cells with and without knockdown of Bim Figure 2e . Knockdown of Bim caused decreased sensitivity to peptides , consistent with the dis-placement of pre-existing Bim being the cause of mitochon-drial permeabilization . If Bmf is responsible for Bim displacement , then we would expect that the Bim Bcl-2 complex would be maintained even after paclitaxel treatment , if Bmf levels were reduced . In Figure 2f , we examine the levels of the Bim Bcl-2 complex before and after paclitaxel treatment , in the presence and absence of siRNA for Bmf . As expected , addition of paclitaxel causes loss of the Bim Bcl-2 complex compare lanes 1 and 2 . However , when Bmf is reduced with siRNA , the Bim Bcl-2 complex is largely maintained , suggesting that Bmf is necessary for the displacement of Bim from Bcl-2 after paclitaxel treatment compare lanes 2 and 4 . Note that similar results are obtained by reciprocal immunopreci-pitation and blotting of Bcl-2 and Bmf , or Bmf and Bcl-2 , respectively . On the other hand , depletion of endogenous Bad by siRNA did not have any effect on Bim Bcl-2 complex and Bim was displaced from Bcl-2 on paclitaxel treatment , consistent with the ability of Bad to promote MOMP in the absence of Bim in whole cell JC-1 assays Supplementary Figure S1c . Treatment of cells with scrambled siRNA did not have any effect . Our findings show that in the MCF-7 breast cancer cell line , paclitaxel treatment causes displacement of Bmf from Bcl-xL , which displaces Bim from Bcl-2 , followed by Bax and Bak activation and commitment to apoptosis . Paclitaxel kills other breast cancer cells through the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway . Above , we described a novel mechanism of serial displacement of pro-apoptotic proteins from antiapoptotic proteins that governs commitment to apoptosis in paclitaxel-treated MCF-7 cells . To explore whether paclitaxel activates a similar proapoptotic pathway in other breast cancer cells , we exposed T47D , MDA-MB-468 , and BT20 cells to increasing concentrations of paclitaxel for 48 h and 100 nM paclitaxel for 0�48 h . Using identical methods to those in Figures 1 and 2 for MCF-7 , we found that paclitaxel induced mitochondrial apoptosis at similar concentrations with similar kinetics in the T47D , MDA-MB-468 , and BT20 breast cancer cell lines Figure 3a . Cytochrome c was released from the mitochondria and Bax and Bak were activated with similar kinetics in all cases Supplementary Figures S3a�S3c , S4a�S4c . Treatment of breast cancer cells with paclitaxel for up to 48 h also revealed the activation of caspases-3 and -9 in breast cancer cells as assessed by immunoblot analysis of cleaved caspase fragments and fluorogenic caspase assays Supplementary Figure S1d�f . Moreover , paclitaxel-induced apoptosis was blocked by pretreating cells with pancaspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK and caspase-9 inhibitor Z-LEHD-FMK , but MDA-MB-468 50 50 Bim displacement from antiapoptotic proteins is critical for paclitaxel-induced apoptosis . As Bim displacement was so important in paclitaxel-mediated killing of MCF-7 cells , we also investigated the interaction of Bim with antiapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins Bcl-2 , Bcl-xL , and Mcl-1 in response to paclitaxel 100 nM treatment for these other breast cancer cell lines . In Figure 4a , we show that Bim interacts with all three antiapoptotic proteins in untreated T47D cells , but the interaction with Bcl-xL is easiest to detect . Only Bim bound to Bcl-xL decreases after paclitaxel treatment in T47D cells . In MDA-MB-468 and BT20 cells , Bim was also found to be complexed to all three antiapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins . Paclitaxel treatment led to decreased levels of Bcl-2 Bim and Bcl-xL Bim complexes in these two cell not the caspase-8 inhibitor Z-IETD-FMK Supplementary Figure S1d�f . In all breast cancer cell lines studied , therefore , paclitaxel kills in a caspase-9-dependent manner using the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway . In T47D , MDA-MB-468 , and BT20 cells , we also examined the levels of Bcl-2 proteins in response to paclitaxel treatment for 0�48 h . Treatment with paclitaxel led to increased Puma and modestly increased Bim levels at 8�12 h and decreased Bcl-2 levels at 48 h of treatment in T47D cells . Notably , Bmf is undetectable by immunoblot analysis Figure 3b . In MDA-MB-468 cells , paclitaxel treatment resulted in increased Bcl-xL and Bmf levels , other Bcl-2 proteins were not altered Figure 3c . Paclitaxel treatment did not induce any significant change in Bcl-2 proteins in BT20 cells Figure 3d . BimEL Bcl-xL Bcl-xL Actin Bcl-xL Actin Bcl-2 Bcl-2 lines Figure 4b and c . Similar to MCF-7 and T47D cells , the Mcl-1 Bim interaction did not change on paclitaxel treatment in these cell lines Figure 4b and c . In common with MCF-7 cells , displacement of Bim from antiapoptotic proteins is a consistent event after paclitaxel treatment in all four breast cancer cell lines . To test whether Bim was again required for paclitaxel-induced apoptosis in these breast cancer cells , we treated cells with Bim siRNA or a scrambled sequence siRNA followed by paclitaxel treatment for 48 h . We confirmed the efficiency of Bim knockdown by immunoblot analysis . As shown in Figure 5a , knockdown of Bim in T47D , MDA-MB-468 , and BT20 cells efficiently blocked paclitaxel-induced apoptosis . In parallel to Annexin V staining , we also monitored the effect of Bim depletion on paclitaxel-induced activation of Bax and Bak in these cell lines . Our results show that depletion of Bim levels by siRNA-mediated knockdown consistently prevented paclitaxel-induced Bax and Bak activation Figure 5b . These results revealed the pivotal function of Bim upstream of Bax and Bak activation in paclitaxel-induced apoptosis . Bmf binds to Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL on paclitaxel treatment and is required for Bim displacement and cell death . To evaluate the involvement of Bmf in paclitaxel-induced apoptosis in MDA-MB-468 and BT20 cells , we initially monitored whether Bmf interacts with antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins in response to paclitaxel treatment for 0�12 h using coimmunoprecipitation experiments . As shown in Figure 6a , both Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL interact weakly with Bmf in untreated MDA-MB-468 cells , which was more clearly shown with reciprocal Bmf immunoprecipitation experiments . Dramatically increased Bmf Bcl-2 and Bmf Bcl-xL interactions in MDA-MB-468 were detected after 8 h of paclitaxel treatment . Similarly , paclitaxel treatment resulted in induction of Bmf Bcl-2 and Bmf Bcl-xL protein complexes in BT20 cells Figure 6b . In neither case was an interaction between Bmf and Mcl-1 detectable not shown . Note that this pattern of Bmf binding to Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL matches the displacement of Bim from the same proteins with the same kinetics . As increased Puma levels and decreased Bim Bcl-xL interaction were observed in T47D cells , we tested whether Puma can contribute to paclitaxel-induced Control Paclitaxel Bim siRNAScrambled siRNA Paclitaxel + Bim siRNA Paclitaxel + Scrambled siRNA apoptosis in this cell line . Thereby , we investigated the interaction of Puma with Bcl-xL in response to paclitaxel treatment for 12 h . In Figure 6c , we show that paclitaxel induces increased Bcl-xL-bound Puma levels , which was also evident in reciprocal immunoprecipitation experiments . We then tested the requirement for Bmf in paclitaxel-induced apoptosis in MDA-MB-468 and BT20 cells by using siRNA-mediated knockdown of Bmf . Pretreatment of MDA-MB-468 and BT20 cells with Bmf siRNA significantly decreased paclitaxel-induced apoptosis after 48 h of pacli-taxel treatment Figure 6d . Of note , this effect was more profound in BT20 cells in which the knockdown was more efficient . As a negative control , Bmf siRNA had no effect on paclitaxel killing of T47D cells , which do not express Bmf data not shown . In contrast , knockdown of Puma in T47D cells significantly decreased paclitaxel-induced apoptosis , sug-gesting the involvement of Puma in paclitaxel-induced proapoptotic signaling in T47D cells . Treatment of cells with scrambled siRNA did not have any effect on paclitaxel-induced cell death in all three cell lines . Of note , depletion of MDA-MB-468 Control Paclitaxel Bim siRNAScrambled siRNA Paclitaxel + Bim siRNA Paclitaxel + Scrambled siRNA Puma by RNA interference did not alter the apoptotic response by paclitaxel in MDA-MB-468 , BT20 , and MCF-7 cells Supplementary Figure S5a�c . In agreement with the inhibitory effect of Bmf knockdown on apoptotic response , activation of Bax and Bak after 12 h of paclitaxel treatment was also suppressed when we depleted Bmf by siRNA in MDA-MB-468 and BT20 cells Figure 6e . To test whether Bmf is capable of displacing Bim from Bcl-2 , we used fluorescence polarization assays using FITC-labeled Bim BH3 and Bmf BH3 peptides . Unlabeled Bim and Bmf BH3 peptides were titrated to compete with the binding of FITC-labeled BH3 peptides as depicted by loss of fluorescence polarization . Our data showed that both Bim and Bmf were capable of displacing each other from Bcl-2 with similar efficiencies Figure 6f . As we showed that depletion of Bmf in MCF-7 cells led to decreased displacement of Bim from Bcl-2 Figure 2f , we tested whether a similar mechanism was also active in MDA-MB-468 and BT20 cells . To address this question , we incubated cells with paclitaxel for 12 h after treatment with Bmf Bmf Bcl-2 Bcl-xL Bcl-2 Bcl-xL Bmf Bmf siRNA and performed reciprocal coimmunoprecipitation experiments in total protein lysates with anti-Bcl-2 , anti-Bcl-xL , and anti-Bim antibodies . As shown in Figure 7a , Bim is displaced from Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL in response to paclitaxel treatment in MDA-MB-468 cells , and knockdown of Bmf effectively inhibits this process . Likewise , depletion of Bmf by siRNA treatment greatly diminished paclitaxel-induced dis-placement of Bim from Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL in BT20 cells Figure 7b . In both cases , the same effect is observed when reciprocal immunoprecipitations are studied . Reasoning that Puma binds to Bcl-xL and displaces Bim to execute its proapoptotic function in response to paclitaxel treatment in T47D cells , we sought to understand whether a similar mechanism of cooperation exists between Puma and Bim as we have seen between Bmf and Bim . To test this , we treated T47D cells with paclitaxel for 12 h after treatment with Puma siRNA and performed reciprocal coimmunoprecipita-tion experiments using anti-Bcl-xL and anti-Bim antibodies . Our results show that depletion of Puma by siRNA treatment decreased paclitaxel-induced displacement of Bim from Bcl-xL , consistent with a mechanism whereby increased Puma levels disrupt Bim Bcl-xL complexes to trigger apoptosis Figure 7c . Bim is required for paclitaxel killing in 3D spheroid culture . As monolayer cell cultures may fail to recapitulate the in vivo milieu of breast tumors , we tested whether Bim and Bmf has a similar important proapoptotic function in cells grown in 3D culture . Treatment of BT20 , MDA-MB-468 , and MCF-7 with Bim or Bmf siRNA duplexes did not interfere with the growth and spheroid formation of these breast cancer cells in Algimatrix 3D culture plate Figure 8a . Notably , BT20 and MCF-7 cells form mass-like spheroids and MDA-MB-468 cells form grape-like spheroids when grown in 3D cell culture conditions . We verified the efficiency and specificity of knockdown of Bim and Bmf in spheroids by immunoblotting of spheroid protein lysates Figure 8b . Immunoblotting results clearly showed that both Bim and Bmf were efficiently depleted in 3D spheroids . Furthermore , siRNA-mediated depletion of Bim or Bmf protected against paclitaxel-induced cell death as shown viability by alamarBlue assay Figure 8c , supporting the prodeath function of Bim and Bmf in response to paclitaxel treatment in breast cancer cells . T47D Discussion Although taxanes have been a mainstay of chemotherapy for breast cancer for two decades , the mechanism by which paclitaxel kills breast cancer cells has been poorly under-stood . There have been suggestions , however , that Bim is a consistent participant in death signaling from paclitaxel . Observations of loss of paclitaxel killing with loss of Bim have been made in lymphocytes , 17 neuroblastoma , 25 and non-small cell lung cancer.26 In these studies , however , it was not clear how Bim was dynamically responding to paclitaxel . In baby mouse kidney epithelial cells , paclitaxel was found to cause an increase in Bim protein levels that could be inhibited by H-ras expression.20 A separate study suggested that paclitaxel caused a transcriptionally mediated increase in Bim in breast cancer cell lines.27 Bim levels increased at the relatively late time point of 48 h , however , well after the time we see most breast cancer cells commit to apoptosis , suggesting that this phenomenon may be occurring down-stream of the commitment to cell death . Nonetheless , our initial expectation was that we would observe paclitaxel induce an increase in Bim in our breast cancer cell lines . Instead , we found that Bim levels , with the exception of a modest increase in T47D , stayed constant in breast cancer cells . However , we still found that Bim was required for killing . This apparent paradox was solved by our observation that Bim was displaced from antiapoptotic proteins after paclitaxel treatment in all breast cancer cell lines studied . In three out of the four cell lines , we found that the factor displacing Bim was the BH3-only protein Bmf . In fact , there was remarkable correlation between the temporal and protein-specific-binding patterns of Bmf and the displace-ment of Bim . In MCF-7 cells , after paclitaxel treatment , 120 120 120 Cell 40 Cell 40 Cell 40 % 20 % 20 % 20 0 0 0 Bmf bound Bcl-2 , but not Bcl-xL or Mcl-1 , and Bim was displaced from Bcl-2 , but not Bcl-xL or Mcl-1 Figure 2a and b . In MDA-MB-468 and BT20 cells , Bmf bound to Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL , but not Mcl-1 Figure 6a and b , and Bim was displaced from Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL , but not Mcl-1 Figure 4b and c . In the case of T47D , as no Bmf is detectable , but Bim is nonetheless displaced , it seems likely that a different protein is responsible . Remarkably , we detected increased Puma and Bim levels in T47D cells after paclitaxel treatment Figure 3d . Puma has been shown to mediate cell death in response to various proapoptotic stimuli28,29 and depletion of Puma by siRNA decreased paclitaxel-induced cell death in T47D cells , indicating that the increase in Puma protein levels can functionally complement for the absence of Bmf expression during paclitaxel-induced apoptosis . In fact , Puma was also identified as a direct activator BH3-only protein , and it is possible that it may contribute to paclitaxel-induced cell death directly by activating Bax or Bak.30 Nonetheless , depletion of Puma did not affect paclitaxel-induced cell death response in other breast cancer cell lines Supplementary Figure S5a�c . Specifically , Puma is required for the displacement of Bim from Bcl-xL on paclitaxel treatment in T47D cells , consistent with a mechanism whereby Puma acts as a sensitizer upstream of mitochondrial cell death pathway . A summary of this model maybe found in Figure 8d . In addition , although the small-molecule Bcl-2 inhibitor ABT-737 did not have any proapoptotic effect when used alone , it restored the sensitivity of Bmf or Bim siRNA-pretreated MCF-7 cells to paclitaxel-induced cell death . Although ABT-737 itself did not induce apoptosis when used at 100 nM concentration , it effectively kills MCF-7 cells with an EC50 value of 2.88 mM , at which antiapoptotic reserve is efficiently saturated . Considering this notion , we can argue that coordinated paclitaxel-mediated prodeath signals may be needed for neutralizing antiapoptotic potential , facilitating Bmf to promote apoptosis by displacing Bim . The paclitaxel-sensitizing effect of ABT-737 was more significant in Bmf-depleted cells , supporting the function of Bmf as a sensitizer BH3-only protein , which ABT-737 may functionally mimic in MCF-7 cells treated with paclitaxel . Bim and Bmf share the properties of interacting with dynein motor components , dynein light chains 1 and 2 , respectively.19,23 JNK-dependent phosphorylation of Bim and Bmf was shown to mediate UV-mediated apoptotic response through releasing these proteins from dynein motor compo-nents.31 It is interesting to note that dynein motors themselves associate with the microtubule network , the target of paclitaxel . It is also possible that Bmf associates preferentially with the actin network through DLC2 association with the myosin V motor complex there . This moves the question of how paclitaxel kills breast cancer cells , a step further upstream from the mitochondrion . What regulates Bmf�s ability to displace the Bim that is prebound to antiapoptotic proteins ? It does not seem to be a matter of increased Bmf levels , as total cellular levels do not generally change in response to paclitaxel in the cells studied here . Our results suggest that there is an obscure mechanism that alters Bmf heterodimerization to cause death from taxol . Candidate mechanisms would include posttranslational modification , which we have not yet identified . However , it is intriguing to speculate that identification of the mechanism altering Bmf heterodimerization would provide a novel target for potential chemotherapeutic exploitation , as this is apparently an im-portant feature of paclitaxel�s ability to kill breast cancer cells . Earlier examination of the participation of Bcl-2 family proteins participation in death signaling has focused on changes in protein levels , either increase in proapoptotic members or decrease in antiapoptotic members . In this paper , we show that a novel third mechanism , serial displacement of BH3-only proteins , is responsible for killing of breast cancer cells by paclitaxel . This mechanism has the potential to generate new targets for anticancer therapy by directly targeting cellular components that control BH3-only protein heterodimerization .

20448642	TC Thomson1 and J Johnson* , 1 www.nature.com cdd Oocyte Development , Death , and Clearance Developing germ cells in females of different species are referred to as oocytes . Oocytes develop into the fertilization-competent eggs that support offspring production . Although the process of oocyte development termed as oogenesis differs greatly between insects and vertebrates , many clear developmental stages1,2 and the genes that regulate them3,4 are highly conserved . Also conserved are the mechanisms that control oocyte death and the clearance of their corpses . In insects , 5 avians , 6 and mammals , 7 apoptosis has been considered the primary mode of oocyte death however , it is increasingly clear that autophagy also has a function.8,9 Studies of oocyte death have revealed that phagocytic cells engulf and destroy oocyte �corpses.� These are the immediately adjacent somatic cells , follicle cells in insects , 5 and granulosa cells in mammals.10 A critical mechanism that regulates female fertility is regulating the availability of fertilization-competent eggs . Egg production in Drosophila has been shown to be regulated by nutritional amino-acid availability , and endocrine and paracrine hormone signaling.11 The rate of production of new egg chambers by the germ and somatic stem cells of the germarium slows when flies are placed under starvation conditions.11,12 In addition , it has long been known that immature egg chambers containing oocytes degenerate and die upon starvation , within the germarium or alternatively within �mid-stage� stage 8 9 egg chambers11 see Pritchett CT , USA et al.13 for review . We sought to determine the relative impact of decreased �production� versus increased �destruction� because of nutritional withdrawal on egg laying . During periods of compromised nutrition , activity of the target of rapamycin TOR kinase is decreased , leading to conserved pleiotropic downstream effects including a general inhibition of translation , 14 reduced cell proliferation , 15 and reduced tissue growth.16 For these reasons , experimental manipulation of TOR signaling is often used to mimic nutritional conditions . The macrolide compound rapamycin RAP blocks its eponymous target TOR by binding an intracellular receptor , the immunophilin FKBP12.17 RAP is produced by the actinomycete bacteria Streptomyces hygro-scopicus and was discovered for its potent anti-mitotic properties when applied to fungi . It is interesting that a supposedly rare bacterial product such as RAP elicits such conserved anti-growth and , where applicable , immuno-suppressive responses in many organisms.18 Accordingly , studies have shown that Drosophila larvae raised on food containing RAP show significant growth restriction and lessened survivability.19 We hypothesized that this model of TOR inhibition would be a similarly useful model of nutritional compromise in adult flies , and would result in consistent oocyte loss . It has been supposed that oocyte loss occurs because of impaired intrinsic physiological and biochemical pathways within the oocyte e.g . compromised genetic , epigenetic , or cytoplasmic oocyte competence to produce offspring when fertilized . This model requires that oocyte compromise occurs first , and that signaling during degeneration and death provokes surrounding somatic cells to clear and dispose of its corpse.11,13 Instead , we show here that follicle cell invasion and phagocytosis of oocytes can be induced in the fly Drosophila melanogaster by RAP ingestion , without a requirement for oocyte degeneration or death . We further show that genes required for the establishment and main-tenance of follicle cell epithelial polarity during the develop-ment are also required for RAP-induced egg chamber destruction . We show that the process can be induced by RAP in mouse follicles cultured in vitro as well , implicating a conserved process of inducible somatic oocyte destruction ISOD as an important regulator of oocyte survival and thus fertility . Results ISOD in the fly . We first placed newly eclosed virgin females with males under complete starvation conditions agar gel plates , on food containing 10 mM RAP , or on food containing ethanol vehicle . Evaluation of ovaries and egg chambers from treated flies revealed differences between the three groups Figure 1 . By day 3 of treatment , ovaries from fed flies vehicle-treated showed the entire continuum of oogenesis Figure 1a . Instead , starved flies showed almost completely degenerate ovaries Figure 1b consis-tent with halted egg chamber production by germ stem cells.12 Unlike fed or starved flies , flies housed on food containing 10 mM RAP consistently showed the presence of egg chambers up to mid-stages Figure 1c , confocal fluorescence micrograph in Figure 1d and degenerating egg chambers were most often seen the most mature position Figure 1d , arrowheads . These data revealed two important features of RAP�s effects on oogenesis as compared with starvation . First , RAP treatment correlates with increased destruction of egg chambers at the mid-stages . Second , RAP treatment results in a surprising continuation of the production of new egg chambers by the stem cells of the germarium below , Figure 2 . We first characterized this RAP-specific destruction of egg chambers , then measured the consequences of a dose curve of RAP treatment on embryo laying . In our analysis of RAP-induced egg chamber destruction Figure 1e , we took advantage of features of degenerating mid-stage egg chambers of starved adult flies as identified by Mazzalupo and Cooley.5 In our hands , the first sign of degeneration was seen in posterior follicle cells PFC of stages 8 and 9 egg chambers . RAP ingestion consistently induced a loss of PFC epithelial apicobasal polarity LOP characterized by Figure 1e panel i , again compare with normal intact egg chamber in top panel PFC �piling up� and taking on a disorganized appearance . LOP was confirmed by staining treated and control ovarioles for Armadillo protein , which was seen to redistribute in the PFC of RAP-treated flies Supplementary Figure S1 . After �piling up , � follicle cells were seen invading the oocyte inset of Figure 1e panel i compare with untreated control in top panel of Figure 1e . This effect was specific to stages 8 and 9 egg chambers , as no cells in larger or smaller egg chambers showed signs of disorganiza-tion . Instead of having an obvious degenerate appearance , egg chambers exhibiting posterior LOP appeared otherwise intact , exhibiting non-degenerate nurse cell NC nuclei and ring canals Figure 1e , panels i and ii . Use of a transgenic fly line that expresses green fluorescent protein GFP in germ cells see Materials and Methods revealed uptake of the GFP by the invasive PFC Figure 1e , panels i and ii , * , and insets , showing that phagocytosis of oocyte cytoplasm and yolk Figure 1eii , * , and inset by PFC begins soon after LOP . Consistent degenerative steps followed , in which NC nuclei became condensed and borders between NC , including ring canals , were disrupted beyond recognition Figure 1eiii . Follicle cells can be seen intermixed with the degenerating oocyte and NC . Finally , an egg chamber remnant Figure 1eiv consisting of irregular follicle cells with central disorganized actin-rich structures Figure 1eiv , arrowhead and fragmented NC nuclei remains . Quanti-fication of egg chambers undergoing degeneration in response to RAP followed to determine whether the features of degeneration were induced in a consistent manner . Assessment of over 100 mid-stage egg chambers from flies housed on vehicle , 10 , or 20 mM RAP showed that consistent proportions of degenerating egg chambers with invasive phagocytic PFC , but intact NC versus those with invasive PFC and NC apoptosis , were present at 40 h post-treatment Figure 1f . The in vivo effects of RAP ingestion were recapi-tulated in an in vitro ovariole culture system Figure 1g , after20 . In all , we placed approximately 150 ovarioles into culture either containing 100 mM RAP or vehicle . After 2 h , 40 % of stage 8 9 egg chambers showed degenerative features egg chambers with either PFC LOP alone or in combination with NC apoptosis and as seen in vivo , whereas 8 % of vehicle-treated stage 8 9 egg chambers showed signs of degeneration . The above data suggest that the features of egg chamber destruction can be placed into a stepwise , developmental order cartoon schemes and proposed stages of egg chamber degeneration as induced by RAP are shown in Supplementary Figure S2 . We determined the consequences of RAP treatment on fertility by performing an assessment of embryo laying when newly eclosed females were mated and housed on a dose curve of the drug for 19 days Figure 1h . Initial controls in w* pVasa-me31B-GFP were placed with males under starvation conditions resulted in essentially zero embryos laid until flies were moved to food Figure 1h , �FED� . Separate mating groups were housed on food containing a dose curve of RAP see �Analysis of RAP uptake by flies� in Materials and Methods up to an approximate LD20 7 days dose 20 mM . RAP decreased the number of embryos laid per fly in a dose-dependent manner . When moved to food lacking RAP , flies showed a substantial recovery in embryo laying Figure 1h , �DRUG REMOVED� . Importantly , separate controls were performed in which males housed on RAP for 6 days were moved to food lacking drug and mated with virgin females . No reduction in male fertility was detected not shown . Having characterized RAP-induced oocyte destruction and its consequences for fertility , we asked whether new egg chamber production by germline stem cells continued or was arrested in the presence of the drug . Continued stem cell production of egg chambers in the presence of RAP . To determine potential effects of RAP on egg chamber production and growth , we evaluated mitotic figures in flies housed on �rich food� containing 10 mM RAP Figures 2b , e , and h or vehicle Figures 2a , d , and g . Alternatively , flies were �starved� by housing on plates of hydrated agar Figures 2c , f , and i see Materials and Methods . We then examined whole-mount fluorescence immunohistochemical preparations of ovarioles for cells positive for the mitotic marker Ser10-Phosphorylated Histone H3 P-HH3 Figures 2a�c between the germarium and stage 6 egg chambers . Interestingly , RAP treatment did not decrease the total number of mitotic cells relative to vehicle . We counted an average of 3.5 mitotic cells per ovariole 53 positive cells 15 ovarioles in vehicle-treated flies example in Figure 2a versus 3.4 cells per ovariole 54 positive cells 16 ovarioles in flies housed on 10 mM RAP Figure 2b . Consistent with an earlier report , 12 starved control flies had reduced mitotic activity , having only one mitotic cell per ovariole 22 positive cells 22 ovarioles Figure 2c . When considering mitotic activity within the germaria of the above ovarioles only , vehicle , RAP-treated , and starved flies showed 9 , 7 , and 1 germaria with one or more positive cells examples shown in Figures 2d�f , respectively . P-HH3 staining was recapitulated by assessment of mitotic chromosomes using DNA staining alone Figures 2g�i . Thus , new egg chamber production and growth in early stages continues nearly apace when RAP is applied . This is counter to the effects seen in most cell types studied , which instead favor slowed proliferation when TOR kinase is specifically inhibited.19,21 In our studies , only starvation correlated with ovariole cell cycle arrest , consistent with earlier findings.12 Inducible PFC destruction of egg chambers . Having characterized the effects of RAP on oogenesis and embryo laying , our next objective was to determine whether the effects of RAP treatment was indeed dependent on the inhibitor binding its known receptor , FKBP12 . First , we determined the expression of FKBP12 in stage 8 egg chambers Figure 3a . FKBP12 was found to be expressed in follicle cells and NCs , with lower levels detected in the oocyte . We then generated fly lines that express RNAi targeted to FKBP12 in follicle cells in different regions of the egg chamber . We hypothesized that knockdown of FKBP12 in PFC would inhibit egg chamber destruction , perhaps leading to lessened LOP , or lessened follicle cell invasion into the oocyte . Accordingly , we hypothesized that controls using an anterior follicle cell AFC -specific promoter would not prevent the process . Our hypothesis proved correct , as flies bearing a PFC-specific GAL4 driver and UAS-FKBP12 RNAi example of FKBP12 expression knockdown in PFC shown in Figure 3b , additional examples in Supplementary Figure S3 continued to lay embryos when housed with males on 10 mM RAP Figure 3c . We counted embryos laid per fly from our experimental and control strains on each day post-eclosure for 6 days . To ensure that we accounted for basal strain laying differences , we calculated the percentage of embryos laid versus vehicle-treated same-strain controls . When raised on the 10 mM concentration of RAP that obliterated embryo laying by wild-type flies Figure 1h , flies expressing an AFC-specific GAL4 driver and UAS FKBP12 RNAi , also flies expressing the driver or UAS RNAi alone , and flies expressing the PFC-specific driver and RNAi instead showed a significant rescue of embryo laying Figure 3c . As the GAL4 UAS system used is known to be effective in somatic cells , but not the germline , 22,23 and RNAi has been shown to be non-functional in oocytes until much later in oogenesis stage 14,24 , it is likely that laying indeed results from somatic follicle cell effects and not from any unanticipated knockdown effects within oocytes . Beyond the immediate result , the demonstration that the RAP receptor is required in follicle cells for the drug�s effects , this experiment allowed us to address a long-standing question in reproductive biology . Egg chamber death in insects and ovarian follicle death � termed as atresia � in mammals have been studied for many years . Oocyte loss in insects and mammals has been discussed in terms of a supposed function in �quality control , � in which oocytes that have diminished genetic , epigenetic , or cytoplasmic integrity die and are then cleared by surrounding somatic cells . However , it has never been conclusively determined whether intrinsic oocyte damage is in fact a prerequisite for oocyte loss . We used this PFC-specific FKBP12 knockdown system to address this question as follows . If maternal RAP damaged oocytes during development , even though embryo laying was rescued in the knockdown flies , a fraction of damaged embryos would be incapable of developing into adults . To test this , we moved laid embryos from PFC FKBP12 knock-down flies to fresh standard fly food containing no RAP to avoid the problem of RAP preventing larval development as per Zhang et al.19 . We found that 108 of 120 embryos hatched and developed into normal adults by way of comparison , 112 of 120 wild-type control embryos from untreated mothers that were similarly moved to fresh fly food developed into adults . This result shows that maternal RAP treatment does not compromise an oocyte�s e.g. the germ compartment�s ability to complete oogenesis and give rise to offspring . Instead , we have shown that oocyte-extrinsic cues can induce somatic follicle cells to destroy oocytes that would otherwise be capable of giving rise to offspring . As FKBP12 expression is required within PFCs for the induction of mid-stage egg chamber destruction by RAP , and normal oogenesis and offspring production occur in our FKBP12 PFC knockdown model , somatic follicle cell-specific effects are both necessary and sufficient to carry out oocyte destruction and halt oogenesis and fertility . We thus refer to this process as ISOD to make a clear distinction with models of oocyte loss that involve earlier or concurrent oocyte damage . Although we were able to define ISOD as an ordered process with consistent consequences , the genes that execute oocyte destruction within follicle cells remained unknown . We hypothesized that genes known to control follicle cell development and or follicle cell epithelial polarity were required for the initiation or execution of the process of egg invasion and destruction . ISOD requires intact signaling by genes involved in the control of PFC tissue size and epithelial polarity . We engaged in a candidate gene approach to test whether known regulators of follicle cell layer development are also required for ISOD . We first confirmed that egg laying was halted in wild-type Canton-S flies and the me31b GFP controls used earlier when fed RAP . To account for the action of RAP on the TOR signaling pathway , we examined embryo laying by Drosophila target of rapamycin dTOR mutant flies . Zhang et al.25 showed that strong mutations in dTOR kinase exhibit growth retardation and significantly compromised oogenesis . We hypothesized that compromised oogenesis would occur even in flies heterozygous for a strong loss-of-function dTOR allele , and that this would be exacerbated by RAP treatment . Next , we evaluated members of the Salvador�Warts�Hippo SWH network of proteins known for their functions in the control of cell growth , tissue size , 26 and oocyte axis determination27,28 through action within the PFC . The tumor suppressor Merlin Neurofibromin 2 Mer has recently been proposed to be an SWH network participant , 29 and , through the regulation of Warts Wts and Hippo , has also been shown to be required to establish proper oocyte axis formation.30 Wts and two unique alleles of mer31 were tested here . Scribble scrb and discs large dlg are among the genes that control the polarity of the follicle cell layer32,33 by participating in junctional complexes between epithelial cells , and flies heterozygous for these genes were also tested . Last , we tested whether Draper drpr , a gene that acts as a receptor for dead and dying cells during the development of the nervous system , 34 is required for oocyte destruction . Drpr has also been shown to function within cell competition models , in which cells of abnormal size e.g . Minute mutations die and are targeted for destruction.35 Here , we hypothesized that drpr would be required to target and engulf oocytes in a similar manner . Our preliminary screen was executed as follows . Embryo laying of mutant and wild-type flies was monitored every 24 h for 6 days in the presence or absence of RAP , or under starvation conditions . First , examination of ovaries and ovarioles was performed on untreated flies from all strains and we found that there was no significant difference between the basal rate of egg chamber degradation in any strain when compared with Canton-S flies . Of all strains , only wts had a significantly altered rate of embryo laying laying approxi-mately half the embryos per day as the other strains . The average number of embryos laid by all other strains on the first 6 days post-eclosure was indistinguishable from Canton-S flies data not shown . In the presence of 10 mM RAP , Canton-S and me31b-GFP flies laid a small fraction of eggs compared with vehicle-only controls Figure 4a , data graphed as a percent embryos laid of vehicle-treated controls at days 3�6 of treatment . dTOR ? , scrb ? , lgl ? , and drpr ? not shown , see below flies all showed the same drastic loss of oogenesis as found with wild-type flies . In striking contrast , flies heterozygous for functional alleles of several of our candidate genes rescued embryo laying in flies fed RAP Figure 4a . Heterozygous dlg null allele dlglv55 ? , mer ? , and wts ? mutants showed significantly increased embryos laid per fly versus wild-type controls and controls for genetic background see Materials and Methods . Examination of whole ovary pairs representative mer4 ovaries from flies raised on 10 mM RAP shown in inset Figure 4a and ovarioles from treated mutant flies showed the expected rescue of oogenesis these mutants had vastly fewer degenerating egg chambers on RAP than controls . To test whether flies showing rescued oogenesis were simply showing an overall increased resistance to RAP , 20 mM was applied , a dose that we found is the approximate LD20 7 days for all wild-type and mutant fly lines tested . We found that even at this sometimes-lethal dose , surviving dlg ? , mer ? mer4 ? at 20 mM shown , and wts ? flies laid significant numbers of embryos . The similar lethality of this dose across strains suggests that individual mutants are not more resistant to high concentrations of RAP in food . Further , control western blots Figure 4b revealed that the dTOR kinase substrate p70S6-kinase is phosphorylated at essentially wild-type levels in untreated dlglv55 ? , mer ? , and wts ? mutant flies , and its phosphorylation is greatly diminished in RAP-treated flies of each strain . This suggested that the reduced ISOD seen in mutants is unlikely to be a result of de-regulated TOR signaling as a result of each mutation . We performed additional controls to confirm the genetic basis of rescued embryo laying in flies fed RAP . We controlled for the genetic background of dlg lv55 and mer 4 by generating heterozygous flies in a wild-type Canton-S background . Both outcrossed control strains showed a significant rescue of egg laying on RAP similar to their parent strains data not shown . Further , comparison between two alleles of mer 31 showed that flies heterozygous for a weaker allele , mer3 , had a delayed rescue compare mer3 ? and mer 4 ? on day 3 of embryo collection Figure 4a and fewer average embryos laid when compared with flies heterozygous for a stronger allele , mer4 ? mer 3 results in an amino-acid substitution , M177I , although mer 4 is a premature stop codon mutation , Q170STOP . We also tested flies heterozygous for a temperature-sensitive allele of dlg dlg hf with near-wild-type function at permissive temperature 181C and hampered function at restrictive temperature 251C . We found that both heterozygous flies bearing the null allele dlg lv55 and , sepa-rately , the temperature-sensitive allele dlg hf at restric-tive temperature robustly rescued embryo laying , whereas dlghf ? flies raised at the permissive temperature resulted in fewer embryos laid . In light of the rescue of oogenesis , embryo laying , and offspring production in epithelial polarity mutants , we tested whether these mutations also rescue oogenesis under conditions of nutritional compromise . We housed flies under complete starvation conditions agar plates alone , partial starvation conditions grape juice agar plates5 , or on �rich food grape juice agar with added yeast5 .� As seen in wild-type and me31b-GFP flies Figure 1h , �STRV� , egg chamber production by epithelial polarity mutant flies was completely blocked when they were housed on agar plates lacking juice data not shown . Comparison between rich food and partial starvation revealed a vast reduction in embryo laying in flies housed on juice agar in heterozygous dlglv55 ? , mer4 ? , and wts ? flies Figure 4c . Of the mutants , only the dlg allele showed slight but significantly increased embryo laying under partial starvation conditions versus �wild-type� me31b-GFP controls . Here again , we tested dlglv55 ? and mer4 ? outcrossed into a Canton-S background , and found nearly identical effects correlating with each mutation not shown . Analysis of ovaries , ovarioles , and embryos from mutants raised under the specified conditions followed . Although embryo laying was partially rescued in the noted mutants , we did detect differences in egg chamber degeneration in mutants raised in the presence of RAP versus the process seen in wild-type flies Figure 1e . Degenerating egg chambers from dlglv55 ? Figure 4d , mer3 ? Figure 4e , and mer4 ? Figure 4f flies are shown � compare with �wild type� me31b-GFP example Figure 1eii and iii . Degenerat-ing mid-stage dlglv55 ? egg chambers were characterized by intact and non-invasive PFC epithelia surrounding apoptotic NC nuclei . In keeping with embryo laying data , comparison between the two alleles of mer shows that the weaker allele mer3 ? Figure 4e correlates with increased follicle cell disorganization relative to a stronger allele mer4 ? Figure 4f .31 Although PFC were more disorganized in mer3 ? than mer4 ? egg chambers , no oocyte invasion by PFC was seen in these mutants . These data further show that gene dosage of epithelial polarity genes controls the initiation and execution of ISOD in response to RAP . We interpreted these data to mean that the induction of PFC LOP is required for the successive steps of ISOD , and when not induced efficiently as in the case of the mutants that rescue egg laying in the presence of RAP , the process is bypassed , and oogenesis continues . It is striking that two copies of dlg , mer , and wts are required to induce and execute ISOD comparison between mutant phenotypes summarized in cartoons in Supplementary Figure S4 . These mutants reveal that genes involved in the establishment and main-tenance of epithelial polarity are also required for the regulated loss of polarity and subsequent oocyte invasion of PFC seen during induced oocyte destruction . In contrast , flies mutant for the engulfment receptor drpr maintained on RAP engage in stage 8 9 ISOD in a manner that approximates that seen in wild-type flies . Drpr mutants show all of the hallmarks of ISOD . Interestingly , drpr mutant ovarioles were found to contain an elevated number of egg chambers with apoptotic nuclei at every stage of development Thomson and Johnson , unpublished , suggesting that the basal rate of clearance of dead and dying cells in wild-type egg chambers is under-appreciated . This is in keeping with the function of Drpr in the recognition and clearance of dead , damaged , and dying neurons , 34 and the observation that Minute cells die before being recognized , surrounded , and cleared during cell competition.35 However , as there is no apparent requirement for Drpr for oocyte invasion and destruction by follicle cells , the likelihood that oocyte damage and or death signals need not precede invasion was further supported . Combined with the rapid induction of the process e.g. from treatment to egg chamber remnant in approximately 2 h , and the follicle cell-specific requirement of FKBP12 for induction and execution , ISOD seems to represent a novel mode of cell death that involves regulated epithelial polarity and activation of a phagocytic program to destroy an adjacent cell . Consequences of RAP treatment on offspring development . We went on to test the potential of the rare wild-type embryos laid by RAP-treated wild-type females or the comparatively abundant embryos laid by RAP-treated heterozygous mer , dlg , or wts flies to hatch and develop to adulthood . As mentioned , male reproductive function was not affected by RAP . Also as mentioned , RAP treatment of larvae phenocopied by TOR mutations compromises growth , development , and survival to adulthood.19,36 We thus moved laid embryos from treated flies of these genotypes to food containing no drug and found that embryos laid by RAP-treated mothers were grossly normal . However , hatching and development to adulthood was compromised in offspring of treated mothers as follows 7 % 4 55 of Canton-S , 40 % 72 180 of mer4 ? , 25 % 20 120 of wts ? , and 32 % 50 157 of dlglv55 ? hatch and survive to adulthood , respectively . Compared with the approximately 90 % hatching and survival rate of FKBP12 PFC knockdown offspring Figure 3c and above this suggests that although oogenesis is rescued , defects in offspring can arise when RAP is present and ISOD does not occur or is not executed correctly . ISOD is conserved in the mouse . As mentioned , mammalian7 and avian6 follicles bearing oocytes die in a process referred to as atresia . Atresia culminates in the regression of the follicle in a little understood process in which a fraction of live granulosa cells engulfs dying and dead granulosa cells and the oocyte , 10 resulting in a degenerate remnant . Earlier studies in our laboratory37 showed that RAP treatment of preantral e.g . immature mouse follicles cultured in vitro resulted in compromised follicle growth because of the inhibition of granulosa cell proliferation , without inducing granulosa cell death . Our Drosophila results spurred us to repeat those experi-ments and carefully assess the disposition of oocytes and follicles after culture in RAP . As expected , vehicle-treated follicles showed significant granulosa cell proliferation 48 h after culture in media contain-ing the gonadotrophin FSH compare freshly isolated uncul-tured follicle in Figure 5a to same follicle cultured in vehicle , Figure 5b . We found that RAP treatment caused three dose-dependent effects on cultured follicles . First , in keeping with the effects seen in flies , oocytes were displaced by granulosa cells in a manner that rendered the oocytes unrecognizable Figure 5c . A similar loss of oocytes can be induced by omitting FSH from culture media Figure 5d . Second , follicles are seen in which the granulosa cell layers did not proliferate , but remain intact Figure 5e . Treated follicles lacking oocytes or that did not grow were confirmed as viable using a biochemical assay after Yaba et al. , 37 data not shown , showing that the destruction of oocytes in these mouse follicles was again unlikely to be a passive degenerative process as in flies . Last , we found that either FSH omission or treatment with 200 nM RAP resulted in a fraction of follicles that lost spherical integrity and �plated down� onto the culture surface Figure 5f . This result is reminiscent of the LOP seen in treated flies and ovarioles and warrants further study as regards the �polarity� of granulosa cell layers . These data are summarized in the graph in Figure 5g . These data suggest that at least in the case of RAP treatment , that oocyte invasion and destruction by adjacent somatic cells is conserved in the mouse during the early window of ovarian follicle growth . It remains to be seen whether somatic-specific effects are sufficient to cause oocyte destruction as seen in the fly . As orthologs of genes relevant to epithelial apicobasal polarity and growth control have been detected within mouse ovarian follicles including scribble and discs large38 , it is possible that the genes involved in initiating and executing oocyte destruction are also conserved in mammals . Discussion ISOD is a unique mechanism that controls oocyte survival . We , therefore , show that the response to the bacterial product RAP is unique from that of complete starvation Figures 1a�e , h and 2 , and that this response is follicle cell specific Figures 3 Supplemetary Figure S3 . We determined that the ovaries of dTOR ? flies neither contain an increased basal rate of degrading egg chambers , nor does heterozygosity for this allele results in reduced embryo laying compared with wild-type flies , showing that reduced gene dosage of the RAP target kinase alone does not result in oocyte destruction . Consistent with this , larvae heterozygous for a dTOR mutant allele also do not show slowed growth or development to eclosure when untreated . However , the addition of RAP to larval food resulted in an additive effect in which dTOR ? larvae developed to eclosure days slower than wild-type larvae.19 In our studies , dTOR ? flies fed RAP laid almost no embryos , just as found with wild-type flies Figure 4a . Further , the induction of oocyte destruction by RAP was shown to require FKBP12 expression Figure 3 and to correlate with significantly reduced phosphorylation of the dTOR substrate p70-S6 kinase Figure 4b . These data support the RAP-sensitive TOR complex 1 TORC1 as the inhibited target that results in ISOD , but alterations in PFC polarity and position during invasion suggest that inhibition of dTOR within the actin cytoskeleton regulating TORC239 may also be involved . We further show that genes required for the establishment and or maintenance of proper PFC epithelial polarity are also required for the induction of oocyte destruction Figure 4 during RAP treatment . As flies that bear a single copy of dlg fail to initiate oocyte destruction e.g . do not lose follicle cell polarity see Figure 4d and flies heterozygous for mer Figures 4e and f or wts show disorganized PFC organiza-tion after RAP treatment , but not PFC invasion or phago-cytosis , the successive stages of oocyte destruction correlate with two intact copies of these genes . Prevention of the induction of ISOD not only rescues the destructive process seen in mid-stage egg chambers , but can entirely rescue the production of normal mature eggs and normal offspring in certain cases . These data are consistent with earlier studies , in particular those identifying the impact of nutritional compromise on egg chamber production11,12 and destruction.5 We have added to this body of work in the following ways . First , the use of RAP both reveals its unique effects on oogenesis and also allows us to place the successive stages of egg chamber destruction in temporal order . Second , we have identified genes responsible for the initial step in ISOD , the loss of PFC epithelial polarity . Last , assessment of embryo laying and offspring production in flies shows that altering the control of epithelial polarity in PFC can rescue not only oogenesis , but also offspring production below . Further analysis is war-ranted to determine the effects of dTOR pathway mutations25 and specific dietary conditions amino-acid and or sugar availability and hormonal ecdysone , juvenile hormone , sex peptide stimuli11 on egg production and destruction . ISOD response is distinct from models of follicle cell tumorigenesis . The surprising requirement for genes involved in follicle cell epithelial polarity for ISOD induction reveals new information about Dlg , Mer , and Wts function . Zhao et al.32 showed that increasingly strong discs large mutations result in increased invasion of follicle cells into the germ compartment of egg chambers . This invasion was enhanced by concurrent heterozygosity for lgl , wts , and scrb . In the case of double mutants , follicle cell proliferation was seen to be strongly enhanced resulting in large follicle cell tumors in mid-stage egg chambers and beyond . In no case did we see follicle cell proliferation during stage 8 9 ISOD . Importantly , the weakest example s of dlg mutants showed no follicle cell invasion , 32 in contrast to our results when those same flies were housed on RAP or were partially starved . Also of interest is our finding that scrb and lgl mutants did not rescue oogenesis in the presence of RAP , unlike mer and wts . The combinatorial action of these genes during tumorigenesis is , therefore , different than their functions in the control of mid-stage egg chamber destruction . These results speak of an interesting gene dosage-dependent mechanism , in which homozygosity for the above epithelial polarity genes is required for a regulated loss of polarity involving rearrangement of the oocyte and follicle cell actin cytoskeleton and the activation of a phagocytic program in follicle cells on the ingestion of RAP . That single distant , unrelated , and �mild� e.g . do not act as dominant alleles under control circumstances mutations can function in a dominant manner in the presence of RAP bears further study � it may be that other genes have the same dosage requirement for their action in follicle cells and in other epithelia . The loss of epithelial polarity induced by RAP was also reminiscent of the work by Mirouse et al. , 40 who showed that �energetic stress� in their model , reduced sugar availability resulted in an LOP in follicle cell clones mutant for the AMPK catalytic subunit ampka . As AMPK is known to act upstream of TOR kinases , our data are consistent . However , in contrast to that work , in which LOP was detected in follicle cell clones in many stages of egg chamber development , we only detected altered follicle cell organization in stages 8 and 9 egg chambers . This suggests that additional factors maintain epithelial organization in egg chambers outside of the mid-stages during RAP ingestion . Implications for female fertility . Our data also preliminarily support a novel example of cellular destruction of a neighboring cell , limited to a specific developmental window of time and location mid-stage egg chambers . The rapid execution time , its dependence on somatic follicle cell FKBP12 function , and our lack of detection of oocyte death when flies , ovarioles , or mouse follicles are treated with RAP invokes a striking interpretation adjacent somatic cells can apparently invade and destroy the oocyte without earlier oocyte death or damage signals . The recognition of this inducible developmental program of oocyte destruction has several implications beyond the immediate control of reproduction . That the different modes of induction , for example starvation and RAP treatment , result in different outcomes is suggestive of unique evolutionary strategies to control oogenesis in either a food-or natural antibiotic-dependent manner . In flies , these data support a hypothesis in which the establishment and maintenance of immunophilin FKBP12 , etc. function in the genome would confer a significant reproductive advantage when molecules such as RAP are encountered , by preventing embryo laying in the short term , until an environment that will support larval development is encountered . Last , the conservation of this inducible mode of oocyte destruction in mammals suggests that the loss of immature oocytes during post-natal life may not only partly depend on intrinsic oocyte �quality� genetic epigenetic or cytoplasmic integrity , but also may be controlled by the rate that somatic cell destruction of adjacent oocytes is induced . Future efforts to screen for genes required for mid-stage ISOD onset may reveal a large assortment of triggers and responsive genes that integrate environmental information to control fertility in mice as well as flies . Our data support a new direction for efforts to protect fertility blocking somatic cell destruction of oocytes . This mechanism warrants further study as the signaling network between the induction of ISOD through RAP or starvation and the execution of egg chamber destruction is essentially unknown . Materials and Methods Fly stocks and genetics . All fly strains are from the Bloomington Stock Center unless otherwise mentioned .

Starvation , fly food supplementation , and embryo laying assessment . Agar plates containing grape juice have been used to mimic starvation conditions by other groups . We use hydrated agar containing no juice or other additives so that no energy or amino-acid sources are available in which �starvation� is indicated . As flies lay embryos that can survive to adulthood albeit at a greatly reduced rate on grape juice agar , we refer to that treatment as �partial starvation.� RAP experiments were performed using �rich food , � grape juice agar plates supplemented with yeast . Concentrations of RAP were determined to be that of the volume of yeast slurry plus the volume of the juice agar within the collection plate 2.5 ml . Plates were changed daily with fresh aliquots of RAP mixed within a yeast slurry . Embryo laying experiments were performed at 251C except for dlghf flies whose embryo laying was tested at 181C as well as 251C . In brief , five virgin females of each genotype were collected and crossed to three wild-type males . Either Canton-S or w , P { w ? , vasP-Me31B-GFP } males were used with no difference in subsequent egg laying seen between paternal strains . Flies were put into a cage with a collection plate having 250 ml of a 25 % yeast slurry with vehicle or RAP LC Laboratories , Woburn , MA , USA spread evenly over the surface of the collection plate . After confirming that male function was unaffected by RAP ingestion , gross assessment of embryo cellularization was performed for each experiment using light microscopic evaluation . Fertilization and early embryonic development were found to be unaffected by maternal RAP ingestion in this manner . For all reported parameters , each strain was tested in at least three separate trials . Analysis of RAP uptake by flies . When 100 females either housed on vehicle or food containing the highest dose , 20 mM RAP , for 72 h , zero RAP was detected in vehicle-treated flies and 90 ng RAP mg wet weight of flies was detected in the RAP group . Rapamycin content was determined by GC MS Rocky Mountain Laboratories , Fort Collins , CO , USA . As individual flies weigh approximately 1.2 mg , each fly contains approximately 108 ng RAP when fed the drug at this dose for this time period . Western blot analysis . For analysis of intracellular proteins , cells were lysed using 1 % NP40 and 0.1 % SDS in the presence of protease inhibitors . Protein concentrations were calculated by BCA assay Pierce Biotechnology , Rockford , IL , USA . A total of 20 mg of each protein lysate were diluted in sample buffer and boiled for 5 min . Proteins were resolved under reducing conditions on either 10 or 12 % SDS�PAGE gels and then transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes NEN Life Sciences , Boston , MA , USA . Membranes were blocked at room temperature for 1 h with 5 % powdered milk in PBS 0.05 % Tween 20 PBS-T . After three washes for 10 min , each with PBS-T , membranes were incubated overnight at 41C with primary antibody Rabbit anti-phospho p70 S6 kinase Thr389 at 1 1000 , Cell Signalling and mouse anti-b-actin 1 10 000 Sigma , St. Louis , MO , USA in PBS-T 1 % FFPM . After this incubation , membranes were washed three times as before and then incubated at room temperature for 1 h with the appropriate secondary antibody conjugated to peroxidase 1 10000 , Southern Biotech , Birmingham , AL , USA in PBS-T 1 % milk . After three washes for 10 min each with PBS-T and three washes for 10 min each with distilled water , the peroxidase-conjugated antibody was detected by enhanced chemiluminescence Perkin Elmer , Waltham , MA , USA . b-actin was used as internal control , in addition to Ponceau Red , to validate transfer quality and the amount of protein loaded onto the gels . Fluorescence visualization and immunostaining . Ovaries from various fly strains and experiments were dissected in PBS , fixed in devitellinizing buffer with 5 % formaldehyde methanol free to preserve GFP activity , under heptane for 5 min . After fixation , ovaries were washed several times with PBT PBS ? 0.1 % Tween-20 over 2 h after which the ovaries were dissected by pipetting up and down into a 200 ml pipet tip . For visualization of DNA and actin in combination with transgenic GFP , Hoescht dye 0.2 mg ml and Alexa Fluor 555-conjugated phalloidin Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA , USA per manufacturer�s instructions were used . For whole-mount immunostaining , ovaries were then blocked in PBT-B PBT ? 2 % bovine serum albumin for 4 h at room temperature or overnight at 41C . Ovaries were incubated with primary antibodies mouse anti-FKBP12 , BD Biosciences , San Jose , CA , USA rabbit anti-PHH3 Ser10 , Cell Signaling Technologies mouse anti-Armadillo , Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank U. of Iowa for 12�16 h at 41C , diluted in PBT-B . Ovaries were then washed for 1.5 h with 10 changes of PBT , and then probed with labeled secondary antibodies Alexa Fluor 488 - , 568 - , or 633-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or mouse diluted 1 500 in PBT-B plus 2 % normal goat serum and incubated for 2 h at room temperature in the dark . Ovaries were then washed as above , except during the first wash 15 min Hoechst 0.2 mg ml , Invitrogen and Alexa Fluor 488 or 555 phalloidin was added . Ovaries were mounted in Prolong Gold Invitrogen and visualized using a Leica TCS SP5 confocal microscope . Conflict of interest The authors declare no conflict of interest . Acknowledgements .

20448643	In most cell types , it has been well established that activation of nuclear factor-kB NF-kB antagonizes apoptotic cell death triggered by tumor necrosis factor receptor1 TNFR1 and several other stimuli.1,2 Although the mechanisms by which anti-apoptotic genes that are regulated by NF-kB inhibit TNF-induced apoptosis remain to be fully explored , it has been well established that the anti-apoptotic function of NF-kB downstream of TNFR1 involves suppression of the c-jun N-terminal kinase JNK cascade.3�5 Indeed , in mouse embryonic fibroblast cells MEFs lacking p65 , inhibitory kB kinase IKKb , or stably expressing superrepressor IkBa , there is persistent JNK activation in response to TNF because of the lack of expression of NF-kB-mediated JNK inhibitors.6,7 This persistent JNK activation contributes to TNF-induced apoptosis , making those MEFs highly sensitive to TNF-induced apoptosis . Earlier , it has been proposed that a subset of NF-kB target genes including growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible 45b GADD45b , X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein XIAP , manganese superoxide dismutase MnSOD , and ferritin heavy chain FHC are capable of antagonizing JNK signaling.3,6,8,9 However , the existing literature on the function of these proteins in TNFR1-mediated JNK signaling cascade is still confusing and controversial . For instance , genetic analysis of the GADD45b-or XIAP-deficient mice showed no defect in TNF-induced JNK activation and apoptosis.10,11 Moreover , in several NF-kB-deficient cells , MnSOD expression did not substantially inhibit TNF-induced apoptosis , 7,9 suggesting that other proteins might be required cooperatively or independently to suppress the JNK signaling pathway . Thus , it seems that the primary mediators of NF-kB-mediated control of JNK signaling downstream of TNFR1 remain elusive . As one of the NF-kB target genes , A20 has been well established as a negative feedback loop to block NF-kB activation in response to TNF.12�15 Recently , substantial progress has been made in understanding the biochemical and molecular mechanisms by which A20 constitutes a negative feedback loop to terminate NF-kB activation . A20 possesses dual ubiquitin editing functions to receptor inter-acting protein1 RIP1 , a critical signaling molecule in TNF-mediated NF-kB activation . A20 is capable of deubiqui-tinating K63-linked polyubiquitin chains of RIP1 by its N-terminal ovarian tumor OTU domain and adding K48-linked ployubiquitin chains by the C-terminal zinc finger ZnF containing domain.13�15 In addition to RIP1 , other ubiquitinated proteins such as TRAF6 and CIAP1 have been identified as A20 targets in the NF-kB signaling pathway.16�18 Given the well established anti-apoptotic function of NF-kB and the ability of A20 to terminate NF-kB activity , A20 is expected to possess a potent pro-apoptotic function . However , the accumulating evidence suggests the opposite A20 acts mainly as an anti-apoptotic protein , as it protects most cells from TNF-induced cell death . Overexpression of A20 protects breast cancer MCF-7 cells , fibrosarcoma WEHI164 cells , embryonic fibroblast NIH3T3 cells , and L929 cells from TNF-mediated apoptosis or necrosis.19�21 A20 also protects the cells from a number of apoptotic stimuli other than TNF . For instance , A20 protects endothelial cells from Fas CD95 receptor ligation , lymphoblastic B cells from serum depletion , and macrophages from oxidized low-density lipoprotein.22�24 However , up to date it is still largely unknown how A20 paradoxically protects cells from TNF-induced apoptosis even it is capable of inhibiting NF-kB . Therefore , we aimed to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying the anti-apoptotic function of A20 by focusing its regulatory function in JNK signaling downstream of TNFR1 . The results from this study reveal a novel anti-apoptotic mechanism of A20 in TNF signaling pathway A20 binds to apoptosis signal-regulating kinase1 ASK1 and mediates ASK1 degradation , leading to suppression of JNK activation and eventually blockage of apoptosis . Results A20 has an essential function in the NF-jB-mediated suppression of JNK activation and apoptosis on TNFR1 ligation . To test whether A20 is involved in TNF-induced JNK activation , we first examined the time course of JNK activation after TNF treatment in the cells overexpressing A20 by ectopic infection of recombinant adenoviral vector carrying A20 rAd-A20 . TNF treatment resulted in a rapid and progressive induction of A20 expression , and overexpression of A20 efficiently blocked TNF-induced IkBa degradation Figure 1a and b , which is consistent with an earlier report that A20 functions as a negative regulator of NF-kB.16 Pretreatment with a protein synthesis inhibitor , cycloheximide CHX , which blocks NF-kB-dependent transcriptional events , not only abolished A20 expression , but also resulted in persistent JNK activation in response to TNF , suggesting that TNF-inducible de novo protein synthesis , including A20 , is required to suppress the persistent JNK activation . More importantly , overexpression of A20 led to abolishment of JNK activation , as well as IkBa degradation after treatment with TNF and CHX TNF CHX Figure 1a and b . Consistently , knockdown of A20 by specific small hairpin RNA shRNA elicited the persistent IkBa degradation and JNK activation after TNF treatment Supplementary Figure S1 , indicating that A20 has a dual capacity to have in down-regulation of TNF-induced NF-kB and JNK activation . Moreover , cells with overexpression of A20 were found to be more resistant to apoptotic cell death induced by TNF CHX , as evidenced by the cell viability assay Figure 1c and d and cleavage of both caspase-3 and poly ADP-ribose polymerase PARP Figure 1e . Pre-treatment of JNK-specific inhibitor SP600125 dramatically suppressed TNF CHX-induced cell death and the cleavage of caspase-3 Figure 1f and g , confirming that the JNK activation contributes in TNF-induced apoptosis , as reported earlier.5 On the other hand , pretreatment of an irreversible caspase-8 inhibitor z-IETD-fmk also partially suppressed TNF CHX-induced apoptosis and caspase-3 cleavage , but with a lesser extent than that of SP600125 Figure 1f and g . These results suggest that under the condition of NF-kB blockage , persistent JNK activation is a major cell death mechanism in TNF-induced apoptosis . To investigate directly whether A20 is responsible for the NF-kB-mediated suppression of JNK signaling , rAd-A20 was infected ectopically into MEFs that are null of functional components of NF-kB signaling . Similar to HeLa and HEK293 cells as shown earlier , TNF treatment induced progressive expression of A20 and transient JNK activation in wild-type WT MEFs Figure 2a . In contrast , in p65 , IKKb , and TNFR-associated factor 2 5 TRAF2 5 double knockout DKO MEFs , there was no induction of A20 , but with more persistent JNK activation after TNF treatment Figure 2b�d , left panels . Remarkably , overexpression of A20 almost completely blocked the persistent JNK activation in these cells deficient of NF-kB Figure 2b�d , right panels . Earlier , it has been reported that NF-kB-defective cells are highly susceptible to TNF-induced apoptosis , because of persistent JNK activation.7,25 Consistently , overexpression of A20 in NF-kB-deficient cells offered significant protection against TNF-induced cell death Figure 2e�g . Taken together , these findings show that the capacity of A20 to block the persistent JNK activation is responsible for its anti-apoptotic function against TNF-induced killing in multiple cell types studied . As NF-kB-mediated suppression of JNK activation is mainly executed through induction of its target genes , we next examined whether A20 affects the transcriptional induction of NF-kB-mediated target genes , which are known to inhibit JNK signaling . Here , we found that in cells infected with the control vector rAd-GFP , both A20 and GADD45b were transiently induced with TNF treatment , whereas the induction of A20 was more evident and persistent than that of GADD45b Figure 3a , left panel . Notably , the transcription of other NF-kB target genes Mn-SOD , XIAP , and FHC were marginally induced or occurred at late time after TNF treatment . Importantly , TNF-induced up-regulations of these genes , including GADD45b , were impaired by A20 over-expression Figure 3a , right panel , which is likely because of the inhibitory effect of A20 on NF-kB signaling , as evidenced by the absence of p65 nuclear translocation in those cells with overexpression of A20 Figure 3b . Taken together , data from this part of the study thus suggest that A20 is an essential NF-kB-mediated target gene to control JNK signaling after the TNF receptor ligation . A20 does not affect the TRAF2 recruitment into TNFR1 signaling complex on TNF stimulation . It is worth noting that A20 is recruited into TNFR1 signaling complex by interacting with TRAF2 , a molecule required for activation of TNF-induced JNK signaling.26,27 Therefore , it is hypothesized that the inhibitory effects of A20 on TNF-induced JNK activation might be achieved through disruption of the TNFR1 signaling complex involving TRAF2 . To assess whether A20 directly affects the formation of the plasma membrane bound TNFR1 signaling complex complex I , the recruitment of RIP1 and TRAF2 into this complex was examined . Treatment of cells with TNF led to immediate recruitment of RIP1 and TRAF2 , as well as A20 into complex I Figure 4a , left panel . Whereas the recruitment of RIP1 into complex I in rAd-GFP-infected cells was rather transient after TNF treatment , such RIP1 recruitment remained to be hyperubiquitinated in rAd-A20-infected cells Figure 4a , first row . However , unexpectedly , the extent and duration of TNF-induced TRAF2 recruitment into complex I was not affected by A20 overexpression Figure 4a , second row , indicating that suppression of TNF-induced JNK activation by A20 is independent of TRAF2 recruitment into complex I . This conjecture also seems to be consistent with the earlier observation that A20 is capable of protecting TRAF2 5 DKO MEFs against TNF-induced cell death Figure 2g . To further assess whether A20 affects TNF-induced JNK activation by acting on the site of complex I , the binding of RIP1 and TRAF2 with TNFR1 in those NF-kB activation-deficient cells were monitored . As expected , TNF treatment of p65 , IKKb , and TRAF2 5 DKO MEFs failed to express A20 Figure 4b , fifth row and resulted in no detectable recruitment of A20 into TNFR1 Figure 4b , third row . Interestingly , TNF-induced RIP1 and TRAF2 recruitments were found to be normal in p65 and IKKb MEFs , although TNF-induced RIP1 ubiquitination was more quickly disappeared in these NF-kB activation-deficient MEFs Figure 4b , top two rows . From the results of above protein-binding experiments , we conclude that the inhibitory effect of A20 on TNF-mediated JNK activation is not achieved through disruption of proximal TNFR1 complex complex I formation . We further examined whether A20 affects the TNFR1-associated cytoplasmic complex complex II formation , as reported earlier.28 Immunoprecipitation assay with a anti-FADD antibody showed that A20 was recruited into complex II in a time-dependent manner after TNF , but not TNF CHX treatment Figure 5a , second row . On the other hand , TNF-induced interaction between processed caspase-8 p43 41 and FADD seemed mainly in the presence of CHX Figure 5a , first row , suggesting that the recruited A20 into complex II may affect the FADD-mediated caspase-8 activity . However , the overexpression of A20 partly suppressed the interaction between caspase-8 and FADD , as well as caspase-8 cleavage after TNF CHX treatment Figure 5b , first and fourth rows , whereas it markedly suppressed caspase-3 cleavage Figure 5b , bottom row . Together with the observations that the potency of the specific caspase-8 inhibitor to suppress TNF-induced apoptosis Figure 1f and g , these data thus suggest that the recruitment of A20 into complex II is less likely to be of importance for its anti-apoptotic function under the condition of TNF CHX treatment . A20 physically interacts with ASK1 in the JNK signaling cascade . As it seems that the inhibitory effect of A20 on TNF-induced JNK activation is neither associated with TNFR1 signaling complex formation nor the downstream NF-kB-mediated transcription of target genes , we next examined whether A20 physically interacts with the components of JNK signaling cascades . To address this issue , HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with Xp-tagged A20 and flag-tagged kinases [ mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase MAP3K GCK , MEKK3 , ASK1 , mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase MAP2K MKK4 7 or mitogen-activated protein kinase MAPK JNK1 2 ] , and the protein�protein interactions were assessed . Notably , A20 bound strongly to ASK1 , but not to other MAP3K , MAP2K , or MAPK tested Figure 6a�c . The endogenous association of A20 with ASK1 was also confirmed in HEK 293 cells Figure 6d and e . More importantly , TNF treatment led to an enhanced interaction between A20 and ASK1 , and such interaction was dependent on A20 expression Figure 6f . To determine the interaction regions , the deletion mutants of ASK1 and A20 were constructed and analyzed for their ability to interact , respectively Figure 6g and i . ASK1 mutant containing a non-catalytic amino-terminal region ASK1-N , but not the ASK1-K containing the kinase domain or the ASK1-C containing the carboxy-terminal region , was able to interact with A20 Figure 6h . In parallel , A20-N , but not A20-C , bound to ASK1 Figure 6j . The specific association between A20 and ASK1 through the amino-terminal region was further confirmed in the cells co-transfected with each of amino-terminal fragments Figure 6k , clearing indicating that ASK1 and A20 use their amino-terminal regions for the protein� protein interaction . A20 reduces the stability and promotes the degradation of ASK1 through the ubiquitination process . As A20 restricts TNF-induced NF-kB signaling through its ubiquitin editing activity on RIP1,14,15 it is thus of interest to test whether A20 would be affecting the stability of ASK1 through a similar mechanism . To address this hypothesis , we first examined whether the protein level of ASK1 was changed by overexpression of A20 . TNF CHX or high concentration of hydrogen peroxide H2O2 treatment resulted in substantial increase of ASK1 expression Figure 7a , top row . Such observations are indeed consistent with an earlier report , 29 and indicate that such extracellular stimuli may enhance ASK1 stability . Notably , the level of ASK1 was dramatically decreased in cells with overexpression of A20 Figure 7a , top row , without alteration of RIP1 and TRAF2 protein levels . In the same blot , TNF-or H2O2-induced JNK activation was suppressed by A20 overexpression Figure 7a , second row . Moreover , H2O2 induced the cleavage of caspase-3 and PARP was significantly blocked by A20 overexpression Supplementary Figure S2 . To further evaluate the effect of A20 on ASK1 protein level under the physiological condition , endogenous ASK1 and A20 levels were determined at different time points after TNF treatment . Indeed , there was enhanced ASK1 level at earlier time points 10 to 30 min , but started to decrease by 1 h when A20 was coincidently induced Figure 7b , left panel . However , the enhanced protein level and kinase activity of ASK1 by TNF continued to maintain up to 2 h in cells treated with TNF CHX Figure 7b , right panel , suggesting that induced expression of A20 by TNF may affect the protein stability of ASK1 . To confirm this possibility , we examined whether the kinetics of ectopically expressed ASK1 levels are altered by A20 overexpression in the presence of CHX . Consistently , progressive reduction of ASK1 level was observed in cells with overexpression of A20 , whereas the ASK1 level remained stable up to 6 h after CHX treatment in cells without A20 expression Supplementary Figure S3 . Furthermore , the proteasome inhibitor MG132 significantly reversed the effect of A20 overexpression on the ASK1 protein level Supplementary Figure S4 , indicating that A20 targets ASK1 degradation through the proteasome-dependent pathway . We next examined the susceptibility of WT and ASK1 MEFs in response to TNF CHX , aiming to understand the function of ASK1-mediated JNK activation in TNF-induced killing . As consistent with an earlier report , 30 ASK1 MEFs was defective in persistent JNK activation , and highly resistant to TNF CHX-induced cell death as compared with WT MEFs Supplementary Figure S5 . These results thus suggest that A20 may target ASK1 degradation , thereby suppress ASK1-mediated JNK activation , and even-tually inhibit TNF-induced apoptosis . To address whether the conserved ZnF domain of A20 might be responsible for ASK1 degradation , the full-length A20 with point mutations of conserved cystein residue to alanine within OTU C103A , ZnF3 C521A , C524A , or ZnF4 C624A , C627A domain were generated , as reported earlier.16 Overexpression of WT-or OTU MT-A20 dramati-cally decreased ASK1 level , whereas ZnF4 MT-or ZnF3 ZnF4 MT-A20 almost completely eliminated the effect of A20 on ASK1 level Figure 7c , top row . Such results thus indicate that the conserved ZnF4 domain of A20 is critical for ASK1 degradation . To determine whether A20 ligates ubiquitin chains to ASK1 , the immunoprecipitants of endogenous ASK1 were assayed by immunoblotting with anti-ubiquitin . Strikingly , overexpression of A20 reduced protein level of ASK1 with a concomitant increase of polyubiquitinated ASK1 Figure 7d , top two rows . Moreover , in cells treated with TNF , there was increased level of polyubiquitinated ASK1 from 30 min onward Figure 7e , left panel , whereas overexpres-sion of A20 markedly enhanced ASK1 polyubiquitination Figure 7e , right panel , confirming the ability of A20 to mediate ASK1 ubiquitination and degradation . To rule out the possibility of non-specific interaction of anti-ASK1 polyclonal antibody used in the immunoprecipitation assay , cells were co-transfected with flag-ASK1 and HA-ubiquitin , and then tested the ability of A20 to ubiquitinate the ASK1 . Consis-tently , TNF treatment triggered ASK1 ubiquitination and this ASK1 ubiquitination was dramatically exaggerated by over-expression of A20 Figure 7f . Taken together , we present clear evidence that A20 blunts TNF-induced JNK activation and apoptosis through interaction with ASK1 to promote its ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal-dependent degradation . Enhanced expression of A20 in breast cancer . The specific pathologic context where A20 participates as a predominant player in the cell death and survival process might allow a selective link between A20 and the ASK1�JNK pathway in certain types of human diseases , such as cancer . Thus , we examined the expression levels of A20 in human breast cancer tissues . As consistent with earlier reports , 31,32 the expression levels of A20 were markedly enhanced in breast cancer tissues , as evidenced by immunohisto-chemistry and immunoblot analysis Figure 8a and b . Cancer tissues had much higher immunoreactivity than the surrounding normal tissues , and the punctuated granular expression of A20 associated with certain vesicles was observed mainly in the cytoplasm Figure 8a . On the contrary to the expression pattern of A20 , breast cancer tissues expressed lower levels of ASK1 in almost all the samples tested Figure 8b , top two rows . Taken together , these results suggest that enhanced expression of A20 may contribute to cellular survival through selective inhibition of the ASK1�JNK signaling during the tumorigenic processes . Discussion Herein , we have identified a novel mechanism responsible for the anti-apoptotic function of A20 in TNF signaling . A20 acts as a principle mediator in the termination of TNFR1-mediated JNK activation . More importantly , the engagement of A20 in this process is independent of TNFR1 signaling complex formation . Finally , we provide evidence that A20 interacts with ASK1 , leading to ASK1 polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation . Therefore , it is believed that A20 is an important element in the cross-talk between NF-kB and JNK that largely determines the fate of the cell in response to TNF . It has been well established that suppression of the JNK signaling pathway represents a crucial protective mechanism mediated by NF-kB from TNF-induced apoptosis.3 Earlier reports suggest that NF-kB-inducible proteins such as GADD45b , XIAP , MnSOD , and FHC have important functions in suppression of JNK activation.3,8,9 In this study , MnSOD was induced by TNF at late times after the onset of the persistent JNK activation and apoptosis Figure 3a . Further-more , XIAP and FHC were marginally or poorly induced by TNF treatment . Thus , it seems that these factors are unlikely to be important mediators in JNK inhibition by NF-kB . One critical finding from this study is that A20 not only completely blocked the transcription of other NF-kB target genes known to antagonize JNK signaling , but also effectively suppressed TNF-induced JNK activation and apoptotic cell death in NF-kB activation-deficient MEFs Figure 2 . Thus , these findings clearly indicate that A20 , rather than other described earlier JNK inhibitors , has a more predominant function in the suppression of TNF-induced JNK signaling under physiological TNFR1 ligation condition . With regard to TNFR1 signaling , TRAF2 binds to the amino-terminal region of A20 , and this interaction is required for the recruitment of A20 into TNFR1 signaling complex.26,27 Therefore , it is possible that A20 may regulate JNK signaling pathway by affecting this signaling complex formation . Indeed , an early study reported that A20 inhibited the recruitment of death domain proteins TRADD and RIP1 into TNFR1 signaling complex and thus protected Jurkat T-cell from TNF-induced apoptosis.33 In this study , A20 is also found to be transiently recruited into TNFR1 complex I as well as complex II after TNF treatment Figures 4 and 5 . Notably , TNF-induced TRAF2 recruitment into TNFR1 signaling complex was not affected by A20 , indicating that the inhibitory effect of A20 on TNF-induced JNK activation is unlikely to be achieved through TRAF2 . This conclusion was further supported by the fact that TNF-induced TRAF2 recruitment was normal in the condition of CHX pretreatment data not shown or in NF-kB activation-deficient MEFs Figure 4b . These discrepancies with an early report33 might be resulted from cell-type difference and or differences in experimental systems transient adenoviral infection versus stable transfection of A20 . Although TRAF2 is important to activate ASK1 and JNK in response to TNF or H2O2,4,34 we observed that overexpression of A20 sufficiently blocked the TNF-induced JNK activation and apoptosis in TRAF2 5 DKO MEFs Figure 2 . In this regard , it was of interest to determine whether ASK1 might be activated in TRAF2 5 DKO MEFs after TNF treatment . Interestingly , TNF-induced persistent phos-phorylation of ASK1 preserved in TRAF2 5 DKO MEFs Supplementary Figure S6 , indicating that TRAF2 is not absolutely required for TNF-induced ASK1 activation . Earlier , it has been proposed that ROS have an important function in TNF-induced persistent JNK activation under NF-kB-deficient cells including TRAF2 5 DKO MEFs.7 As TRAF6 is also required for ROS-mediated activation and ASK1 and JNK signaling pathway , 35 one possibility is that , in case of TRAF2 5 deficiency , TRAF6 might be involved in TNF-mediated ROS formation and JNK activation . It is well known that the duration of JNK activation is a critical factor in determining the susceptibility of cells to TNF-induced apoptosis persistent JNK activation contributes to TNF-induced cell death.36 Acute JNK induction by TNFR1 likely involves MAP3K of the MAPK ERK kinase MEK and mixed-lineage kinase MLK groups.37 Conversely , the persistent JNK activation downstream of TNFR1 occurs through activation of the ASK1.30 In this respect , the fact that A20 binds to ASK1 , but not to GCK or MEKK3 , and inhibits TNF-or H2O2-induced JNK activation is particularly interest-ing . Furthermore , the results of domain mapping experiments show that A20 binds to the non-catalytic amino-terminal region of ASK1 , which has been shown to be responsible for the interaction with E3 ligase-CIAP1 , -TRAF2 , or thioredoxin , 38,39 suggesting that the association of ASK1 through this amino-terminal region with A20 has an essential function in down-regulation of JNK signaling through regulat-ing ASK1 stability and degradation . Earlier , it has been shown that the protein stability of ASK1 mediated through interaction with E3 ligases is an important mechanism for the regulation of ASK1�JNK signaling cascade in response to ROS or TNF.29,38,39 Therefore , it is conceivable that the complex formation with ASK1 and A20 is a critical step for suppression of the ASK1�JNK signaling cascade and subsequent apopto-tic cell death . However , as there are multiple signaling molecules including A20 and other ASK1-binding proteins recruited into the ASK1 signalosome , 35 further elucidation of dynamic interactions of these signaling molecules within the ASK1 complex is required to provide a better understanding of physiological functions of such a complex . One important hint from this study is that the expression levels of A20 were increased significantly in breast cancer tissues Figure 8 , suggesting that A20 may have an important function in promoting the carcinogenic processes through its pro-survival function . However , intriguingly , some recent genetic analysis showed that A20 was frequently inactivated by somatic mutation or deletion in certain types of tumors including B-lineage lymphomas.40,41 Therefore , further studies are required to define the functional characteristics of A20 in tissue-specific malignancies such as breast cancer .

20467440	Review J Fullgrabe1 , � N Hajji1,2 and B Joseph* , 1 Histones are the chief protein components of chromatin , acting as spools around which DNA winds , and having a role in gene regulation.1 In eukaryotes , an octamer of histones � two copies of each of the four core histone proteins H2A , H2B , H3 and H4 � is wrapped by 147 bp of DNA to form a nucleosome � the fundamental unit of chromatin2 Figure 1a . In addition , histone H1 , located at a position adjacent to the nucleosome core is involved with the packing of the �beads on a string� sub-structures into a higher order structure . In most eukaryotes , histones are expressed as a family of sequence variants encoded by multiple genes . As different histone variants can contribute to a distinct or unique nucleosomal architecture , this heterogeneity can be exploited to regulate a wide range of nuclear functions , and evidence is accumulating that histone variants do indeed have distinct functions . Histones are subjected to a wide variety of post-translational modifications including lysine acetylation , lysine and arginine methylation , serine and threonine phosphorylation and lysine ubiquitination and sumoylation as well as ADP ribosylation , all of which are carried out by histone-modifying enzyme complexes in a dynamic manner reviewed in Kouzarides and Khorasanizadeh3,4 Figure 1b . These modifications occur primarily within the histone amino-terminal tails protruding from the surface of the nucleosome as well as on the globular core region.5 Histone modifications function in both long-term i.e. determinants of chromatin conformation and in more short-term , ongoing processes reviewed in Turner6 . For the latter , histone modifications can be considered the endpoints , on chromatin , of cellular signaling pathways and a mechanism through which the genome can respond to environmental stimuli . An increasing body of evidence suggests that these post-translational histone modifications influence the overall chromatin structure and have clear functional consequences . As a result , work on histone modifications and regulation of gene expression have coalesced into the �histone code� hypothesis , initially proposed by Allis and Turner , that encapsulates the function of histone modifications in chro-matin structure and in the regulation of nuclear functions.7,8 According to the histone code hypothesis , distinct combina-tions of histone modifications are related to specific chromatin-related functions and processes.9 As recent evidences indicate , histone modifications have a role in gene transcription , DNA repair , mitosis , meiosis , development and in apoptosis . Apoptosis , or �programmed cell death , � is an active process fundamental to the development and homeostasis of multicellular organisms . The activation of a genetically controlled cell death program leading to apoptosis results in characteristic biochemical and morphological features that take place both outside and inside the nucleus . Chromatin condensation paralleled by DNA fragmentation is one of the most important nuclear events occurring during apoptosis.10 Owing to the regulated nature of apoptosis , epigenetic features are likely to have a major role in the nuclear changes experienced by apoptotic cells . Histone modifications , and in particular phosphorylation and acetylation , have long been suggested to affect chromatin function and structure during cell death . A decade ago , Lee et al.11 established , using inhibitors of protein phosphatase , that phosphorylation of histones may be involved in thymocyte apoptosis . This observation was later confirmed during astrocyte apoptosis.12 Histone acetylation has long been known to maintain the chromatin in an open and accessible conformation to accommodate the transcriptional machinery and to have a major role in regulating gene expression . In a study of the structural changes that occur in chromatin of apoptotic cells , Allera et al.13 reported that histones became deacetylated in rat thymocytes that were induced to undergo apoptosis by glucocorticoids . Collectively , these results support the idea that chemical modification of histones is involved in the chromatin alterations in cells undergoing apoptosis . In fact , it has further been shown that phospho-rylation of histone H2A , H2B , H3 and H4 , dephosphorylation of histone H1 , acetylation of histone H2B , H4 , hypoacetylation of histone H4 , methylation of histone H3 and H4 and de-ubiquitylation of histone H2A are associated with nuclear events of the apoptotic process Table 1 .14 In this review , we examine and discuss the different histone protein residues that have been shown to be regulated by post-translational modifications during apoptosis � that is the apoptotic histone mark � and how these marks may affect chromatin function and structure during cell death Figure 2 . Apoptotic Dephosphorylated Histone H1 the Lost Mark ? One of the first histone post-translational modifications suggested to be linked to the apoptotic process was the dephosphorylation of histone H1 . Linker histone H1 is highly phosphorylated in normal growing cells . A correlation be-tween early apoptotic dephosphorylation of histone H1 and the onset of typical chromatin oligonucleosomal fragmenta-tion has been described.15,16 Two lines of evidence point to histone H1 contribution to internucleosomal chromatin clea-vage . First , H1 histones are associated with the linker DNA , which connects two adjacent nucleosomes and is the site of DNA cleavage during apoptosis . Second , linker histones enhance the activity of DNA fragmentation factor 40 DFF40 CAD , the nuclease that cleaves DNA during apoptosis . However , recent investigation revealed that there is no strict correlation between initial apoptotic histone H1 dephosphor-ylation and the onset of apoptotic DNA fragmentation . Histone H1 dephosphorylation is neither a prerequisite for nor an absolute consequence of internucleosomal cleavage . More-over , the phosphorylation state of H1 histones does not seem to influence the activation effect of H1 histones on the activity of DFF40.17 Histone H2B phosphorylation at Serine 14 H2B-S14ph has been proposed as an epigenetic marker of apoptotic cells , Table 1 Post-translational histone modifications associated with apoptosis H2B , H3 , H4 induced by multiple death triggers18,19 whereas acetylation at the adjacent Lysine 15 H2B-K15ac is a property of non-dying cells . The H2B-S14ph mark , depending on the cell type or the apoptotic agents used to trigger cell death , has been associated either with chromatin condensation19 or with inter-nucleosomal DNA fragmentation.20 These modifications ap-pear to be reciprocal and deacetylation of H2B-K15 is necessary to allow H2B-S14 phosphorylation.20 Phosphory-lation of H2B-S14 is catalyzed by mammalian sterile twenty Mst1 kinase . Mst1 promotes H2B-S14ph in vitro and in vivo , and the onset of H2B-S14 phosphorylation is dependent on cleavage and activation of Mst1 by caspase-3 , an aspartate-specific protease and critical executor of apoptosis.19,21 Caspase cleavage of Mst1 promotes its nuclear translocation and subsequent chromatin condensation.22 A similar mecha-nism is present in yeast cells . Here , deacetylation of the H2B-K11 histone mark , which is found in growing cells , is necessary to allow the phosphorylation of the apoptotic mark H2B-S10 � these are the corresponding residues for H2B-K15 and H2B-S16 in human.23 Ste20 kinase , a yeast homolog of mammalian Mst1 kinase , also translocates into the nucleus but in a caspase-independent manner and directly phophorylates H2B at Serine 10.24 The conservation of this H2B histone mark and the enzyme system controlling its phosphorylation from yeast to human points to an ancient mechanism likely to regulate cell death in a wide range of organisms . It is worth noting that , the regulator of chromosome conden-sation 1 RCC1 protein , a guanine nucleotide exchange factor , reads the H2B-S14ph histone mark created by caspase-activated Mst1 , in turn reducing RCC1 mobility in the presence of H2B-S14ph . RCC1 normally catalyzes the formation of RanGTP in the nucleus , whereas hydrolysis of RanGTP is stimulated by RanGAP1 and RanBP1 in the cytoplasm . Its immobilization on chromosomes reduces the level of RanGTP in the nucleus , which in turn leads to the inactivation of the nuclear transport machinery . As a consequence , nuclear localization signal-containing proteins , including survival factors such as NF-kB-p65 , remain bound to importins a and b in the cytoplasm.25 Therefore , the H2B-S14ph histone modification is not simply a hallmark of apoptosis but also seems to directly contribute to the inactivation of survival pathways including NF-kB . DNA Repair Survival or Cell Death the Histone sWItCH Phosphorylation on Serine 139 of the histone variant H2A.X H2A.X-S139ph also called gamma-H2A.X g-H2A.X , in response to DNA damage is the major signal for the assembly of the g-H2A.X chromatin domain , a region surrounding an unrepaired DNA double-strand break , that is characterized by the accumulation of a large number of DNA damage response proteins.26 However , g-H2A.X , a hallmark of DNA damage response , also forms early during apoptosis induced by death receptors agonists and stimuli targeting the intrinsic apoptotic pathway.16,27,28 g-H2A.X is initiated in the nuclear periphery immediately adjacent to the nuclear envelope whereas total H2A.X remains distributed throughout the nucleus . This process is referred to as the �g-H2A.X ring�.27,28 The g-H2AX ring contains the activated checkpoints kinases , ATM , Chk2 and DNA-PK the last being the main effector for apoptotic g-H2AX phosphorylation . Notably , the g-H2AX ring formation not only coincides with H2A.X-S139ph but also with the apoptosis-associated histone modification H2B-S14ph.28 Although the regulatory mechanisms and signaling path-ways controlling DNA repair and apoptosis are well charac-terized , the precise molecular strategies that determine the ultimate choice of DNA repair survival or apoptotic cell death remain incompletely understood . The recent discovery of H2A.X Tyrosine 142 phosphorylation H2A.X-Y142ph by the WSTF�ISWI ATP-dependent chromatin-remodeling complex WICH and its dephosphorylation by the EYA phosphatases mammalian homologue of the Drosophila eyes absent , and in particular EYA3 , may provide substantial novel insight into this process.29�32 Williams�Beuren syndrome transcription factor WSTF , a subunit of the WICH complex , bears a novel kinase domain at its N-terminus that constitutively targets H2A.X-Y142ph.29 This single histone modification appears to determine the relative recruitment of either DNA repair or pro-apoptotic factors to g-H2AX sites of DNA damage and functions as an active determinant of repair survival versus apoptotic responses to DNA damage.30 In the presence of H2A.X-Y142ph , binding of repair factors MRE11 , RAD50 , NBS1 , 53BP1 and BRCA1 to H2A.X-S139ph , which is mediated by mediator of DNA damage checkpoint protein 1 MDC1 , is inhibited , whereas recruitment of pro-apoptotic factors such as the stress-response kinase JNK1 is pro-moted.33,34 The simultaneous presence of Y142ph and S139ph marks results in the direct binding of the PTB domain factor Fe65 , which mediates the effective recruitment of JNK1.30 Thus , the balance of H2A.X-Y142ph phosphorylation dephosphorylation may constitute a novel switch mechanism to determine cell fate after DNA damage.29,34 Histone post-translational modifications have the potential to directly modulate nucleosome structure and consequently DNA accessibility . Indeed , the acetylation state of lysine residues regulates both the local chromatin dynamics as well as higher order chromatin structure.35 Acetylation of histone H4 on Lysine 16 H4-K16ac is a prevalent and reversible post-translational chromatin modification in eukaryotes.36,37 This single histone modification both disrupts formation of higher order chromatin structure and changes the functional interaction of chromatin-associated proteins , thereby increas-ing chromatin accessibility.37 It is worth noting that loss of H4-K16ac is a common feature of a number of cancers.38 Histone deacetylases HDAC and histone acetyltransferases control the acetylation state of lysine residues , including those situated in the N-terminal �tails� of histones . HDAC inhibitors HDACIs comprise a diverse range of unrelated compounds that all induce an accumulation of hyperacetylated histones resulting in various biological effects , including cell death.39�41 Various inhibitors of HDAC activity can sensitize drug-resistant cancer cells to DNA-damaging agents.41 However , the mechanisms underlying the effects of HDACIs remain poorly understood . A recent study revealed that the effect of HDACIs is associated with increased acetylation of certain lysines on histones H3 and H4 , including H4-K16ac.40 Overexpression of the histone acetyltransferase human orthologue of the Drosophila melanogaster MOF males absent on the first gene hMOF , known to specifically target H4K16 , was sufficient to mimic HDACI sensitization and H4K16 acetylation , and importantly , knock down of hMOF abolished the HDACI-mediated sensitizing effects as well as the increase in H4K16 acetylation . Conversely , knock down of the H4K16 deacetylase SIRT1 mimicked HDACI treatment whereas overexpression of SIRT1 abolished H4K16 acetyla-tion and significantly reduced the sensitizing effects of HDACIs.40 Thus , the opposing effects of hMOF and SIRT1 regulate H4K16 acetylation showing that this histone mark controls the sensitivity of cancer cells to DNA damage-induced cell death.40 Another apoptotic epigenetic histone mark , which has been proposed to be linked to increased DNA accessibility , is phosphorylation of Threonine 45 within the histone core of histone H3 H3-T45ph . H3-T45ph increases dramatically in apoptotic cells , around the time of DNA nicking . Protein kinase C-d PKCd , which itself becomes highly active after caspase-3 cleavage , was identified as the agent responsible for H3-T45 phosphorylation.42 H3-T45 has been shown to have an important role in nucleosome structure.43 Therefore , given the fact that H3-T45 occupies a structurally interesting position within the nucleosome , it was postulated that phosphorylation of H3T45 by PKCd during late apoptosis induces structural change within the nucleosome to facilitate DNA fragmenta-tion.42 Interestingly , it should be mentioned that in budding yeast H3-T45ph has rather been linked to DNA replication and its absence with replicative defects . In addition , no discernable increase in H3-T45 phosphorylation levels is observed during cell death , indicating that H3-T45ph probably does not function in the apoptotic pathway in yeast.44 Finally , phosphorylation of residue serine 10 on histone H3 H3-S10ph is associated with two apparently opposed chromatin states , namely the highly condensed mitotic chromosomes and the relaxed chromatin of certain activated genes during interphase reviewed in Prigent and Dimitrov45 . H3-S10 phosphorylation also occurs when cells are exposed to various death stimuli suggesting its possible implication in the control of cell survival.46 However , the actual cellular effects of H3-S10 phosphorylation remain enigmatic and it is not yet clear whether H3-S10ph contributes to the apoptotic program . Perspectives The �histone code� hypothesis was proposed as a general-ization of the discovery that combinations of covalent post-translational modifications of histones influence chromatin structure and lead to varied transcriptional outputs.7 Considering the long known influence of histone modifications on the compaction of chromatin , it is reasonable that the chromatin compaction as well as DNA fragmentation occur-ring during apoptosis would need the modification of histone marks . The direct links , uncovered in several recent publica-tions , between apoptosis and histone modifications make it unlikely that they are just a �useless� feature of apoptosis . Similar to the �death code� in informatics , a whole palette of histone modifications seem to occur during apoptosis , creating an epigenetic code , which decides on the destiny of the cell . In fact , several histone modifications have been firmly linked to apoptosis-induced chromatin changes , providing collective evidence for an �apoptotic histone code� Figure 1 . Notably , caspases , a family of cysteine proteases , which have an essential role in the execution of apoptosis , control histone-modifying enzymes and promote histone post-translational modifications i.e . H2A de-ubiquitylation , H2B-S14 and H3-T45 phosporylation . In addition , the presence or absence of specific epigenetic histone marks occurring during apoptotic cell death appear to work as binding platforms for the recruitment of protein complexes regulating cell life and death decisions . For example , H2B-S14 phosphorylation contributes to the inactivation of survival pathways by immobilizing the nucleotide exchange factor RCC1 and consequently the nuclear import of pro-survival factors . H2A.X-Y142ph , in concert with H2A.X-S139ph gH2A.X , also acts as a binding site for proteins , contributing to the decision between DNA repair and survival or cell death . In the presence of H2A.X-Y142ph , recruitment of repair factors to H2A.X-S139ph is inhibited whereas recruitment of pro-apoptotic factors is promoted . Finally , several histone modifications correlate with the occurrence of apoptotic-related chromatin alterations increased chromatin accessibility H3-T45ph , H4-K16ac , internucleosomal DNA fragmentation dephosphorylation H1 , H2B-S14ph and chromatin condensa-tion H2a de-ubiquitinylation , H2B-S14ph . Thus , the balance between different histone marks may constitute a code that determines cell fate . However , it should be mentioned that a block of apoptosis was not always reported when the described histone modifications were absent . There are also contradictory reports in the literature regarding the functional consequences for loss of histone mark . For example , whereas downregulation of Mst-1 , which results in reduction of H2B-S14ph level , was reported to suppress apoptosis , 25 the combinatory treatment of HDACI and glucocorticoid , repressing H2B-S14 phosphorylation and internucleosomal DNA degradation , did not prevent apoptosis in thymocytes.20 Thus , whether each of the histone marks reviewed participates in the death process per se or is only necessary for the disposal of the DNA still awaits additional investigations . In addition , further work remains to be done to better establish the sequence of codes i.e. combinations of histone modifications , timeline of events and interplay of modifica-tions within the death code regulating the different nuclear apoptotic steps . For example , how H4-K16ac-mediated chromatin decondensation and the resulting increase in sensitivity to death triggers such as DNA damage can be linked to the H2B-S14ph and other epigenetic marks that are associated with apoptotic chromatin condensation and fragmentation . The role of most apoptotic histone marks in diseases remains to be discovered . It is well known that in cancer the epigenomic landscape undergoes extensive distortion com-pared to normal cells . The loss of H4-K16ac has already been described for several cancer types and shown to influence cancer cell sensitivity to chemotherapy.38,41 Another example is the increased H3-K27 methylation , associated with apop-tosis in osteosarcoma cells , 47 which is also associated with aberrant gene silencing in various forms of cancer and reprogramming of the epigenome during development . Considering the influence of other marks , such as H2B-S14ph on cell death , more deregulation of histone modifica-tions in disease could be imagined . In summary , these unique histone modifications occurring during the course of cell death already provide new features to monitor and study apoptosis .

20467441	Mitochondria are highly dynamic organelles that continuously and reversibly rearrange their structure through the tightly-regulated processes of fission and fusion of their inner and outer membranes.1,2 Mitochondrial fission is regulated by the GTPase dynamin-related protein-1 Drp1 that cycles from the cytosol to mitochondria , where it binds to Fis1 , an integral outer membrane protein , whereas fusion requires the activity of three large GTPase proteins , mitofusin-1 and 2 , and optic atrophy-1 Opa1 .3 Mitochondrial dynamics participate in a cell�s response to fluctuations in oxygen and nutrient avail-ability , 4,5 and contribute to regulation of the development and activity of a number of tissues and organs.6�8 Despite the recognized role played by mitochondria in the overall skeletal muscle function , including its repair after damage , 9�11 the role of mitochondrial fission and fusion in skeletal muscle bioenergetics and development has not been investigated . Interestingly , during myogenic differentiation the short mitochondria of the myoblasts change into the extensive elongated network observed in the myotubes , 12 suggesting that they may have a role in myogenesis . We report here that inhibition of mitochondrial fission , with the consequent formation of a mitochondrial network , is required for myogenic differentiation and that this is depen-dent on inhibition of Drp1 function . Furthermore , we report that endogenous nitric oxide NO generated by the muscle-specific neuronal NO synthase NOS inhibits Drp1-depen-dent mitochondrial fission , and by this inhibition allows the process of myogenesis to occur . The action of NO was reversible with a fast onset and offset , physiological , as it was mediated by cyclic GMP cGMP , and was accompanied by profound changes in the mitochondrial bioenergetics that have a role in myogenesis . Thus NO , by suppressing the activity of Drp1 , allows the formation of the mitochondrial network and the changes in cell bioenergetics needed for myogenesis to occur . Results NO regulates myogenesis and mitochondrial elongation in differentiating myogenic precursor cells through cGMP . We examined the effects of endogenous gene-ration of NO on myogenic differentiation and on changes in mitochondrial morphology . Myogenic precursor cells , freshly isolated from the muscles of newborn mice , were transiently transfected with a red fluorescent protein targeted to mito-chondria mitoDsRed and were induced to differentiate.13 Differentiating primary myogenic precursor cells Figure 1a expressed progressively the differentiation markers Mef-2A , Myo-D , myogenin and sarcomeric myosin MyHC Figure 1b and Supplementary Figure S1b . In parallel morphological studies , mitochondria that were round in shape in proliferating cells were found to become progressively elongated , forming an extensive branched network at 12 h of differentiation see Figure 1a and Supplementary Figure S1a for quantification of mitochondrial elongation , and Supplementary Figure S2 for the 3D reconstructions . These changes in mitochondrial morphology were accompanied by changes in the expression of proteins regulating mito-chondrial fission and fusion , namely Drp1 , mitofusins and Opa1 Figure 1c and Supplementary Figure S1b . The increased expression of these proteins was not due to mitochondrial biogenesis as expression of other mito-chondrial proteins such as cytochrome c and cytochrome c oxidase did not change , neither did we detect an increase in mtDNA Figure 1c and data not shown . nNOS protein expression in differentiating cells was unchanged whereas NOS activity was increased , indicating that myogenic differentiation triggers NOS activation Figure 1d . The increased NOS activity was accompanied by increased generation of cGMP , a physiological messenger generated by NO through activation of guanylate cyclase Figure 1e .14 Both NOS activity and cGMP generation were inhibited by the NOS inhibitor No-nitro-L-arginine methylester L-NAME Figure 1d and e . We examined the role of endogenous NO and cGMP generation on myogenic differentiation and mitochondrial morphology . L-NAME and the guanylate cyclase inhibitor H-1,2,4 -oxadiazolo [ 4,3- ] quinoxalin-1-one ODQ inhibited both expression of myogenic markers Figure 1b and elongation of mitochondria Figure 1a and Supplementary Figure S1 . Inhibition of NO or cGMP gene-ration did not modify the expression of the mitochondria-shaping proteins or of mtDNA Figure 1c and data not shown . The neuronal NOS splice variant m is particularly important in muscle physiology.15 Silencing of the enzyme using a specific siRNA inhibited the expression of myogenic differentiation markers and elongation of mitochondria Supplementary Figure S3 , indicating that NO generation and the consequent elevation of cGMP are required for both mitochondrial elongation and myogenesis . Changes in mitochondrial morphology may be the conse-quence of toxic cellular effects . In differentiating myoblasts neither L-NAME nor ODQ induced significant changes in the basal rate of apoptosis , as assessed up to 72 h of differentia-tion by measuring phosphatidylserine exposure to the plasma membrane in 7-amino actinomycin-D 7AAD -excluding cells Figure 2a and the number of trypan blue-excluding viable cells Figure 2b . Consistently , we did not observe activation of caspase-3 and 9 Figure 2c . Likewise , neither ODQ nor L-NAME induced spontaneous apoptosis in proliferating , undifferentiated myoblasts not shown . These results rule out a toxic action by L-NAME and ODQ . NO cGMP stimulate myogenesis through inhibition of mitochondrial fission . Myogenic precursor cells were co-transfected with vectors coding for mitoDsRed and cytosolic YFP pEN1YFP . After induction of differentiation for 6 h we used real-time confocal microscopy and transmission electron microscopy to investigate the effects of L-NAME and ODQ on mitochondrial morphology . Differentiation for this period resulted in the majority of mitochondria being in the elongated form Figure 3b and c . However , both L-NAME and ODQ induced mitochondrial fragmentation within minutes after their addition , which persisted throughout the time of the analysis 40 min and was confirmed at the ultra-structural level see Figure 3a and Supplementary Figure S4 for electron microscopy images , and Supplementary Figure S5 for the films . The NO donor Z -1- [ 2-2-aminoethyl -N-2-ammonioethyl amino ] diazen-1-ium-1,2 diolate DETA-NO and the membrane-permeable cGMP mimic 8Br-cGMP reversed the effects of L-NAME and ODQ , respectively , indicating the cGMP dependency of NO�s action Figure 3b and c . These results indicate that changes in mitochondrial morphology are due to the actions of NO cGMP . Mitochondrial dynamics depend on the processes of fission and fusion.1,2 We investigated whether NO cGMP regulates fission , fusion or both processes . To examine mitochondrial fusion , we performed a polyethylene glycol fusion assay on myoblasts differentiated for 6 h . Neither L-NAME nor ODQ changed the rate of mitochondrial fusion , as monitored by measuring the appearance of double mtRFP mtGFP-positive mitochondria in the heteropolykaryons in the presence of cycloheximide for a further 6 h after polyethylene glycol addition Figure 4a and b . However , a dominant-negative K38A mutant of Drp116 prevented the effects of L-NAME and ODQ on mitochondrial morphology Figure 4c . This mutant also prevented the slowing of myogenic differentiation induced by L-NAME and ODQ , and enhanced the myogenic process , most likely by inhibiting basal Drp1 function Figure 4d and Supplementary Figure S6 . These results show that mitochondrial elongation by NO is due to reduced fission and that this modulation regulates myogenesis . NO cGMP control Drp1 localization and activity . To investigate how NO regulates the function of Drp1 through cGMP we monitored the activity and sub-cellular localization of Drp1 in differentiating myoblasts . Sub-cellular fractionation and immunoblotting for Drp1 showed that mitochondrial Drp1 localization was significantly increased by L-NAME and ODQ Figure 5a . In addition , ODQ and L-NAME increased the interaction between Drp1 and its mitochondrial receptor Fis1 , as shown by co-immunoprecipitation Figure 5b and data not shown . Finally , L-NAME and ODQ increased the binding of Drp1 to GTP , an assay that measures GTPase activity in intact cells , as shown by pull-down experiments using GTP-conjugated beads Figure 5c . DETA-NO or 8Br-cGMP reversed all the effects of L-NAME and ODQ . Of note , we did not detect any significant changes in the mitochondrial and cytosolic calcium concentrations upon NOS or guanylate cyclase inhibition , thereby ruling out calcium overload as a trigger for fission under these conditions not shown . Drp1 is known to be regulated by means of protein kinase-A and C through phosphorylation . We investigated whether NO cGMP acting through G-kinase induced phosphorylation of Drp1 . As shown in Figure 6a myogenic differentiation was accompanied by phosphorylation of Drp1 , which was prevented by both L-NAME and ODQ . In addition , DETA-NO and 8Br-cGMP induced the phosphorylation of the protein in a manner that was prevented by the G-kinase inhibitor KT5823 and enhanced by BAY41-2272 , which activates guanylate cyclase independently of NO Figure 6b . These experiments indicate that NO cGMP phosphorylates Drp1 through G-kinase and inhibits its function during myogenic differentiation . NO cGMP maintain mitochondrial membrane potential in differentiating myoblasts . We investigated whether changes in mitochondrial morphology and dynamics affected the bioenergetics of differentiating myoblasts , using the F1F0 ATP synthetase inhibitor oligomycin this is used as a sensitive test of latent mitochondrial dysfunction in intact cells.17 In proliferating myogenic precursor cells and in control differentiating myoblasts 6 h oligomycin increased the mitochondrial membrane potential , as indicated by an increase in the mitochondrial fluorescence of the potentio-metric dye tetramethyl rhodamine methyl ester TMRM followed by real-time imaging Figure 7a this is as expected for healthy mitochondria.17 By contrast , in L-NAME-or ODQ-treated differentiating myoblasts , addition of oligomycin led to progressive mitochondrial depolarization , which was fully normalized by Drp1 K38A Figure 7a and data not shown , establishing a link between changes in mitochondrial dynamics and mitochondrial membrane potential . L-NAME and ODQ had no effects on the mitochondrial membrane potential in proliferating cells not shown . These findings suggest that if NO or cGMP is depleted during myogenesis the fragmented mitochondria that result will show a latent mitochondrial dysfunction . NO cGMP regulate mitochondrial respiration and ATP generation in differentiating myoblasts . We next investi - gated the effects that the latent dysfunction observed in mitochondria had on the bioenergetic parameters of differentiating myoblasts , in which NO or cGMP generation was inhibited . Total OXPHOS-ATP , measured in the presence of the glycolysis inhibitors fluoride and iodoacetate , was significantly reduced in ODQ-or L-NAME-treated differen-tiating cells as compared with that in untreated controls . The effects of L-NAME or ODQ were abolished by Drp1 K38A Figure 7b and data not shown . The amount of ATP generated normally by glycolysis was low in each treatment group , with no significant changes induced by ODQ L-NAME or Drp1 K38A Figure 7c . We analyzed cell respiration time 6 h measuring total , oligomycin-resistant proton leak and maximal uncoupled oxygen consumption in proliferating and differentiating myo-genic cells . ODQ and L-NAME did not significantly alter total , oligomycin-resistant or maximal oxygen consumption in proliferating cells not shown , whereas they reduced all respiratory parameters in the differentiating cells Figure 7d . Neither L-NAME nor ODQ had any effect on the residual , mitochondrial-independent oxygen consumption ROC in Figure 7d . To further assess the functional relevance of the changes induced by L-NAME and ODQ on respiration , we measured the ratios of oligomycin-resistant to maximal oxygen consumption and coupled respiration total minus oligomycin-resistant oxygen consumption to maximal . These rates give an estimate of whether changes in total respiration can ultimately affect the ability of the mitochondria to use the proton-motive force to synthesize ATP . In ODQ-or L-NAME-treated cells , the ratio of oligomycin-resistant to maximal respiration was reduced , whereas the ratio of coupled respiration to maximal was increased Figure 7e and data not shown . These data indicate that cells try to compensate for the reduced respiratory capacity induced by impairment of NO or cGMP signaling with enhanced coupling of electron transport with oxidative phosphorylation . All changes induced by L-NAME or ODQ were prevented by Drp1 K38A , indicating that impairment of respiratory function induced by L-NAME or ODQ in differentiating myogenic precursor cells is a conse-quence of changes in mitochondrial dynamics . The use of selective inhibitors of the electron transport chain showed that L-NAME and ODQ decrease mitochondrially generated ATP regardless of which mitochondrial complex was stimulated Figure 7f and data not shown , suggesting that cytochrome c oxidase , the terminal component of the respiratory chain , is the likely target . As with the other parameters investigated , mitochondrial complex activities were restored by Drp1 K38A . NO cGMP and mitochondrial dynamics a quality-control check for myogenesis . To investigate the functional role of the induction of fission and the resulting impaired mitochondrial function , we examined cell sensitivity to oxidative stress . In differentiating myoblasts , apoptosis induced by H2O2 was significantly increased in cells in which NO cGMP signaling was blocked by L-NAME or ODQ Figure 8 . Such increased sensitivity was Drp1-dependent , as shown by its absence in the K38A mutant . No differences in H2O2-induced apoptosis were observed in proliferating cells exposed to ODQ or L-NAME not shown . These results indicate that in differentiating myoblasts impairment of NO cGMP signaling and the ensuing changes in mitochondrial function lead to an increased sensitivity to apoptogenic stimuli . Discussion In this study we show that inhibition of NOS activity prevents the elongation of mitochondria and myogenesis , indicating that NO has a determinant role in these processes by controlling the function and activity of the mitochondrial fission protein Drp1 . Indeed expression of the dominant-negative form of Drp1 K38A reversed the effects on both control of mitochondrial dynamics and myogenesis , which occurred due to removal of NO . These effects were specific to differentiating myoblasts as NO had no effect on mitochondrial shape or activity in the proliferating myogenic precursor cells . The effects of NO were dependent on the activation of guanylate cyclase and the generation of cGMP , which is activated by nanomolar concentrations of NO.18 This indicates that the process described takes place under physiological conditions . NO cGMP acted selectively on mitochondrial fission , directly controlling Drp1 GTPase activity , translocation to mitochondria and interaction with Fis1 . Drp1 activity is known to be tightly regulated through phosphorylation by both cyclin-dependent kinase-1 and the cAMP-dependent protein kinase , and through dephosphorylation mediated by calcineurin.19,20 Our results show that NO phosphorylates Drp1 through G-kinase . This kinase-dependent mechanism of control of Drp1 suggests the need for additional tight levels of regulation of the enzyme , and stresses the importance of this mechanism and the biological relevance of its control by NO . Furthermore , the fact that NO regulates the activity and not the expression of Drp1 points toward a dynamic role of fission control by NO that may be relevant to fine-tuning the process of myogenesis . In neurons high , cytotoxic concentrations of NO have been reported to promote fission and apoptosis and may contribute to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer�s disease.21,22 This effect is mediated by S-nitrosylation of Drp1,23 that is , a mechanism different from the cGMP G kinase-dependent phosphorylation we show here and that activates rather than inhibits the enzyme . These findings , although apparently contradictory to the results reported here , are in keeping with the concept that NO is a double-edged messenger that , depending on its concentration and mechanism of action , can have opposing effects on a particular mechanism or target.24,25 Likewise , the role of Drp1 and fission differ depending on the cell type , due to differences in the cell management of mitochondrial morphology and function . Drp1-null embryos fail to undergo developmentally regulated apoptosis during neural tube formation in vivo , whereas embryonic fibroblasts have normal apoptotic responses , 26 The specific role of NO in regulating myogenesis physio-logically through a mitochondrially linked mechanism raises the question of the biological significance of such control . A possible answer lies in the NO-dependent bioenergetic changes taking places in the mitochondria of differentiating myoblasts and in their pathophysiological consequences that we describe here . Although the mitochondrial membrane potential was main-tained in cells in which fission was taking place as a result of the lack of NO cGMP , its collapse after treatment with the F1F0 ATP synthetase inhibitor oligomycin and the low rate of ATP generation observed in these conditions showed that mitochondrial respiration is impaired . Such reduced activity was a consequence and not a cause of mitochondrial fission as it was reversed by Drp1 K38A . The functional consequence of such a metabolic defect was evident when apoptosis was induced , so that cells in which fission was taking place were more sensitive to an apoptogenic stimulus . It is possible that mitochondria and NO act as a quality-control check of myogenesis . Indeed activation of NOSs depends crucially on the correct architecture of cells and on intracellular signaling pathways that may be disrupted in damaged cells.18,27 The metabolic changes subsequent to the NO cGMP-dependent changes in mitochondrial dynamics appear to follow changes in cytochrome c oxidase activity . A recent study highlighted how this enzyme is regulated by cAMP , with important metabolic consequences , 22 in a manner analogous to the Drp1-mediated , cGMP-dependent mechanism described here . These observations uncover new and significant me-chanisms of regulation of cytochrome c oxidase , with biological consequences that add to the complexity , and recognize the importance of this enzyme for cell pathophysiology.28�30 Previous studies have shown that expression of NOSs is developmentally regulated and that NO acts at various levels in the process of myogenesis , by increasing the secretion of follistatin and follistatin-1-like proteins , 31�33 and cooperating with insulin-like growth factor-II.34 In addition , it favors the activation , proliferation and engraftment of myogenic stem cells.13,35,36 We now show that NO controls the early events in myogenic differentiation . It appears therefore that NO presides over several crucial steps of muscle differentiation that are important in repair , and may explain why NO-based therapies appear to work effectively in reducing muscle damage in muscular dystrophy.31,35 The fact that the action of NO is mediated through inhibition of mitochondrial fission and changes in the metabolic status of mitochondria is of great physiological importance in muscles . In particular , NO controls mitochondrial respiration through reversible inhibition of cytochrome c oxidase , acting as an acute sensor for changes in the oxygen concentration.37,38 In addition , it stimulates mitochondrial biogenesis39,40 a key event occurring in muscle hypertrophy and muscle repair that also contributes to the definition of the slow twitch-oxidative versus fast twitch-glycolytic nature of muscle fibers.9,11,15,41 We now describe a third action aimed at regulating mitochondrial dynamics and the resulting changes in bioenergetics . Oxygen sensing and mitochondrial fission are regulated acutely by NO , whereas mitochondrial biogenesis requires sustained changes in NO concentration.38,39 Understanding whether these actions of NO are independent from each other or are causally linked , in particular if the acute NO-regulated effects on mitochondria influence mitochondrial biogenesis , may lead to a better understanding of the role of NO in modulating the mitochondrial behavior , giving new insights into the importance of energy metabolism in the control of muscle development and regen-eration . In view of the role of NO and mitochondrial dysfunction in muscle degenerative diseases , 35,42�44 these findings will be crucial for designing novel therapeutic approaches to these pathological conditions . Materials and Methods Cell culture and treatment . Myogenic precursor cells were prepared as previously described.45 Briefly , muscle fragments were digested with 2 % collagenase-II and dispase Sigma , St. Louis , MO , USA and Gibco-Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA , USA for 10 min at 37 1C with gentle agitation . The dispersed cells were then collected , pooled , centrifuged , resuspended in Iscove�s modified Dulbecco�s medium supplemented with 20 % fetal bovine serum , 3 % chick embryo extract , 45 100 U ml penicillin , 100 mg ml streptomycin and 50 mg ml gentamycin , and plated onto matrigel , BD-Bioscience , San Jose , CA , USA -coated dishes at a density of 104 cells cm2 . Contamination by non-myogenic cell was reduced by pre-plating the cell suspensions onto plastic dishes where fibroblasts tend to adhere more rapidly . Differentiation was induced by changing the medium to Iscove�s modified Dulbecco�s medium supplemented with 2 % horse serum . Drug treatments were as follows myogenic precursor cells were differentiated for 6 h and then treated with L-NAME 1 mM , ODQ 1 mM , DETA-NO 30 mM and 8Br-cGMP 1 mM , alone or in combination , except for time-course differentiation experiments in which drugs were added immediately after changing to differentiation medium . DNA constructs and cell transfections . Drp1 was purchased from OriGene Technologies Rockville , MD , USA and sub-cloned into pcDNA4 myc-His Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA , USA using the following primers containing the sequences for two restriction sites EcoRV 5�-CGGATATCGTCATGGAGGCGCTA ATTCCT-3� and XhoI 5�-CCTCGAGGTCACCAAAGATGAGTCTCC-3� . PCR conditions , using the Pfu high-fidelity polymerase Stratagene , La Jolla , CA , USA , were 95 1C for 2 min , then four cycles as follows 95 1C for 30 s , 50 1C for 30 s , 72 1C for 5 min and then 25 cycles as follows 95 1C for 30 s , 60 1C for 30 s and 72 1C for 5 min . The 2208-bp fragment thus obtained was sub-cloned into the pcDNA4 myc-Hys Invitrogen XhoI�EcoRV-linearized vector , upstream from the Myc tags . Drp1 K38A was generated through site-directed mutagenesis of pcDNA4-Myc-Drp1 by using a QuikChange II Site-directed Mutagenesis kit Stratagene , La Jolla , CA , USA . The endogenous Drp1 stop codon was removed using the following primers 50-GGAGACTCATCTTTGGTCCTCGAGTCTAGAGGGCCCG-30 sense and 50-CGGGCCCTCTAGACTCGAGGACCAAAGATGAGTCTCC-30 antisense . The second mutagenesis step to obtain Drp1 K38A was performed using the following primers 50-GGGAACGCAGAGCAGCGGAGCGAGCTCAGTG-30 sense and 50-CACTGAGCTCGCTCCGCTGCTCTGCGTTCCC-30 antisense . The con-structs were sequence-verified using a Big Dye Terminator Sequencing kit version 3.1 Applied Biosystems , Foster City , CA , USA run on an Applied Biosystems ABI 3100 Avant Genetic Analyzer . To obtain the constructs pEYFP-N1-Drp1 and pEYFP-N1-Drp1K38A , the original OriGene construct was digested with NotI and the DrpI fragment was sub-cloned in NotI-linearized pEYFP-N1 Invitrogen downstream from YFP. Site-specific mutagenesis was performed first to remove a stop codon in the EYFP sequence using the following primers 50-CTCGGCATGGACGAGCTGTACAAGAGCAAGG CCGCGAATTC-30 sense and 50-GAATTCGCGGCCTTGCTCTTGTACAGCTCG TCCATGCCGAG-30 antisense . Drp1 K38A was finally obtained with a second mutagenesis step as described above . The final constructs were verified by sequencing , as described above . Cell transfections were performed with the FuGENE HD reagent Roche Diagnostics , Rotkreuz , Switzerland according to the manufacturer�s instructions . The cells were used 24 h after transfection in the various experimental settings described . To silence nNOS we used the �ON-TARGETplus SMARTpool siRNA� system developed by Thermo Scientific Dharmacon Laboratories Lafayette , CO , USA in which silencing is obtained by transfection of 40 nM of a pool of four different siRNAs . The nNOS-silencing siRNAs used in the pool were 5�-AGAUCGACAGCUUUG GUGG-3� 5�-AAUGACGUUGGGUUGGAUC-3� 5�-UUGGAUAAGGCCGCUCUGC - 3� 5�-GAUUCCUGUGUCUUUCAUC-3�. Transfections were performed using the INTERFERIN polyplus transfection reagent from Euroclone Euroclone Siziano PV . Immunoblotting . The extracted proteins 50 mg were separated by 4�12 % sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis SDS-PAGE NuPAGE Invitrogen and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes Perkin Elmer , Waltham , MA , USA as described.46 The membranes were probed using the following antibodies Abs anti-calnexin 1 5000 Genetex Inc , San Antonio , TX , USA anti-Mfn2 1 200 Abnova , Taipei , Taiwan anti-Mfn1 1 200 , Abnova anti Drp1 1 1000 BD Transduction Laboratories anti-COX-IV oxidative phosphorylation Complex-IV subunit-IV , 1 400 Ibridoma Bank Iowa City , Iowa anti-Myc 1 1000 Cell Signaling , Boston , MA , USA anti-Myo-D 1 500 Ibridoma Bank Iowa City , Iowa anti-sarcomeric myosin MyHC 1 10 Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank anti myogenin 1 10 Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank anti Mef2A 1 500 Santa Cruz Biotechnology anti-GAPDH AbD Serotec , Oxford , UK and anti-Opa1 1 1000 BD Transduction Laboratories . Assay of NOS activity . The time course of NOS activity was assayed in intact cells by measuring the conversion of L- [ 3H ] -arginine into L- [ 3H ] -citrulline.46 In brief , the reaction was performed using 145 mM NaCl , 5 mM KCl , 1 mM MgSO4 , 10 mM glucose , 1 mM CaCl2 and 10 mM HEPES pH 7.4 . A mix of 10 mCi ml L- [ 3H ] -arginine and 10 mM cold arginine was added at various time points and the reaction was stopped after 5 min by washing with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline PBS supplemented with 5 mM L-arginine and 4 mM EDTA . A 0.5-ml volume of 100 % cold ethanol was added to the dishes and left to evaporate before a final addition of 20 mM HEPES pH 6.0 . L-NAME-treated cells were run in parallel as a control for specificity . L- [ 3H ] -citrulline was separated from L- [ 3H ] -arginine by DOWEX 50X8-400 chromatography . The L- [ 3H ] -citrulline formed was normalized to protein content , which was evaluated by the bicinchoninic acid procedure BCA Perbio , Bezons , France . Measurement of cGMP generation . At each time point myogenic precursor cell cultures were incubated for 30 min at 37 1C either in growth medium or in differentiation medium with 0.5 mM of the phosphodiesterase inhibitor 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine , supplemented with 1 mM L-NAME , or a vehicle.46 The reaction was terminated by rapid removal of the medium and washing with ice-cold PBS . The cells were lysed by addition of ice-cold trichloroacetic acid final concentration 6 % . After ether extraction , cGMP levels were measured using a radioimmunoassay kit and normalized to protein content . Confocal and time-lapse microscopy . For confocal z-axis stacks of the mitochondrial network , coverslips were placed on the stage of an UltraVIEW ERS Spinning-Disk Confocal microscope equipped with a stage incubator OkoLab , Quarto , ITALY and an EM-CCD Hamamatsu Hamamatsu City , Shizuoka , Japan C9100 , allowing us to follow highly dynamic processes . Cells expressing mtDsRed47 were excited using the 514-nm line of an HeNe laser with exposure times of 100 ms using a 63 immersion objective . Stacks of 20 images , separated by 1 mm along the z-axis , were acquired for steady-state and time-resolved 3D imaging . The total acquisition time for each stack was 1.1 s for the 20 planes to minimize reconstruction artifacts caused by mitochondrial movement . Reconstruction of the stacks was performed using the Volocity software . For confocal imaging of fixed cells , 16-mm-diameter round coverslips were placed on the stage of a Leica TCS SP2 Laser-Scanning Confocal microscope equipped with an electronically controlled and freely definable Acousto-Optical Beam Splitter . Images were acquired with 63 magnification oil-immersion lenses at 1024 1024 pixel resolution . The cells were excited with the 543-nm line for mtDsRed and the emitted light was collected with 570 long-pass filters . Morphometric analyses were performed using imagetool 3.0 University of Texas Health Science Center , San Antonio , USA . Images of cells expressing mitoGFP or mitoDsRed47 were thresholded by using the automatic threshold function . For each identified object , the major-axis length and the roundness index were calculated . Cells were scored with elongated mitochondria when 450 % of the objects in the image i.e. , mitochondria had a major axis longer than 5 mm and a roundness index below 0.5 maximum value is 1 . Serial images z-stacks of mitoDsRed-expressing myogenic cells were acquired with a Leica TCS SP2 Laser-Scanning Confocal microscope and collected with a z-step of 0.5 mm . Image analysis and processing was performed with the public domain software MBF_ImageJ for Microscopy http www.macbiophotonics.ca index.htm .

The cells were lysed in a radio-immunoprecipitation buffer supplemented with a protease inhibitor mixture Sigma and a phosphatase inhibitor mixture Sigma . Myc-Drp1 was immunoprecipitated using an anti-Myc monoclonal Ab 9E10 immobilized on agarose beads Invitrogen . The immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and 32P-labeled Drp1 was visualized by autoradiography using Amersham Hyperfilm MP GE Healthcare . High-resolution respirometry . The respiration rate of the myogenic precursor cells transfected with pEYFP-N1 Drp1 K38A or the empty vector , differentiated for 6 h and treated with ODQ for 1 h , was measured using two-channel titration injection respirometers Oroboros , Instruments Oroboros , Innsbruck , Austria 55 at 37 1C in a buffer containing 0.5 mM EGTA , 3 mM MgCl2 60 mM K-lactobionate , 20 mM taurine , 10 mM KH2PO4 , 20 mM HEPES , 110 mM sucrose and 1 g l bovine serum albumin . Before each experiment the medium was equilibrated with air in the oxygraph chambers at 37 1C until a stable signal was obtained for oxygen calibration .

20489726	N Berndt1,4 , H Yang1,4 , B Trinczek1 , S Betzi1 , Z Zhang2 , B Wu2 , NJ SM Sebti* , 1 www.nature.com cdd The Ser Thr-specific protein kinase Akt was discovered in 19911�3 and has since emerged as an important promoter of tumor cell survival , proliferation as well as migration and invasion.4,5 In mammals , Akt is represented by three isoforms , which share 74 % amino acid sequence identity . Despite this high degree of homology , Akt isoforms may have distinct roles in development and normal physiology . For example , targeted gene deletions in mice have shown that loss of Akt1 function results in smaller body size and significant growth defects.6,7 Mice lacking Akt2 are unable to maintain glucose homeostasis and are diabetic , 8 whereas Akt3 knockout mice have smaller brains but are otherwise normal.9 For activity , Akt requires recruitment to the plasmamembrane and subsequent phosphorylation at two critical sites , T308 and S473 . These events are initiated by growth factors binding to their receptors , which activate phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase PI3K to convert phosphatidylinositol 4,5 -bisphosphate PIP2 to phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5 -trisphosphate PIP3 . PIP3 recruits pleckstrin homology PH domain-containing proteins such as Akt to the plasma membrane , where it is phosphorylated at T308 by phosphoinositide-dependent Lawrence1 , M Pellecchia2 , E Schonbrunn1 , � JQ Cheng3 and kinase 1 PDK1 .10 To be fully active , Akt also needs to be phosphorylated at S473 . This site is phosphorylated by several kinases including DNA-dependent protein kinase DNA-PK 11,12 and mammalian target of rapamycin mTOR complex 2 mTORC2 .13 Whereas mTORC2-mediated phos-phorylation of S473 occurs at the membrane in response to growth factors , 13 DNA-PK phosphorylates S473 in the nucleus in response to DNA damage.11,12 Whether phosphorylation at T308 and S473 in vivo occurs in a specific order is still controversial , 5 but in vitro , T308 and S473 can be phosphory-lated independently.14 Whereas the tumor suppressor phos-phatase and tensin homologue PTEN antagonizes Akt signaling by dephosphorylating phosphoinositides , thereby preventing the activation of PDK1 and Akt , the mechanisms that directly terminate Akt signaling are not well characterized . pT308 is probably dephosphorylated by PP2A15 and pS473 dephosphorylation may involve PP116 and or novel PP2C-like phosphatases termed PHLPP1 and 2.17 The PI3K PTEN Akt pathway is very frequently deregulated in human cancer , leading to persistent hyperphosphorylation� hyperactivation of Akt . This can be due to persistent activation of receptor tyrosine kinases , activating mutations in PI3K , inactivating mutations or deletion of PTEN , 18,19 overexpression of Akt20,21 or a transforming and rare Akt mutation E17K .22 Nonetheless , the specific roles of Akt isoforms in tumorigenesis are poorly understood . For instance , Akt1 is persistently activated in many cancers , and loss of Akt1 expression by antisense oligonucleotides results in inhibition of anchorage-independent growth and induction of apoptosis.23 Overexpres-sion of Akt2 , but not Akt1 or Akt3 , results in an increase of PI3K-dependent invasion and metastasis of breast and ovarian cancer cells.24 Increased Akt3 expression and loss of PTEN result in the development of melanoma , and Akt3 siRNA stimulates apoptosis and inhibits melanoma development.25 Akt contributes to malignant transformation and or tumor progression by acting on many substrates for recent reviews see refs . 4,26�28 including IKKa , Bad , caspase-9 and forkhead transcription factors . Intriguingly , Akt phosphorylates Mdm2 , thereby stimulating the subsequent degradation of p53 . Furthermore , Akt has a direct role in promoting cell-cycle progression by phosphorylating p21Cip1 and p27Kip1 . Also , when growth factors are present , Akt can inhibit TSC1 2 , eventually causing stimulation of mTOR , an important kinase that stimulates cell growth through promoting protein synthesis through ribosomal protein S6 kinase . Because Akt is intimately involved in mediating many of the hallmarks of cancer , Akt has become a major anticancer drug target.18,19,29,30 Recently , we have discovered an Akt phosphory-lation inhibitor , triciribine TCN and its active metabolite TCN-P , through screening the NCI Diversity Set.31 This compound does not inhibit Akt kinase activity per se , but in whole cells prevents phosphorylation of Akt1 , Akt2 or Akt3.31 Furthermore , TCN does not inhibit PI3K , PDK1 and other protein kinases , but inhibits proliferation , induces apoptosis and inhibits tumor growth in animals much more potently in tumors that contain persistently hyperphosphorylated Akt , suggesting that TCN is a selective Akt activation inhibitor.31 It is important to point out that TCN is a tricyclic nucleoside , 32 which , once inside cells , is phosphorylated to its monophosphate derivative , TCN-P , by adenosine kinase . TCN-P is the active metabolite of TCN , as in cells lacking adenosine kinase it is 5000-fold less active.33 TCN-P is presently undergoing human clinical trials in patients whose tumors have high levels of phosphorylated Akt.34 However , the mechanism by which TCN-P inhibits the phosphorylation of Akt is not known . In this study , using biochemical and cell biological studies , surface plasmon resonance SPR and nuclear magnetic resonance NMR , we show that TCN-P , but not TCN , binds to the PH domain of Akt and prevents its recruitment to the plasma membrane and subsequent phosphorylation at T308 and S473 . We also show that constitutively active Akt mutants , Akt1-T308D S473D and myr-Akt , but not Akt1-E17K , rescue cells from TCN-Peffectssuggestingthat the abilityof TCN-P toinhibit tumor cell growth is due to its ability to prevent Akt phosphorylation . Results TCN-P inhibits in vitro neither Akt kinase activity nor the phosphorylation of purified Akt by PDK1 and mTORC2 . TCN-P inhibits the phosphorylation of Akt in whole cells , suppresses tumor growth and induces apoptosis selectively in tumors that have persistently hyperphosphorylated Akt compared with those that do not.31 This prompted a clinical trial in a population of patients whose tumors contain persis-tently hyperphosphorylated Akt.34 Critical to the clinical development of TCN-P as a targeted agent is to under-stand the biochemical mechanism by which it inhibits the phosphorylation of Akt . We have undertaken several bio-chemical , biophysical and cell biological studies to address this important question . First we determined whether in vitro TCN-P inhibits Akt kinase activity or the ability of PDK1 and mTOR to phosphorylate Akt at T308 and S473 , respectively , the two phosphorylation sites required for full activation of Akt . TCN-P did not inhibit the ability of Akt1 to phosphorylate its substrate glycogen synthase kinase 3 GSK3 -b in vitro Figure 1a . Furthermore , purified PDK1 and immunoprecipitated mTOR readily phosphorylated purified Akt1 at T308 and S473 in vitro , respectively , regardless of whether TCN-P was present in the reaction mixture or not Figure 1b and c . These in vitro results show that TCN-P does not inhibit Akt kinase activity and does not directly interfere with the phosphorylation of Akt by either PDK-1 or mTOR . TCN prevents EGF-mediated Akt recruitment to the plasma membrane . Because TCN-P inhibits the phos-phorylation of Akt in intact cells but not in vitro , we reasoned that a possible mechanism of action of TCN-P could be to prevent the translocation of Akt from the cytosol to the plasma membrane . To explore this possibility , we used two approaches , immunofluorescence and subcellular fractionation western blotting . First , we transfected MDA-MB-468 cells with Myc-tagged Akt1 , starved them , treated them with EGF , TCN or both and processed them for immunofluorescence . A major proportion 69.4 % of vehicle-treated starved MDA-MB-468 cells contained Akt in the cytosol Figure 2a and b . However , these starved MDA-MB-468 cells contained 30.6�5.7 % of Akt in the plasma membrane Figure 2b . Treatment of these starved cells with TCN alone resulted in a decreased amount of cells with Akt in the plasma membrane from 30.6�5.7 to 14.3�3.0 % . In contrast , stimulation with EGF in the absence of TCN resulted in 100 % of the cells with Akt in the plasma membrane . Pretreatment of the cells with TCN before EGF stimulation dramatically reduced the percentage of cells with Akt in the plasma membrane from 100 to 20.0�5.0 % Figure 2a and b . Further , we used subcellular fractionation to confirm these results . Consistent with the immuno-fluorescence data , TCN inhibited the ability of EGF to induce Akt recruitment to the plasma membrane in MDA-MB-468 cells Figure 2c . TCN-P , but not TCN , binds to the PH domain of Akt as shown by SPR . The results described in Figures 1 and 2 suggest that a possible mechanism by which TCN inhibits Akt phosphorylation in intact cells is that TCN-P binds to the PH domain of Akt , thereby preventing its recruitment to the plasma membrane . To explore this possibility , we carried out binding experiments using SPR and NMR with Akt-derived PH domain . First , we determined by SPR whether TCN-P and or TCN bind the PH domain of Akt. Figure 3a shows a typical sensorgram obtained with six TCN-P concentrations 46 nM to 11.1 mM , indicating that TCN-P bound to the PH domain of Akt in a dose-dependent manner . TCN-P bound to the Akt PH domain with a ka of 366 per Ms , a kd of 2.52 10 4 per second and a KD of 690 nM Figure 3a . In contrast , TCN did not bind the Akt PH domain Figure 3b . Figure 3c shows the responses after a contact time of 300 s for TCN-P and TCN as a function of their concentration , further showing that TCN-P , but not TCN , binds to the Akt PH domain . To validate these results , we carried out several control experiments . Table 1 summarizes the kinetic data obtained with several compounds and the Akt-PH domain . As a positive control , we used Akt inhibitor VI , a peptide derived from the TCL1 oncoprotein that was reported to bind the PH domain of Akt , 35 and found in our experiments that Cells it binds the Akt-derived PH domain with a KD of 1.4 mM Table 1 . Furthermore , PIP3 , the plasma membrane lipid that recruits Akt to the plasma membrane , bound the Akt-PH domain with a ka of 4251 per Ms , a kd of 2.05 10 4 per second and a KD of 48 nM Table 1 . 140 RU 100 140 RU 100 RU 50 Table 1 Interactions between TCNP and Akt1-derived PH domain , immobilized through thiol coupling Compound Rexp Rmax ka per Ms kd per s KD TCN-P 80 91 366 0.000252 690nM PIP3 31 186 4251 0.000205 48 nM Akt-I VI 48 422 80 0.000116 1.4 mM Ligand-binding studies by NMR chemical shift mapping reveal that TCN-P , but not TCN , binds Akt-PH domain . To further characterize the binding properties of TCN-P and TCN to the Akt PH domain , we conducted ligand-binding studies using NMR . Chemical shift mapping data suggest that Akt-PH domain residues in the PIP3-binding pocket36,37 were perturbed on complexation with TCN-P , but perturbation also extended outside this region Figure 4a and b , possibly due to some small conformational changes upon binding . For example , G16 , I19 , R23 , R25 and I36 all show chemical shift perturbation . Conversely , no appreciable chemical shift perturbation could be observed with the compound TCN Figure 4a and b . This is consistent with the SPR results and suggests that the presence of the phosphate group is essential for binding see more below . Hence , on the basis of chemical shift mapping studies , we performed molecular docking studies to provide further possible binding poses of TCN-P in the PIP3-binding site of Akt PH domain . A possible binding mode for the compound was obtained using the program GOLD version 2.1 CCDC Software Ltd. , Cambridge , UK and the structure of Akt PH domain PDB code 1H10 .36 The TCN-P-binding site was defined within a 15 A ? radius around the residue K14,36 located at the PIP3-binding site . A total 100 runs were performed and the conformation of TCN-P with the best GOLD score is shown in Figure 4c , along with the binding mode of inositol 1,3,4,5 -tetrakisphosphate IP4 , the well-accepted head group of PIP3 that binds to the Akt PH domain36,37 Figure 4d . For comparison , Figure 4e and f shows space-filling models and the interacting amino-acid residues for both TCN-P and PIP3 . Although ultimately X-ray diffraction studies will be needed to further delineate the intermolecular contacts at the atomic level , the docking pose obtained further suggests that TCN-P partially mimics the binding interactions provided by PIP3 . Indeed , in the docking models , the phosphate of TCN-P is positioned at the location of the D3 phosphate of PIP3 and is surrounded by the residues K14 , R23 , R25 and N53 Figure 4e and f . These are the same residues that have been shown to interact with the D3 phosphate of PIP3 in the crystal structure of Akt PH domain and PIP3.36 Furthermore , the five-membered sugar ring of TCN-P Figure 4c and e can almost be superimposed to the six-membered ring of PIP3 Figure 4d and f . Constitutively active Akt1-T308D S473D and myr-Akt1 but not Akt1-E17K rescue from TCN-mediated inhibition of Akt activation , loss of cell viability and induction of apoptosis . The results from Figures 1�4 show that TCN-P binds to the PH domain of Akt and inhibits its recruitment to the plasma membrane , and suggest this as a mechanism by which TCN treatment of cells inhibits Akt phosphorylation and subsequent activation . If this is the case , we reasoned that an Akt mutant that no longer requires recruitment to the plasma membrane and activation by phosphorylation would be resistant to TCN-P , and rescues cells from TCN-P-mediated inhibition of proliferation and induction of apoptosis . To evaluate this possibility , we stably expressed in COS-7 cells either Myc-tagged wild-type Akt1 or Myc-tagged Akt1-T308D S473D Akt1-DD , a constitutively active Akt mutant that does not require plasma membrane binding or phosphorylation at T308 and S473 for activation . Both wild-type Akt1-and Akt1-DD - , but not the vector-transfected cells , expressed the Myc-tagged Akt proteins Figure 5a , left panel . First , we determined whether the Akt1-DD kinase activity in intact cells is resistant to TCN . To this end , we treated wild-type Akt1 and Akt1-DD stably expressing cells with TCN , immunoprecipitated Akt with Myc antibody and PPM ? 0.06 assayed in vitro the Akt1 kinase activity with GSK3-b as substrate . TCN resulted in dose-dependent inhibition of wild-type Akt1 but not Akt1-DD kinase activity Figure 5a , right panel . In addition to Akt1-DD , we used two other constitutively active mutants of Akt . The first is myristoylated Akt1 myr-Akt1 , which does not require its PH domain for plasma membrane recruitment . The other mutant of Akt is the naturally occurring , transforming mutant Akt1-E17K , which requires the PH domain for plasma membrane recruitment . As expected , in the absence of EGF , cells expressing wild-type Akt1 had much lower levels of phospho-Akt than those expressing either Akt1-E17K or myr-Akt1 , whereas cells expressing Akt1-DD had no detectable phospho-Akt Figure 5b . Upon stimulation with EGF , wild-type phospho-Akt levels increased and TCN treatment decreased these wild-type phospho-Akt levels . TCN also inhibited the phospho-Akt levels in cells expressing Akt1-E17K , but to a lesser degree . In contrast , TCN had no TCN ? M 0 1 3 10 30 0 1 3 10 30 pAkt S473 Vinculin effect on phospho-Akt levels in cells expressing myr-Akt1 . Furthermore , TCN inhibited endogenous phospho-GSK3-b in cells expressing wild-type Akt1 , but not Akt1-DD or myr-Akt1 . TCN inhibited phospho-GSK3-b in Akt1-E17K expressing cells , but to a lesser degree Figure 5b . We next determined the effect of TCN treatment for 24h on the proliferation of these same cells by MTT assay . Cells transfected with vector TCN ? M alone were not sensitive to TCN Figure 5c . Because these cells have virtually undetectable levels of phospho-Akt Figure 5d , this is in agreement with our previous report showing that human cancer cells low in phospho-Akt levels are less sensitive to TCN than those with high phospho-Akt levels.31 Stable expression of wild-type Akt1 rendered these cells sensitive to TCN . However , both the constitutively active mutants , Akt1-DD and myr-Akt1 , rescued these cells from TCN-mediated inhibition of viability , whereas cells expressing Akt1-E17K were sensitive toward TCN , but not as sensitive as those expressing wild-type Akt1 . Thus , Akt1-DD and myr-Akt1 are resistant to TCN and rescue from TCN effects . Consistent with these results , TCN treatment of cells expressing vector , Akt1-DD or myr-Akt1 failed to induce any noticeable caspase-3 activity , whereas cells expressing wild-type Akt1 showed a 2-to 11-fold activation of caspase-3 in response to TCN . Furthermore , in cells expressing Akt1-E17K , TCN activated caspase-3 by up to fourfold Figure 5e . Taken together , these results suggest that TCN-induced apoptosis depends on its ability to prevent Akt phosphorylation . Discussion The PI3K PTEN Akt pathway is one of the most frequently deregulated pathways in human cancer . This justifies the need for potent and specific inhibitors capable of down-regulating Akt . Targeting Akt directly would also be expected to neutralize malfunctions due to overexpression or activating mutations of PI3K and nonfunctional PTEN , which are often responsible for Akt hyperactivation . We have recently identified a compound , TCN , that has antitumor activity selectively in tumor cells that contain persistently hyperphos-phorylated Akt compared with those tumors that do not.31 Because TCN does not inhibit Akt kinase activity in vitro , but prevents the phosphorylation of Akt in intact cells , TCN is thought to function as an Akt activation inhibitor rather than an Akt inhibitor , but its precise mechanism of action remains to be determined . As Akt regulation is complex see introduction , in theory several strategies exist to inhibit Akt , such as 1 direct inhibition of Akt enzyme activity , 2 inhibition of Akt phosphorylation , 3 activation of Akt dephosphorylation or 4 prevention of Akt translocation to the plasma membrane , which is a prerequisite for the critical phosphorylations at T308 and S473 . In this article , we provide evidence that TCN functions primarily through the latter mechanism . Using SPR and NMR see Figures 3 and 4 , we have shown that TCN-P , which is known to be the active metabolite of TCN inside cells , 33 can directly bind to the PH domain of Akt1 or Akt2 . In contrast , TCN did not bind , demonstrating that the phosphate group is important for binding . The fact that TCN-P , but not TCN , binds to the PH domain of Akt supports our proposed mechanism of TCN-P competing with PIP3 and preventing Akt membrane binding . This is consistent with previous reports showing that cells unable to convert TCN to TCN-P are highly resistant to TCN.33 Furthermore , our NMR studies also showed that TCN-P , but not TCN , interacted with amino acids that are involved in PIP3 binding , which is in agreement with molecular docking studies suggesting that the Akt-PH domain PIP3-binding site can accommodate TCN-P . For example , TCN-P , but not TCN , caused chemical shifts perturbation in Akt-PH domain amino acids known to be involved in PIP3 binding . Furthermore , molecular docking shows that the phosphate group of TCN-P occupies the binding pocket of the D3 phosphate in PIP3 involving residues K14 , R23 , R25 and N53 of the Akt-PH domain . Finally , the sugar ring of TCN-P occupies the binding site of the six-membered ring of PIP3 . Collectively , the results of SPR and NMR experiments , combined with computational docking studies , explain why TCN-P did not prevent the phosphory-lation of Akt by either PDK1 or mTOR in vitro Figure 1 , but TCN prevented the translocation of Akt to the plasma membrane following EGF stimulation in intact starved cells Figure 2 . This is most likely due to TCN-P preventing PIP3 from recruiting Akt to the plasma membrane , possibly by either competing with PIP3 for binding to the Akt PH domain or binding to an adjacent pocket that induces conformational changes preventing PIP3 binding . The behavior of the two mutants , Akt1-DD and myr-Akt1 , supports this interpretation . Figure 5 shows that these forms of Akt1 do not depend on growth-factor-dependent phosphory-lation for activation and suggests neither Akt1-DD nor myr-Akt1 depend on growth factor-dependent recruitment to the plasmamembraneor on membrane-associatedphosphory-lation . Therefore , both Akt1-DD and myr-Akt1 are consti-tutively active . Interestingly , ectopic expression of wild-type Akt1 conferred TCN sensitivity to COS-7 cells Figure 5c and e . This is consistent with previous data that showed that parental NIH 3T3 cells are resistant to TCN whereas Akt2-overexpressing NIH 3T3 cells are sensitive to TCN.31 This is also consistent with the observation that human cancer cells with low phospho-Akt levels OVCAR5 , DU-145 , T47D , Colo357 , WM852 are much less sensitive than human cancer cells with high levels of phospho-Akt OVCAR3 , OVCAR8 , PANC1 , LNCaP , PC-3 , MDA-MB-468 , WM35 .31 In contrast , Akt1-DD was no longer phosphorylated at T308 or S473 and its ability to phosphorylate the Akt substrate GSK3-b was resistant to TCN . Similarly , in cells expressing myr-Akt1 , TCN was unable to inhibit Akt1 phosphorylation at S473 or to inhibit phosphorylation of GSK3-b . In agreement with the failure of TCN to affect Akt phosphorylation and kinase activity , cells that express these constitutively active Akt mutants were resistant to TCN-induced loss of viability and apoptosis . These data support the notion that the mechanism by which TCN inhibits tumor survival and growth is by preventing the phosphorylation of Akt . Furthermore , cells expressing the transforming mutant Akt1-E17K were less sensitive to TCN-induced inhibition of Akt and were also less sensitive to TCN inhibition of proliferation and induction of apoptosis . A possible explanation for the reduced sensitivity of this mutant is that replacement of a negative with a positive charge associated with the E-to-K mutation in position 17 is predicted to result in tighter binding of Akt1-E17K to the phospholipids of the plasma membrane.22 Therefore , this would slightly reduce , but not abolish the ability of TCN to interfere with the function of Akt1-E17K . In summary , our study data have delineated a mechanism of action for the anticancer drug and chemical probe TCN-P . This small molecule appears to function primarily by binding to the PH domain of Akt and preventing the recruitment of Akt to the cell membrane , where this protein is normally activated by phosphorylation . Our study results also support a mechanism of antitumor activity of TCN-P that involves inhibition of Akt phosphorylation , and suggest that in future TCN-P clinical trials , it would be important to evaluate the levels of phospho-Akt as a biomarker for TCN-P activity in patients whose tumors have high levels of phospho-Akt .

As a template , we used human Myc-tagged wild-type Akt1 accession number NM_001014431.1 . Myr-Akt1 was prepared as described previously.38 The DNA sequences of the wild-type and mutant cDNAs encoding the recombinant constructs were validated by our Molecular Biology Core Facility and were found to be correct . In vitro phosphorylation assays . The effect of TCN on the phosphorylation of Akt or the kinase activity of Akt was essentially determined in two ways by using either purified recombinant proteins or lysates or proteins immunoprecipitated from cells transfected with recombinant Akt . Nonradioactive in vitro Akt kinase assay was performed in the presence of 200 mM ATP with GSK-3b as a substrate according to the manufacturer�s instructions Cell Signaling , except that we used Myc antibody instead of immobilized Akt antibody to immunoprecipitate Akt . To assess phosphorylation of Akt by PDK1 , we incubated human recombinant inactive Akt1 30 ng with PDK1 100 ng in the presence of 200 mM ATP for the indicated time at 301C in a buffer consisting of 5 mM MOPS pH 7.2 , 2.5 mM b-glycerophosphate , 1 mM EGTA , 0.4 mM EDTA , 5 mM MgCl2 and 0.05 mM DTT . The reaction was terminated by adding 8 ml of 4 SDS sample buffer to 30 ml of the reaction mixture and heating at 951C for 5 min . Samples were subjected to 10 % SDS-PAGE . Phosphorylation at T308 and S473 was monitored by subsequent western blotting with the phosphorylation site-specific antibodies and developed using Chemiluminescence reagents PerkinElmer , Boston , MA , USA . For in vitro kinase assays following exposure of cells to TCN , we transfected cells with vector , myc-wt-Akt1 , myc-Akt1-DD or myc-Akt1-E17K using LipofectAMINE-2000 . COS-7 cells stably transfected with these Akt1 constructs were selected by G418 Sigma . Myr-Akt1 was transiently transfected into COS-7 cells . The phosphorylation of Akt at S473 was assayed with immunoprecipitated mTOR as described by Sarbassov et al.39 with slight modifications .

Immunoprecipitates were washed four times with the above lysis buffer , followed by two washes with the mTOR kinase buffer 25 mM HEPES pH 7.5 , 100 mM potassium acetate , 1 mM MgCl2 . Immunoprecipitates were incubated in 30 ml of the mTOR kinase buffer containing 300 ng inactive Akt1 and 500 mM ATP at 371C . The reaction was stopped by the addition of 8 ml of 4 SDS sample buffer , and analysis of Akt phosphorylation by western blotting was performed as described above . Immunofluorescence analyses of Akt1 membrane localization and phosphorylation .

Fluorescence was observed using a Zeiss Axiovert Upright Fluorescent microscope Gottingen , � Germany with a 60 oil-immersion lens . For each experiment , approximately 100 Akt1-expressing cells were scored to quantify membrane localization of Akt1 . We scored as positive for Myc-Akt1 membrane localization those cells whose perimeter showed a brightly red stain that was distinctly set apart from the nuclear blue DAPI stain . Results are presented as percentage of membrane-positive cells per total Akt1-expressing cells . Each bar represents the mean of three experiments�S.D. To assess Akt phosphorylation at S473 , we used Akt antibody and phospho-Akt S473 193H12 Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated secondary antibody , using similar procedures as described above .

Large cell debris was pelleted by centrifugation at 2000 g for 5 min at 41C . The supernatants were centrifuged at 100 000 g for 20 min at 41C . The resulting supernatant cytosol was collected , and the pellet was washed once with hypotonic lysis buffer , then resuspended in hypotonic lysis buffer containing 1 % Triton X-100 . The lysate was again centrifuged at 100 000 g for 20 min at 41C , and the supernatant membrane was collected . The distribution of proteins in the cytosol and membrane fractions was analyzed by western blotting . Surface plasmon resonance .

Akt1-derived PH domain 100 mg ml 100 mM sodium phosphate , pH 6.0 was immobilized on the active surface by ligand thiol coupling , which engages SH groups in the protein . In this case , a reference surface was prepared by �blank immobilization� . All kinetic affinity experiments were carried out at 251C with at least five analyte concentrations as well as solvent alone which served as a blank with a flow rate of 30 ml min . The contact time was typically X3 min and the dissociation time was X6 min . All curves and diagrams shown are reference and blank subtracted . Compounds were prepared in running buffer , which was either PBS for TCN-P , PIP3 and Akt inhibitor VI or PBS containing 1 % dimethylsulfoxide DMSO , for TCN . For each immobilization , a theoretical maximal response Rmax was calculated for all compounds according to the formula Rmax ? MWcompound MWprotein RI , where MW ? molecular weight and RI ? immobilization level . Nuclear magnetic resonance . Human Akt2 protein fragment encom-passing residues 1�118 was cloned into the expression vector pGEX2T and transfected into E. coli . Uniformly 15 N-labeled protein was produced by growing the expression strain in the M9 medium with 15N NH4Cl as the sole nitrogen source . The protein was purified using GST affinity chromatography and then cleaved with thrombin . The resulting protein product has two extra amino-acid residues GS at the N terminus .

20489727	Interstitial lung disease ILD , in particular interstitial pneu-monia associated with pulmonary fibrosis , is a devastating chronic lung condition with poor prognosis . Pulmonary fibrosis progresses insidiously and slowly , with acute exacerbation of interstitial pneumonia being a highly lethal clinical event . Furthermore , the mortality rate for pulmonary fibrosis is increasing.1,2 Although most cases of pulmonary fibrosis are idiopathic , some are due to drug side effects drug-induced pulmonary fibrosis . For example , the antitumor drugs imatinib and gefitinib , as well as the antirheumatoid arthritis drugs leflunomide and methotrexate , are known to induce ILD pulmonary fibrosis . This is cause for serious clinical concern , as it can lead to patient death , thereby restricting the therapeutic use of these drugs.3�5 Unfortunately , the etiology of drug-induced ILD pulmonary fibrosis is not yet understood and , as a result , an appropriate animal model has not yet been established . Although the bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis animal model mimics some characteristics of human pulmonary fibrosis , 6 it remains unclear whether drugs known to induce ILD clinically exacerbate bleomycin-induced effects . Therefore , understanding the mechanism governing drug-induced ILD pulmonary fibrosis and developing a viable animal model are important to establish not only a clinical protocol for its treatment but also an assay system that will facilitate screening to eliminate candidate drugs with the potential to produce this type of side effect . It is now believed that pulmonary fibrosis is induced by repeated epithelial cell damage and abnormal wound repair and remodeling , resulting in abnormal deposition of extra-cellular matrix ECM proteins , such as collagen . Cytokines , in particular transforming growth factor TGF -b1 , have been reported to have an important role in pulmonary fibrosis.7 Inflammation , particularly that mediated by TGF-b1 and reactive oxygen species is involved in repeated lung epithelial cell damage.8 On the other hand , an increase in lung myofibroblasts has been suggested to have an important role in abnormal wound repair and remodeling.9 Myofibroblasts extensively produce and secrete ECM proteins , 9 and are involved in abnormal wound repair and remodeling through various mechanisms , including deregulation of the balance between matrix metallopeptidases MMPs and tissue inhibi-tors of MMPs TIMPs .10 It was previously believed that the origin of myofibroblasts is solely peribronchiolar and perivas-cular fibroblasts that transdifferentiate to myofibroblasts in response to various stimuli , in particular TGF-b1.11 However , recently , it was shown that lung epithelial cells undergo epithelial�mesenchymal transition EMT to become myofibro-blasts after treatment with TGF-b1 in vitro.12,13 The EMT of lung epithelial cells also seems to be induced in the lungs of pulmonary fibrosis patients and bleomycin-treated ani-mals.12,14 Furthermore , inhibition of EMT by knockout of the integrin-a3 gene has been shown to suppress bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis in mice.15 These results suggest that some of the lung myofibroblasts in pulmonary fibrosis patients originate from lung epithelial cells through the EMT , and that EMT has an important role in the pathogenesis of the condition , including that induced by drugs . However , the involvement of EMT in drug-induced pulmonary fibrosis has not previously been examined . Leflunomide , one of a number of newly developed disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs , 16,17 suppresses the cell-cycle progression of T lymphocytes and other types of cells by inhibiting mitochondrial dihydroorotate dehydrogenase DHODH , which is the fourth enzyme in the de novo synthesis of pyrimidine.18 This mechanism is supported by the obser-vation that the inhibitory effect of leflunomide on cell growth is canceled by supplementing the cultures with exogenous uridine , which is a substrate of the salvage pathway of pyrimidine synthesis.18 Postmarketing surveillance for all patients prescribed with leflunomide in Japan showed that 80 of 5911 patients developed interstitial pneumonia and that , of these , 27 died , with ILD being judged to be the primary cause of death in at least 18 cases . The incidence of leflunomide-induced ILD and its mortality rate are higher than the corresponding figures in Western countries 16,17,19,20 however , the mechanism governing this racial difference for susceptibility to drug-induced ILD is unknown . In this study , we examined the EMT-inducing abilities of drugs known to cause ILD clinically . Our results showed that A771726 , an active metabolite of leflunomide , induces EMT-like phenotypes in cultured human type II alveolar A549 cells through the inhibition of DHODH . We also provide evidence that administration of leflunomide stimulates bleomycin-induced EMT-like phenomenon in the pulmonary tissue and exacerbates bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis . On the basis of these findings , we consider that leflunomide-induced pulmonary fibrosis involves EMT of lung epithelial cells and that this leflunomide-dependent exacerbation of bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis provides a suitable animal model of drug-induced ILD . Results Induction of EMT-like phenotypes by an active meta - bolite of leflunomide in vitro . We first set out to examine the in vitro EMT-inducing abilities of drugs known , to induce ILD clinically . As one of the phenotypes related to EMT is growth inhibition , 21 we initially determined the concentration of each drug A771726 an active metabolite of leflunomide , amiodarone , methotrexate , imatinib and gefitinib that led to the suppression of A549 cell growth Supplementary Figure S1a . Upregulation of the expression of myofibroblast marker proteins such as a-smooth muscle actin a-SMA and collagen I and downregulation of the expression of epithelial cell marker proteins such as E-cadherin and precursor of surfactant protein C proSP-C can be used to monitor EMT . Treatment of cells with A771726 or methotrexate upregulated the expression of a-sma and col1a1 one of the genes for collagen I mRNAs , and down-regulated E-cadherin mRNA expression Supplementary Figure S1b . The other drugs tested amiodarone , imatinib and gefitinib did not significantly affect the expression of these genes , except for the downregulation of E-cadherin mRNA expression by gefitinib Supplementary Figure S1b . Immunoblotting analysis showed that protein expression of a-SMA or proSP-C and E-cadherin was increased or decreased , respectively , in the presence of A771726 or methotrexate Supplementary Figure S1c . As these results suggested that both A771726 and methotrexate can induce EMT in A549 cells , we took into consideration the plasma concentrations of these two drugs at clinical doses see discussion , before selecting A771726 for further experiments . As shown in Figure 1a and b , the change in the expression of EMT-related genes proteins was dependent on the dose of A771726 . Immunostaining analysis showed that treatment of A549 cells with A771726 reduced the expression of E-cadherin at the cell periphery and induced the expression of a-SMA in the cytosol Figure 1c . We also examined the effect of A771726 on EMT-like phenotypes in primary cultured rat alveolar epithelial cells . As shown in Figure 2a�c , A771726-dependent upregulation or downregulation of the expression of a-SMA and collagen or E-cadherin and proSP-C , respectively , was also observed in primary cultured rat alveolar epithelial cells , although such alteration was observed with lower concentration of A771726 in primary cultured rat alveolar epithelial cells than in A549 cells . We also examined the effect of A771726 on other EMT-related phenotypes , including an increase in cell migration activity and the activity and expression of MMPs and TIMPs . As shown in Figure 1d , treatment of cells with A771726 stimulated the migration activity of A549 cells . The band intensity based on gelatin zymography , indicative of MMP-2 and MMP-9 activity , was also increased by treatment of cells with A771726 Figure 1e . The level of TIMP-1 in the culture medium increased in the presence of A771726 Figure 1f Furthermore , the expression of mmp-2 , mmp-9 and timp-1 mRNAs was upregulated Figure 1g . Taken together , these findings support the idea that A771726 induces EMT in A549 cells . Involvement of Smad-interacting protein 1 and the Notch-signaling pathway in A771726-induced EMT-like phenotypes . A number of transcription factors such as Snail , Twist , Smad-interacting protein 1 SIP1 and Slug are involved in the induction of EMT.22 As shown in Figure 3a , treatment of cells with A771726 upregulated mRNA expression of SIP1 and Slug and , to a lesser extent , Twist . A771726-dependent upregulation of expression of SIP1 and Slug was also observed at the protein level Figure 3b . Thus , we tested the contribution of SIP1 to A771726-induced EMT-like phenotypes using its siRNA unfortunately , we could not obtain siRNA that efficiently suppresses the expression of Slug . Transfection of SIP1 siRNA suppressed the expression of sip1 mRNA and SIP1 protein in both the presence and the absence of A771726 treatment Figure 3c and d . This transfection partially suppressed the A771726-induced upregulation of a-SMA expression and the downregulation of E-cadherin and proSP-C expression Figure 3c and d , suggesting that the upregulation of SIP1 expression is at least partly involved in A771726-induced EMT-like phenotypes . A771726-dependent upregulation of expression of SIP1 was also observed in primary cultured rat alveolar epithelial cells Figure 2d and e . It has also been reported that TGF-b1 upregulates the expression of EMT-related transcription factors , including SIP1.23,24 However , as shown in Supplementary Figure S2a and b , A771726 did not significantly affect the mRNA expression of TGF-b1 or the level of TGF-b1 in the culture medium . Furthermore , LY364947 , an inhibitor for TGF-b receptor kinase , suppressed the changes in the expression of a-SMA , E-cadherin and proSP-C in the presence of TGF-b1 but not A771726 Supplementary Figure S2c and d . It therefore appears that A771726-induced EMT-like pheno-types do not involve modulation of expression and activity of TGF-b1 . Next , we tested the contribution of the Notch-signaling pathway to A771726-induced EMT-like phenotypes . This pathway , which is triggered by the binding between Notch receptors Notch-1�4 and ligands such as Jagged-1 , 2 and Delta-like 1 Dll-1 , is mediated by two proteolytic cleavage events involving the Notch receptor.25 The second cleavage is catalyzed by g-secretase , leading to secretion of the Notch intracellular domain NICD , which then translocates to the nucleus to promote transcription of downstream genes.26 It was recently reported that activation of the Notch-signaling pathway induces EMT.27,28 As shown in Figure 4a and b , treatment of cells with A771726 upregulated the expression of jagged-1 , 2 , dll-1 and notch-1 , 3 , 4 mRNAs and Jagged-1 and Dll-1 in a dose-dependent manner . Furthermore , the level of NICD in the nuclear extract was increased in the presence of A771726 and this increase was suppressed by cotreatment with an inhibitor of g-secretase , N- [ N-3,5-difluorophenacetyl-L-alanyl ] -S-phenylglycine t-butyl ester DAPT Figure 4c , suggesting that the Notch-signaling pathway is activated by A771726 . To test an idea that the Notch-signaling pathway is involved in A771726-induced EMT-like phenotypes , we examined the effect of DAPT on A771726-induced EMT-like phenotypes . As shown in Figure 4d and e , A771726-induced alterations in the mRNA and protein expression of a-SMA , E-cadherin and SIP1 were partially suppressed by DAPT , suggesting that the Notch-signaling pathway does contribute to A771726-induced EMT-like phenotypes . A771726-depen-dent upregulation of expression of jagged-1 and notch-1 mRNAs and Jagged-1 and NICD was also observed in primary cultured rat alveolar epithelial cells Figures 2d and e . To test whether the inhibition of DHODH is involved in the EMT-inducing activity of A771726 , we first examined the effect of siRNA for DHODH on the expression of EMT-related genes . Transfection of siRNA for DHODH altered the mRNA and protein expression of a-SMA and E-cadherin Figure 5a and b . A number of A771726 analogs have been synthe-sized , and their ability to inhibit DHODH was revealed.29 The DHODH-inhibitory ability of compound 3 is similar to that of A771726 however , that of compound 2 is markedly less , and compound 1 is inert in this context.29 As illustrated in Figure 5d and e , compound 3 induced EMT-like phenotypes to a similar extent to that observed with A771726 . Compound 2 also induced EMT-like phenotypes , but only at a higher concentra-tion , whereas compound 1 had no effect Figure 5d and e . Taken together , these results suggest that A771726 induces EMT-like phenotypes through inhibition of DHODH . We further examined the effect of supplementing the cultures with exogenous uridine . As shown in Figure 6a and b , the addition of uridine to the culture medium suppressed the A771726-induced EMT-like phenotypes . Furthermore , it also suppressed the A771726-induced upregulation of expression of sip1 , notch-1 and jagged-1 mRNAs and SIP1 , NICD and Jagged-1 Figure 6a and b . Uridine-dependent suppression of A771726-induced EMT-like phenotypes was also observed in primary cultured rat alveolar epithelial cells Figure 2f and g . These results further support the notion that A771726 induces EMT-like phenotypes through inhibition of DHODH . We also found that the addition of cytidine suppressed A771726-induced EMT-like phenotypes data not shown . As it is known that uridine and cytidine can be synthesized from each other , 30 it seems that these phenotypes are mediated through depletion of the intracellular pool of pyrimidine . Therefore , we next tested whether the induction of EMT-like phenotypes is specific for inhibition of pyrimidine synthesis or can be observed with inhibition of purine synthesis using 6-mercaptopurine 6-MP , an inhibitor of purine synthesis.30 Treatment of A549 cells with 100 mM 6-MP inhibited cell growth to a similar extent to that observed with 40 mM A771726 data not shown . As shown in Figure 6c , treatment of cells with 100 mM 6-MP upregulated the expression of a-sma mRNA and downregulated the expression of E-cadherin mRNA . However , 6-MP had no effect on the expression of sip1 and notch-1 mRNAs and protein expression of a-SMA , SIP1 , NICD and proSP-C , and downregulated the expression of jagged-1 mRNA and Jagged-1 Figure 6c and d , suggesting that inhibition of pyrimidine synthesis rather than purine synthesis preferentially induces EMT-like phenotypes . Effect of leflunomide on bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis . As described in the �Introduction� section , induction of EMT of lung epithelial cells has an important role in pulmonary fibrosis , with the in vitro results outlined above implicating leflunomide in this process . To investigate this further , we first examined whether EMT is induced in the mouse lung by oral administration of leflunomide alone , finding no significant effect at concentrations of up to 100mg kg data not shown . Next , we tested the idea that leflunomide stimulates EMT-like phenomenon in the presence of other fibrosis-inducing stimuli , such as bleomycin . A once-only at day 0 intratracheal administration of bleomycin 5mg kg induced apparent EMT-like phenomenon 14 days after treatment see below . To examine the effect of leflunomide on the bleomycin-induced EMT-like phenomenon , we used a lower dose of bleomycin 0.5mg kg . Immunoblotting analysis of pulmonary tissues revealed that administration of bleomycin alone at this dose slightly increased or decreased the level of a-SMA or E-cadherin and proSP-C , respectively , an effect that was further stimulated by simultaneous adminis-tration of leflunomide 40mg kg , although the results were not always statistically significant Figure 7a and b . We also measured MMP activity and the level of TIMP-1 by gelatin zymography and ELISA , respectively , and found that these were slightly elevated in response to administration of bleomycin alone , an effect that was further stimulated by simultaneous administration of leflunomide Figure 7c�e , overall suggesting that leflunomide stimulates bleomycin-induced EMT-like phenomenon . To test this idea further , we then used immunohistochem-ical analysis to detect cells with positive expression of both a-SMA and proSP-C , a marker of EMT of lung epithelial cells.14 As shown in Figure 7f and g , a few double-positive cells were detected in lung sections prepared from bleomycin-treated mice this number being dramatically increased by simultaneous administration of leflunomide . Administration of leflunomide alone had no such effect Figure 7f and g . We next measured the pulmonary level of TGF-b1 and found that administration of bleomycin 0.5 mg kg and leflunomide , either alone or in combination had no significant effect Figure 7h . Administration of bleomycin 0.5 mg kg and leflunomide also did not affect the pulmonary level of connective tissue growth factor CTGF Supplementary Figure S3 . We then examined the effect of administration of lefluno-mide on bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis by monitoring histopathological changes and pulmonary hydroxyproline levels an indicator of collagen levels . Histopathological analysis of pulmonary tissue using hematoxylin and eosin staining showed that the simultaneous administration of leflunomide 40 mg kg and bleomycin 0.5 mg kg induced severe pulmonary damage thickened and edematous alveo-lar walls and interstitium , and infiltration of leucocytes Figure 8a . Administration of either leflunomide or bleomycin alone did not cause such clear pulmonary damage Figure 8a . Masson�s trichrome staining of collagen revealed that administration of bleomycin caused slight collagen deposition , an effect , which was greatly exacerbated by simultaneous administration of leflunomide Figure 8b . The pulmonary hydroxyproline level was slightly increased by administration of bleomycin alone , but this effect was further enhanced by simultaneous administration of leflunomide Figure 8c . These results suggest that administration of leflunomide exacerbates bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis . We next examined the effect of leflunomide on the survival of mice treated with bleomycin . As shown in Figure 8d , administration of bleomycin alone caused death , the rate of which was accelerated by simultaneous administration of leflunomide . To test whether leflunomide exacerbates bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis through inhibition of DHODH , we examined the effect of coadministration of uridine . As shown in Figure 9a�c , coadministration of uridine clearly sup-pressed pulmonary tissue damage , collagen deposition and increases in pulmonary hydroxyproline levels observed in mice treated with both bleomycin and leflunomide . We also found a decrease in the number of cells expressing both a-SMA and proSP-C in mice that had been coadministered uridine Figure 9d and e . These findings suggest that the exacerbation of bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis by leflunomide is mediated by its inhibitory effect on DHODH and resulting stimulation of bleomycin-induced EMT-like phenomenon . Discussion Although drug-induced ILD , particularly interstitial pneumonia associated with pulmonary fibrosis , is a serious clinical concern , the molecular mechanism governing this pheno-menon is unknown , leading to the lack of a suitable animal model . Consequently , neither a clinical protocol for the treatment of drug-induced ILD nor an assay system to eliminate candidate drugs with the potential to cause this type of side effect has been established . A number of previous reports have suggested that cytotoxic and allergy-inducing effects of the drugs are involved in drug-induced ILD.3�5,19 In this study , for the first time , we focused on the EMT of lung epithelial cells in a bid to understand the mechanism of drug-induced ILD pulmonary fibrosis . When we examined the EMT-inducing abilities of drugs known to induce ILD clinically , we found that A771726 and methotrexate produced EMT-like phenotypes . The concentration of methotrexate used was much higher than its plasma concentration at a clinical dose approximately 0.01�0.2 mM .31 On the other hand , A771726 induced EMT-like phenotypes at concentrations similar to those obtained in the plasma when administered at therapeutic levels approxi-mately 40�350 mM .32 Thus , we considered that induction of EMT-like phenotypes by A771726 is clinically relevant and investigated the underlying molecular mechanism . Studies on other cell types have shown that A771726 induces apoptosis and diminishes proliferation in myeloma cells33 and inhibits proliferation and collagen synthesis and induces apoptosis in hepatic stellate cells , 34 suggesting that A771726 affects cell physiology differently depending on cell-type species . Among the transcription factors known to induce EMT , we found that both SIP1 and Slug mRNA expression was upregulated by A771726 and that transfection of cells with siRNA for SIP1 partially suppressed the A771726-induced EMT-like phenotypes , suggesting that SIP1 has a role in this phenomenon . However , although it is well known that TGF-b1 induces EMT through transcription factors that include SIP1,23 the lack of involvement of the TGF-b-signaling pathway was suggested by the fact that 1 TGF-b1 ex-pression and the level of TGF-b1 in the culture medium were not affected by A771726 and 2 an inhibitor of the TGF-b-signaling pathway did not affect the A771726-induced EMT-like phenotypes . This led us to investigate the involvement of the Notch-signaling pathway , which has recently been reported to have an important role not only in EMT but also in pulmonary fibrosis.27,35 Expression of some Notch ligands and receptors was upregulated by A771726 , and an inhibitor for this pathway DAPT partially suppressed the A771726-induced EMT-like phenotypes , suggesting the involvement of the Notch-signaling pathway to this phenomenon . Further-more , although it is known that A771726 has various activities other than inhibition of DHODH , including inhibition of tyrosine kinase and cyclooxygenase-2,36,37 we clearly showed that the primary target of A771726 for induction of EMT is DHODH based on the following observations 1 transfection of cells with siRNA for DHODH induced EMT-like phenotypes , 2 among the A771726 analogs , the ability to induce EMT-like phenotypes correlated with the ability to inhibit DHODH and 3 the addition of uridine to the culture medium completely suppressed the A771726-induced EMT-like phenotypes . However , how inhibition of DHODH causes EMT remains unclear . We found that administration of leflunomide alone did not induce EMT-like phenomenon in mouse lung . As one of the risk factors for leflunomide-induced ILD is preexisting pulmonary fibrosis , 20,38 we hypothesized that leflunomide stimu-lates EMT-like phenotypes in the presence of other fibrosis-inducing stimuli . In fact , we found that the administration of leflunomide stimulated bleomycin-induced EMT-like pheno-types in the mouse lung , an effect which was suppressed by coadministration of uridine . This is the first demonstration that administration of a drug known to induce ILD clinically modulates EMT-like phenotypes in vivo . We also found that administration of leflunomide stimulated bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis , and that this was suppressed by co-administration of uridine . Taken together , our findings suggest that leflunomide exacerbates bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis through inhibition of DHODH and the resulting induction of EMT in lung epithelial cells . As described in the �Introduction� section , lung myofibroblasts are produced by both activation of lung fibroblasts and EMT of lung epithelial cells.9 We found that A771726 did not affect the expression of a-SMA and collagen I in HFL1 human lung fibroblast cells data not shown , suggesting that A771726 does not activate fibro-blasts to form myofibroblasts . These results suggest that the EMT-inducing ability of leflunomide is involved in its exacerbation of pulmonary fibrosis . This finding is an important step toward addressing the molecular mechanism of drug-induced ILD , as well as the mechanism governing the racial differences for susceptibility to ILD induced by the drug . It is possible that the susceptible phenotype of Japanese patients is due to a specific polymor-phism in genes related to EMT . Furthermore , the exacer-bation of pulmonary fibrosis by leflunomide can be used as an animal model of drug-induced pulmonary fibrosis , allowing screening to eliminate candidate drugs for the potential side effects .

20489732	www.nature.com cdd Mitochondria are the driving force behind life , as mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation provides the main source of ATP in the cell . In addition to energy production , mitochondria have a crucial function in mediating amino-acid biosynthesis , fatty acid oxidation , intermediate metabolic pathways , free radicals production and Ca2 ? homeostasis.1 Mitochondria affect intracellular Ca2 ? metabolism in two ways i directly by regulating both the amplitude , duration , location and propagation of cytosolic Ca2 ? elevations and the recycling of Ca2 ? towards the endoplasmic reticulum ER and2 ii indirectly by producing ATP , which is used by Ca2 ? -dependent ATPases to pump Ca2 ? out of the cell by the plasma-membrane Ca2 ? ATPase PMCA or into intracellular stores by the sarco-ER Ca2 ? ATPase SERCA . Conversely , Ca2 ? entering to the mitochondrial matrix regulates mitochondrial metabolism through the activation of the Ca2 ? -dependent enzymes of the Krebs cycle.3 Leigh�s syndrome is a rare but severe and fatal encephalo-pathy of early childhood that is most frequently associated with deficiencies in nucleus-encoded subunits of Complex I NDUFS3 and NDUFS7 , 4,5 Complex II SDHA , 6 Complex IV SURF1 7 or pyruvate dehydrogenase.8 Despite the identi-fication of the genetic origin of Leigh�s syndrome , the mole-cular and cellular events associated with pathology are not completely understood . Deregulations of intracellular Ca2 ? signalling have been reported in different models of mitochondrial respiratory chain diseases , 9�11 whereas data on Complex II deficiency are still lacking . Complex II succinate ubiquinone UQ oxidoreductase has a central function in oxidative metabolism , being an important enzyme of the citric acid cycle as well as a Complex of the mitochondrial respiratory chain.12 We report here the cellular events deriving from Complex II mutation associated with Leigh�s syndrome . This study was conducted also in cellular models in which we mimicked Complex II deficiency by using Complex II inhibitors . We showed broad subcellular Ca2 ? signalling alterations occurring before cell demise in Complex II-deficient cells . Interestingly , we showed that cytosolic and mitochondrial Ca2 ? overload are linked to SERCA and PMCA degradation occurring in a proteasome-dependent manner . Our study also revealed a dual function of Ca2 ? deregulation in the control of cellular bioenergetics outcome and mitochondrial pathology . Results We studied fibroblasts isolated from a patient with Leigh�s syndrome harbouring a homozygous Arg554Trp substitution in the Fp subunit of the Complex II SDHAR554W .13 These fibroblasts were shown to present a reduction of Complex II activity to B30 % of control values.13 Leigh�s syndrome associated with Complex II mutations was described in very rare cases.6 To bypass this limitation , we conducted the whole study using two inhibitors of Complex II 3-NP 3-nitropro-pionic acid or Atpenin A514,15 in both fibroblasts derived from healthy individuals and the neuronal-derived cell line SH-SY5Y . 3-NP is structurally similar to Complex II substrate succinate thus interacting with some residue in the active site of the enzyme.14 Atpenins were shown to share structural similarity with UQ thus blocking the electron transfer between the enzyme and UQ by binding to a region that partly overlaps with the physiological UQ-binding site.15 To note , we deliberately used i concentrations of 3-NP 300 mM and Atpenin A5 100 nM , which did not induce cell death at 20 h thus affording to study Complex II deficiency independently from cell death Supplementary Figure S1a and ii extended application 20 h of the drugs to chronically inhibit Complex II Supplementary Figure S1b . Importantly , under these conditions , Complex II activity was reduced to 15�40 % of control values in both mutated cells and control fibroblasts and SH-SY5Y cells Supplementary Figure S1b and Table S1 . Application of 3-NP or Atpenin A5 at the same concentrations for 72 h or application of 1 mM 3-NP for 20 h determined cell death showing that Complex II inhibition is linked to cell death Supplementary Figure S1c and 1d right . To show that in our conditions we mimicked chronic Complex II inhibition on drug application , we measured Complex II activity at 6 and 20 h after treatment with 300 mM 3-NP . Interestingly , reduction of Complex II activity occurred on 6 h of treatment and was maintained to a similar level on 20 h of treatment data not shown . We assessed mitochondrial functionality on Complex II mutation or inhibition . Mitochondrial potential Dcmit was measured by using tetramethyl rhodamine methyl ester TMRM dye , which accumulates within the mitochondrial matrix as a function of Dcmit . As expected , we observed a significant decrease B70 % versus control considered as 100 % of Dcmit on Complex II mutation or inhibition in both fibroblasts and SH-SY5Y cells Figures 1a and b , respec-tively Supplementary Table S2 . The mitochondrial respiratory chain is known to be the major source of reactive oxygen species ROS within the cell.16 We measured mitochondrial production of superoxide O2 K by using MitoSOX red-mitochondrial superoxide indicator . Complex II-deficient cells displayed an increase in mitochondrial O2 K production of almost 25 % as compared with control Figure 1c Supplementary Table S3 . The speci-ficity of the test was confirmed by using the ROS scavenger pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate PDCT Figure 1c Supplemen-tary Table S3 . This result is consistent with earlier reported data , which show increased activities of both mitochondrial and cytosolic inducible superoxide dismutase in SDHAR554W cells.17 Next , we analysed the impact of the mitochondrial Complex II defect on ATP level . Basal-mitochondrial ATP concentration [ ATP ] mit was measured using a luciferase probe targeted to the mitochondria mitLuc . We observed a decreased basal [ ATP ] mit in SDHAR554W-mutated fibroblasts 74 % of that in control cells as well as in SH-SY5Y cells on Complex II inhibition 83 % in 3-NP and 77 % in Atpenin A5 of that in control cells Figures 1d and e Supplementary Table S4 . Ca2 ? is an important regulator of mitochondrial function and acts at several levels within the organelle to stimulate OXPHOS.3 We measured subcellular Ca2 ? signalling in fibroblasts and SH-SY5Y cells on Complex II mutation or inhibition . Measurement of basal [ Ca2 ? ] cyt , by using the Fluo-4 , AM dye , revealed a significant increase B2�4-fold of basal [ Ca2 ? ] cyt in SDHAR554W-mutated fibroblasts and in control fibroblasts on Complex II inhibition as compared with non-treated ones Figure 2a Supplementary Table S5 . Similarly , we also observed an increase of basal [ Ca2 ? ] mit in SDHAR554W-mutated fibroblasts and in control fibroblasts on Complex II inhibition B1.5�2-fold as compared with non-treated cells as measured by X-Rhod-1 , AM probe Figure 2b Supplementary Table S6 . We then analysed agonist-evoked cytosolic and mitochon-drial Ca2 ? signals using adenovirus-delivered recombinant aequorin Ca2 ? probes cytAEQ , mitAEQ , respectively . By using the cytosolic aequorin probe , we showed a significant increase B1.5�1.7-fold of the agonist-evoked cytosolic Ca2 ? signal [ Ca2 ? ] cyt in SDHAR554W-mutated fibroblasts and SH-SY5Y cells on Complex II inhibition as compared with controls Figure 2c Supplementary Table S7 . By using the mitochondrial aequorin probe , we noticed a significant increase of agonist-evoked mitochondrial Ca2 ? signal [ Ca2 ? ] mit in SDHAR554W-mutated fibroblasts B3-fold increase and SH-SY5Y cells on Complex II inhibition B1.5-fold increase as compared with controls Figure 2d Supplementary Table S8 . Mitochondrial Ca2 ? uptake and Dcmit are tightly cross-regulated.1 On the one hand , the main driving force for Ca2 ? accumulation across the inner mitochondrial membrane is the electrochemical gradient DmH established and maintained by the respiratory chain , whereas , on the other hand , depolari-zation occurs transiently after Ca2 ? uptake in physiological conditions.1 We measured the kinetics of the Ca2 ? and potential changes occurring in mitochondria of Complex II-deficient cells . Interestingly , we observed an increased agonist-evoked mitochondrial Ca2 ? response as early as after 4 h of treatment with Complex II inhibitors Figure 3a Supplementary Table S8 . This result was observed with both inhibitors 3-NP and Atpenin A5 and in both fibroblasts and SH-SY5Y cells Figure 3a Supplementary Table S8 . In parallel , no modification of Dcmit was noticed in cells treated in the same conditions Figure 3b Supplementary Table S2 . This result suggests that increase of mitochondrial Ca2 ? uptake precedes the loss of Dcmit in Complex II-deficient cells . We then investigated the mechanisms underlying increased [ Ca2 ? ] associated with Complex II deficiency . As cytosolic and mitochondrial Ca2 ? signals are largely dependent of ER Ca2 ? store , we measured the state of 1000 Superoxide MitoSOX 500 n 31 [ Ca 400 Basal 200 c Fibroblasts SH-SY5Y 2 M cyt [ Ca 0 d Fibroblasts SH-SY5Y 100 80 M mit 60 [ Ca 20 0 ER Ca2 ? load by using the ER-targeted aequorin probe . SDHAR554W mutation determined a decrease of steady state ER-free Ca2 ? [ Ca2 ? ] ER by almost B40 % as compared with three different controls Figure 4a Supplementary Table S9 . A slighter but significant decrease B5 % of ER steady state was also obtained on Complex II inhibition by 3-NP and Atpenin A5 Supplementary Figure S2a and Table S9 . We then showed that ER Ca2 ? depletion is associated with decreased ER Ca2 ? uptake rate , and increased passive ER Ca2 ? leakage Figures 4b and c , respectively . No modification of agonist-evoked Ca2 ? release from the store was noticed between control and Complex II-deficient cells Supplementary Figure S2b . Earlier data have shown that ER Ca2 ? depletion can be linked to the induction of the unfolded protein response UPR .18 However , our data revealed no induction of UPR in SDHAR554W cells Supplementary Figure S3 . Finally , no clear modification of capacitative Ca2 ? entry was noted in SDHAR554W-mutated cells as compared with controls Figure 4d ruling out a change in Ca2 ? influx in the observed [ Ca2 ? ] cyt and [ Ca2 ? ] mit increase . These results may indicate that the increased cytosolic and mitochondrial agonist-evoked Ca2 ? signals are largely linked to increased basal Ca2 ? levels . This late event is likely due , at least in part , to decreased ER Ca2 ? store load and increased ER Ca2 ? emptying through increased Ca2 ? leak . To investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying the intracellular Ca2 ? overload related to Complex II deficiency , we analysed SERCA and PMCA expression in Complex II-deficient cells by western blotting . SH-SY5Y cells are known to express mostly SERCA2b and PMCA2 isoforms . As shown in Figure 5a , a significant decrease of SERCA2b and PMCA2 expression was observed in SDHAR554W cells and in SH-SY5Y cells on Complex II inhibition Figure 5a . Interest-ingly , a similar result was observed on inhibition of mito-chondrial ATP synthase by Oligomycin Figure 5a . SERCA and PMCA down-regulation could be due to reduced transcription level or increased rate of degradation . By using semi-quantitative RT-polymerase chain reaction PCR , we showed that SERCA2b and PMCA2 transcription level is not altered on Complex II or ATP synthase inhibition Figure 5b . We then investigated SERCA2b and PMCA2 degradation . SH-SY5Y cells were treated with the protein synthesis inhibitor cyclohexemide CHX in the presence or not of 3-NP or Oligomycin . Kinetic analyses revealed a rapid degradation of both SERCA2b and PMCA2 on Complex II or ATP synthase Figure 5c inhibition . To determine whether SERCA2b and PMCA are degraded by the proteasome , we treated the cells with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 for 2 h and then applied CHX alone or in the presence of 3-NP and Oligomycin for 1 h . As shown in Figure 5d , treatment of the cells with MG132 prevented SERCA2b and 120 100 0 PMCA2 degradation on Complex II or ATP synthase inhibition Figure 5d . These data reveal the involvement of the proteasome-dependent degradation pathway in SERCA2b and PMCA2 down-regulation . The result obtained on ATP synthase blockade by Oligomycin may reveal that rapid degradation of SERCA2b and PMCA2 is an ATP-dependent mechanism . Overall , these data suggests that cytosolic and mitochondrial Ca2 ? overload on Complex II deficiency are a consequence of suppressed cytosolic Ca2 ? extrusion through the plasma membrane and accumulation in the ER by PMCA and SERCA , respectively . As mitochondrial Ca2 ? overload is a major actor triggering mitochondrial structure alteration and swelling , we analysed the mitochondrial structure in the context of Complex II defect . High-resolution imaging revealed no clear mitochondrial structure modification in Complex II-deficient cells as com-pared with controls Supplementary Figure S4a . Accordingly , mitochondrial volume was also not modified on Complex II mutation or inhibition in both fibroblasts and SH-SY5Y cells Supplementary Figure S4b . These data are in accordance with the absence of apoptosis in both models and showed also that increased mitochondrial Ca2 ? content is not associated with increased mitochondrial biogenesis as estimated by unchanged volume . It has been shown that elevated Ca2 ? signals in micro-domains between mitochondria and ER Ca2 ? release sites immobilize mitochondria close to the ER , thus increasing Ca2 ? transfer between the organelles.19 As we showed that Complex II mutation induced on the one hand an increased ER Ca2 ? leak and on the other hand an elevation of mitochondrial Ca2 ? load Figures 2b , d and 4 , we tested whether these modifications are associated with mitochon-drial movement inhibition and ER-mitochondria increased contact sites . High-resolution time-lapse imaging of the mitochondrial network revealed a significant reduction of mitochondrial movements on Complex II mutation or inhibition in both fibroblasts and SH-SY5Y cells Figure 6a Supple-mentary Table S10 . Accordingly , high-resolution imaging revealed an increase of the extent of association between ER and mitochondria on Complex II deficiency Figure 6b Supplementary Table S11 . We then investigated the impact of Ca2 ? deregulation on cellular bioenergetics and mitochondrial dysfunction related to Complex II deficiency . Measurement of total ATP level on total cell homogenates revealed increased total [ ATP ] in SDHAR554W fibroblasts and in control fibroblasts treated with Atpenin A5 B ? 15 % versus control Figure 7a Supplementary Table S12 . Similar results were obtained in SH-SY5Y cells on Complex II inhibition Figure 7b Supplementary Table S12 . Besides the mitochondrial respiratory chain , glycolysis constitutes a second source of cellular ATP . As we showed a decrease of [ ATP ] mit Figures 1d and e , the increased total [ ATP ] is expected to be due to glycolysis activation . Indeed , glyco-lysis inhibition with 2-deoxy-D-glucose a non-metabolizable analogue of glucose leads to a decrease of total [ ATP ] 300 250 M 200 ? ER ] 150 2+ [ Ca 100 S M 8 ? Ca 2 ER 60 It has been recently shown that intracellular Ca2 ? may activate glycolytic ATP synthesis.21 Accordingly , we showed that Ca2 ? chelation by BAPTA , AM reduced total [ ATP ] in control and Complex II-deficient cells Figure 7c Supplemen-tary Table S13 . Interestingly , the extent of ATP reduction was larger in Complex II-deficient cells as compared with controls 72 % in control , 60 % in SDHAR554W and 65 % in Atpenin A5 Figure 7c Supplementary Table S13 . The data presented in Figure 1 showed an overt mito-chondrial pathology on Complex II deficiency . Different 0.11 0.10 0.10 A.U . 0.62 0.14 0.03 A.U . 2 0 1 R554W SDHA laboratories have reported the complex cross-interactions between Dcmit , Ca2 ? and ROS production.1 It was also shown that mitochondrial depolarization requires and is maintained by the high [ Ca2 ? ] cyt.22 We thus investigated the role of cytosolic Ca2 ? overload on Dcmit loss linked to Complex II deficiency . As shown in Figure 7d , application of BAPTA , AM rescued mitochondrial potential in SDHAR554W cells Figure 7d Supplementary Table S14 . We assume that mitochondrial potential recovery observed in SDHAR554W is due to reduced mitochondrial Ca2 ? uptake as a consequence of removal of [ Ca2 ? ] cyt by BAPTA , AM . Indeed , BAPTA , AM application reduced mitochondrial basal and agonist-evoked [ Ca2 ? ] data not shown . In accordance with this result , cell treatment with BAPTA , AM also revealed a significant reduction of [ O2 K ] in SDHAR554W cells Figure 7e Supple-mentary Table S15 . These findings suggest that Ca2 ? overload participated to mitochondrial pathology observed in Complex II-deficient cells . We finally addressed the question about the consequences of mitochondrial pathology linked to Complex II deficiency on 1.2 Control n 47 0 Fibroblasts SH-SY5Y n 29 cellular fate . In accordance with earlier reported data , 23,24 we showed that complete Complex II inhibition 1 mM 3-NP treatment for 20 h Supplementary Figure S1d , right panel determined cell death Supplementary Figure S1d , left panel , mitochondrial structure alteration Supplementary Figure S5a and reduction of mitochondrial Ca2 ? load Supplemen-tary Figure S5b . These processes are known as markers of mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization and swelling accompanying cell death . Discussion By studying fibroblasts isolated from a patient affected by Leigh�s syndrome harbouring respiratory chain Complex II SDHAR554W mutation13 and fibroblasts and neuronal-derived cells chronically treated with Complex II inhibitors , we reported subcellular Ca2 ? deregulations occurring before cell death and showed that Complex II deficiency induced a deep regulation of Ca2 ? signalling-dependent bioenergetics and mitochondrial dysfunction , which control cellular fate . vs Total % 40 d Fibroblasts e Fibroblasts Only few studies have been focusing on the study of Complex II inhibition and none has provided a global assess-ment of subcellular Ca2 ? signalling before cell death . These studies reported that inhibition of Complex II by 3-NP enhances basal and NMDA-induced intracellular [ Ca2 ? ] in neurons , 23,25,26 potentially leading to Dcmit loss , mitochondrial structure alteration , ROS production and cell death.23,26,27 The parallel and thorough investigation of subcellular Ca2 ? and bioenergetics alterations on Complex II mutation or chronic inhibition allowed us to reveal the following pattern Figure 8 Complex II deficiency is associated with the proteasome-dependent degradation of the two important Ca2 ? ATPases , SERCA and PMCA thus leading to increase cytosolic Ca2 ? signals . Increased [ Ca2 ? ] cyt and ER Ca2 ? leak likely caused increased [ Ca2 ? ] mit through increased ER-mitochondria contact sites and mitochondrial immobili-zation . As 99.9 % of the total matrix Ca2 ? content is in bound form , 28 we can not exclude a function for an increased mitochondrial retention capacity in the observed mitochon-drial Ca2 ? overload e.g . Ca2 ? binding to cardiolipin , anionic phospholipids , the carboxy-anion-containing metabolites of the Krebs cycle citrate , oxaloacetate and inorganic phosphate 28 . The situation in Complex II-deficient cells is particular as a large number of studies have reported reduced Ca2 ? signals in different models of mitochondrial respiratory chain diseases i.e. in MELAS mitochondrial encephalopathy , lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes , 10 and MERRF myoclonic epilepsy and ragged-red fibres , 9 and in Complex I-mutated fibroblasts11 . To note , our study was conducted in models before cell death thus revealing primary Ca2 ? deregulation events occurring on Complex II deficiency . We showed that cytosolic and mitochondrial Ca2 ? overload linked to Complex II deficiency are likely to be due to rapid degradation of SERCA2b and PMCA2 occurring in a protea-some-dependent manner . This phenomenon is predictably related to the decreased mitochondrial ATP production , as SERCA2b and PMCA2 degradation was also observed on ATP synthase inhibition . Complex II-dependent SERCA2b and PMCA2 degradation occurs despite the slight increase of glycolysis-dependent , cytosolic [ ATP ] pointing out a primary function of mitochondrial ATP in the degradation process . Indeed , mitochondrial ATP is considered the major cellular Figure 8 Schematic model representing subcellular Ca2 ? deregulation , mitochondrial dysfunction and bioenergetics outcomes on Complex II mutation or inhibition . Complex II deficiency induces mitochondrial function alteration reduced Dcmit and [ ATP ] mit and increased [ O2 ] , and subcellular Ca2 ? deregulation . The increased [ Ca2 ? ] cyt is mediated by i increased ER Ca2 ? leak and ii degradation of PMCA and SERCA2b . Mitochondrial Ca2 ? overload is facilitated by mitochondrial movement inhibition and increased ER-mitochondria contact sites . This leads on the one hand to mitochondrial Ca2 ? overload and on the other hand to glycolysis-dependent ATP production . RCC respiratory chain complexes . CLC Ca2 ? leak channels . U uniporter ATP source . Alternatively , and not exclusively , the proximity between mitochondria and plasma and or ER membranes could explain the sensitivity of SERCA2b and PMCA2 to mitochondrial ATP production . Accordingly , the existence of ATP micro-domains beneath the plasma membrane and in ER-mitochondria contact sites has been already shown in some cell models.29,30 Proteasome-dependent degradation of SERCA2a isoform was reported in an earlier work by Ihara et al.31 Ubiquitination of PMCA1 isoform has also been detected after precondition-ing ischaemia in rat cortical neuronal cultures.32 As poly-ubiquitylated proteins are the preferred proteasome 26S substrates , we postulate that SERCA2b and PMCA2 undergo proteasome-dependent degradation after their ubiquitination . It is known that ATP Mg2 ? regulates the 26S proteasome activity , its assembly and stability.33 However , Geng et al.34 showed that a subset of 26S proteasome is activated as ATP levels decline . Thus , in the context of Complex II deficiency , mitochondrial ATP depletion may have favoured the activation of a subset of 26S proteasome leading to SERCA2b and PMCA2 degradation . Increased total ATP production has been recently reported in MELAS syndrome linked to Complex I ND5 gene mutation.35 In this study , glycolytic ATP has been shown to be consumed by mitochondria to maintain Dcmit . In addition , Ca2 ? -dependent activation of anaerobic glycolysis and increased cytosolic ATP have been recently described during apoptotic cell death.21 As our study was conducted before cell death , increased glycolysis-dependent [ ATP ] may be a compensatory mechanism to the decreased oxidative phosphorylation-dependent ATP production . This pheno-menon is Ca2 ? dependent as we showed that Ca2 ? chelation by BAPTA , AM reversed glycolytic-dependent ATP production . Thus , the increase of intracellular Ca2 ? signals may be considered as a first attempt to delay cellular pathology through the activation of glycolytic-dependent ATP production . Our study revealed a double hint of Ca2 ? signalling deregu-lation in Complex II-deficient cells as besides increasing glycolytic ATP production , Ca2 ? overload favoured mitochon-drial pathology . Thus , depending on their energetic needs , cells with Complex II defect may thus undergo a progressive mitochondrial dysfunction , characterized by Dcmit loss , Ca2 ? overload and increased ROS , eventually leading to cell death Supplementary Figure S5 . As a matter of fact , neuronal loss was reported in the brain of the patient harbouring SDHAR554W mutation.36 Materials and Methods Chemicals . Culture material was obtained from Invitrogen SARL , Cergy Pontoise , France , coelenterazine , and fluorescent dyes from Molecular Probes Invitrogen , SARL , and Atpenin A5 from Coger eMarketLabo.com . All the other reagents and chemicals were from Sigma-Aldrich Sigma-Aldrich , SARL , Lyon , France . Cell culture . Fibroblasts were grown as already described.17 Human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells CRL-2266 ATCC , Manassas , VA , USA were cultured following manufacturer�s instructions . Aequorin measurements . To bypass low transfection efficiency of fibroblasts and SH-SY5Y cells , we used the earlier described adenoviral system expressing cytosolic AdCMVcytAEQ - , mitochondrial AdCMVmitAEQmut and AdCMVmitAEQwt - , and ER AdCMVerAEQ -targeted aequorin probes.37�39 For infection , B20000 cells fibroblasts and 150000 cells SH-SY5Y were spotted on 13-mm coverslips , and placed 24 h later in contact with the appropriate virus 105 infectious particles ml . Aequorin measurements were performed 48 h post-infection . Specific targeting of adenoviral aequorin probes to desired organelles was verified by immunohistochemistry Supplementary Figure S6 .

For reconstitution with high efficiency of the erAEQ , the luminal [ Ca2 ? ] of this compartment was first reduced . This was achieved by incubating the cells for 1 h at 41C in KRB supplemented with 5 mM n-coelenterazine , 1 mM Ca2 ? ionophore ionomycin and 600 mM EGTA . After this incubation , cells were extensively washed with KRB supplemented with 2 % bovine serum albumin before the luminescence measurement was initiated . The ER was refilled by exposing the cells to extra-cellular 1 mM CaCl2 . After reaching the steady state value , agonist-evoked Ca2 ? release was initiated by application of agonists . The SERCA blocker , TBuBHQ 2 , 5 -Di tert-butyl -1 , 4-benzohydroquinone was used to initiate the release of stored Ca2 ? and thus to analyse ER Ca2 ? leak . All aequorin measurements were carried out in a purpose built luminometer . The experiments were terminated by lysis of the cells with 100 mM digitonin in a hypotonic Ca2 ? -rich solution 10 mM CaCl2 in H2O , thus discharging the remaining aequorin pool . The light signal was collected and calibrated into [ Ca2 ? ] values , as earlier described.18 On the basis of the experimental traces , the maximum rates of ER Ca2 ? uptake were measured from the first derivative of the ascending refilling phase obtained after CaCl2 addition , and the maximum rates of ER Ca2 ? leak were measured from the first derivative of the curve on addition of TBuBHQ using Origin 5 software . Fitting of the curve was performed using Microsoft Excel software . ATP measurements . Mitochondrial [ ATP ] was measured after transient transfection of mitochondrial-targeted luciferase probe mit-LUC . Briefly , cell luminescence was measured in the same luminometer used for aequorin measurements . Cells were perfused with KRB , supplemented with 1 mM CaCl2 and then shifted to the same buffer supplemented with 20 mM luciferin . At the end of each experiment , digitonin-permeabilized cells were perfused with an intracellular buffer IB 140 mM KCl , 5 mM NaCl , 1 mM K3HPO4 , 2 mM MgSO4 , 20 mM Hepes , pH 7.05 at 371C supplemented with 100 mM EGTA , 20 mM luciferin and 5 mM of ATP MgCl2 . Mitochondrial basal ATP level was normalized to the maximum luciferase signal obtained after cell permeabilization with digitonin and considered as 100 % . For total ATP level , we used ATP Bioluminescence Assay kit CL II Roche , Diagnostics , Meylan , France . Measurements of cytosolic and mitochondrial basal [ Ca2 ? ] concentrations . Cells spotted on 24-mm coverslips were loaded with 5 mM Fluo-4 , AM cytosolic Ca2 ? probe or 1 mM X-Rhod-1 , AM mitochondrial Ca2 ? probe prepared in a KRB 1 mM CaCl2 at 371C for 30 min . After a brief washout , time-lapse images were acquired on a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope Carl Zeiss , S.A.S. LePecq , France . We calibrated Fluo-4 , AM and X-Rhod-1 , AM probes as recently described by our group18 and provided absolute basal Ca2 ? values in the cytosol and the mitochondria . After a control period providing the basal fluorescent intensity , F , Fmax was obtained on application of ionomycin Ca2 ? solution ionomycin 10 mM and Ca2 ? 50 mM . Then , the Fmin value was obtained on addition of 10 mM EGTA solution in the same bath . We used the equation provided by the manufacturer [ Ca2 ? ] free ? Kd* F-Fmin Fmax-F and the Kd value of 700 nM for X-Rhod-1 , AM and of 345 nM for Fluo-4 , AM . Measurements of mitochondrial superoxide concentration . MitoSOX red is a novel fluorogenic dye for highly selective detection of superoxide in the mitochondria of living cells . Cells spotted on 24-mm coverslips were loaded with 5 mM MitoSOX red prepared in a KRB 1 mM CaCl2 at 371C for 30 min . After a brief washout , Z-stack images were acquired on a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope Carl Zeiss . Dye intensity was quantified on maximal projection of Z-stack images after thresholding , using the Zeiss LSM and ImageJ softwares . We presented data as mean fluorescence intensity of oxidized MitoSOX . We assume that MitoSOX probe give a semi-quantitative detection and not an absolute estimation of mitochondrial superoxide value . Importantly , as control , we used the ROS scavenger PDCT to show the specificity of this probe . Imaging analyses . For the measurement of mitochondrial movements or mitochondrial potential Dcmit , images were acquired on a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope after loading the cells with 10 nM Mitotracker red movement analysis or 20 nM TMRM Dcm analysis in KRB 1 mM CaCl2 at 37 1C for 30 min . For mitochondria movement analysis , time series images were taken with a time interval of 5 s between each image . Images were 2D-deconvolved , median filtered , thresholded and clipped to 8-bit binary images using Metamorph Universal Imaging software . Using the stack-T-functions Delta-F-down plugin of the WCIF ImageJ software http www.uhnres.utoronto.ca facilities wcif , pixels in each frame were subtracted from the next frame . The resulting images were quantified by measuring the total area of object on the binary and DF images by the integrated morphometry analysis function of the Metamorph software . Data were normalized as the ratio of DF area values over the total area of the original binary images for each cell . This parameter is referred to as the mitochondrial movement index.18 Binarization and normalization were applied to avoid artefacts eventually arising from changes of intensity and focal plane . To obtain normalized TMRM fluorescence signal , time-lapse images were acquired on a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope . Images were acquired before and after application of 10 mM mitochondrial uncoupler FCCP . To show specific TMRM binding , measurements were routinely corrected for residual TMRM fluorescence after full Dcmit collapse with FCCP . Basal TMRM signal was normalized to the remaining signal obtained on FCCP application and presented as f f0 where f is the mean of basal TMRM intensity along 10 s in the plateau phase and f0 is the mean of TMRM intensity along the baseline after FCCP application . For analyses of ER-mitochondria contact sites , cells were transfected with erGFP and loaded with Mitotracker Deep Red . The spectral properties of these two fluorochromes allow specific identification of the two compartments and quantification of contact sites . 16-bit images were acquired with a pixel size equal or lower to the maximal resolution of the 63X objective to allow optimal detection of colocalized pixels on the stage of a Leica SP5 confocal microscope . ER and mitochondria colocalization was calculated as the number of voxels volume pixels occupied by both signals i.e. erGFP and Mitotracker Deep Red over all voxels occupied by the mitochondria Mitotracker Deep Red signal in thresholded images using Imaris software . Protein preparation and western-blot analyses . Plasma membrane and microsomal fractions were isolated as already described.18,40 SDS-PAGE was then performed . The signal was revealed using ECL Plus western-blot detection reagent Amersham Biosciences , Orsay , France . For the experiments shown in Figures 5c and d , membrane fraction obtained as already described18 was used to reveal both SERCA and PMCA . Protein synthesis was inhibited using 100 mM CHX alone or in the presence of 300 mM 3-NP or 5 mM Oligomycin for the indicated time points . Proteasome-dependent degradation of SERCA2b and PMCA2 was assessed using proteasome inhibitor MG132 . After 2 h pre-incubation of SH-SY5Y cells with or without MG132 5 mM , cells were treated for 1 h with 100 mM CHX in the presence or not of 300 mM 3-NP or 5 mM Oligomycin . Loading control was assessed using a-tubulin , GRP94 as a marker of a resident ER protein and cadherin as a marker of a resident plasma-membrane protein . Similar result was obtained using these loading controls . Only the result of a-tubulin is shown . RNA extraction and RT-PCR analysis .

20489733	Inhibition of Drp1-dependent fragmentation and apoptosis antagonist of calcineurin GM Cereghetti1 , V Costa1 and L Scorrano* , 1,2 Mitochondria are important organelles in the regulation of apoptosis . They amplify the intrinsic pathway by releasing protein cofactors that are essential for the activation of effector caspases such as cytochrome c and for the direct condensation of chromatin such as AIF .1 This release is the consequence of permeabilization of the outer membrane of the organelle and it is controlled by members of the Bcl-2 family . In a widely accepted model , the subset of �BH3-only� Bcl-2-family members senses the �private� death stimuli , transferring it to mitochondria whose outer membrane is permeabilized through the �multidomain� proapoptotic members . The action of BH3-only proteins is counteracted by antiapoptotic members that prevent activation of the multidomains in the mitochondrial membrane by soaking the BH3-only members.2,3 Thus , in this model , the only mitochon-drial event that has an important function in the progression of the apoptotic cascade is the loss of the controlled permeability of the outer membrane of the organelle . One of the basic tenets of apoptosis , that mitochondrial shape is unchanged , has been recently challenged , thanks to the development of more refined techniques of investigation of mitochondrial shape and ultrastructure . A new consensus developed that mitochondria undergo massive fragmentation around the time of their outer membrane permeabilization , 4,5 and that the complete release of cytochrome c is accompanied by ultrastructural changes collectively called cristae remodeling.6 www.nature.com cdd Mitochondrial shape is determined by the equilibrium between continuously ongoing fusion and fission processes . In mammalian cells , a core machinery of �mitochondria-shaping� proteins exists that impinges on fusion or fission of the organelle . Mitochondrial fusion depends on the outer membrane mitofusins Mfn 1 and 2 and on the inner membrane Optic Atrophy 1 Opa1 .7 These proteins are large dynamin-related GTPases that display pleiotropic functions for example , Opa1 regulates biogenesis and remodeling of the cristae independently of its function in fusion , 8,9 whereas Mfn2 tethers mitochondria to the endoplasmic reticulum.10 Mitochondrial fission depends on the translocation of cyto-plasmic dynamin-related protein 1 Drp1 to mitochondria , in which it binds to its adaptor in the outer membrane , Fis1 , oligomerizes , and constricts the organelle , ultimately leading to its fission.11,12 Dephosphorylation of Drp1 by the cytosolic Ca2 ? -dependent phosphatase calcineurin regulates its subcellular localization and promotes its translocation to mitochondria.13,14 The molecular knowledge of the players in mitochondrial shape regulation stimulated intense research in the last few years on their function in cell death . In particular , a dominant-negative mutant of Drp1 , in which substitution of lysine 38 for an alanine in the GTPase domain disrupted its enzymatic activity , prevents fragmentation of the mitochondrial network , mitochondrial membrane depolarization , cytochrome c release , and cell death induced by staurosporine , placing Drp1 and mitochondrial fragmentation early in apoptosis.4 Further , Drp1 was found to accumulate at mitochondrial fission sites together with Bax and Mfn2.15 Dominant-negative Drp1 was shown not to impede Bax translocation to mitochondria , implying that Bax translocation alone is not sufficient for cell death induction.9,15�17 Interestingly , down-regulation of Drp1 by shRNA showed that even if inhibiting cytochrome c release , absence of Drp1 was not sufficient to prevent release of other proapoptotic factors from mitochon-dria on induction of cell death , suggesting that mitochondrial subcompartimentalization of cytochrome c stores might be altered by Drp1.16,18 Accordingly , remodeling of the cristae can be also blocked by a dominant-negative mutant of Drp1 during apoptosis induced by the BH3-only protein BIK , 19 and in Drp1 cells , cytochrome c release in response to apoptotic stimuli is delayed , whereas release of Smac DIABLO is unaffected.20 Recently , Nunnari and coworkers found that mdivi-1 , a specific chemical inhibitor of Drp1 GTPase activity , prevents both mitochondrial fission and Bax-mediated mito-chondrial outer membrane permeabilization.21 Although there is mounting evidence that mitochondrial fission participates in apoptosis , recent reports questioned whether genetic maneuvers aimed at upregulating mitochondrial fusion are cytoprotective , 22 leaving the question of whether mitochondrial fragmentation is a decision step toward cell death . We recently showed that Drp1 interacts with the cyto-plasmic peptidylprolyl isomerase cyclophilin A CypA in the cytosol . This interaction is lost on induction of mitochondrial fragmentation triggered by depolarization of the organelle and calcineurin activation.14 On dephosphorylation at the Ser 637 residue by calcineurin , Drp1 translocates to mitochondria causing their fission . This calcineurin loop in principle could provide a target to manipulate apoptotic mitochondrial fission . However , two problems should be taken into account when addressing this possibility . First , compounds that inhibit calcineurin , such as cyclosporine A CsA , also act on the permeability transition pore PTP , whose function in at least certain paradigms of cell death is well established . Second , it has been shown that CypA is associated with dynamitin , a component of the dynein-associated dynactin molecular motor complex responsible for retrograde protein transport along the microtubules network , and this association can be blocked by CsA.23 Dynein has also been implied in the translocation of Drp1 to mitochondria , further complicating the picture.24 This raises the question of whether inhibitors of calcineurin affect translocation of Drp1 to mitochondria specifically by blocking dephosphorylation of Drp1 , or whether they act indirectly , by interfering with the interplay between Drp1 and dynein . In an attempt to find an answer to these questions , our attention was caught by a peptide correspond-ing to the peptidylprolyl isomerase domain of immunophilin FK506-binding protein 52 FKBP52 residues ranging from glycine 32 to lysine 138 , which is able to inhibit association between CypA and dynein.23,25 This peptide represents a useful tool to address these questions . Here , we show that expression of the FKBP52 peptide PPD1 prevents Drp1 interaction with CypA and calcineurin , but does not dissociate Drp1 from dynein . PPD1 still inhibits mitochondrial fragmenta-tion by blocking calcineurin activity and preventing recruitment of Drp1 to mitochondria . In cells expressing PPD1 , transloca-tion of Bax and release of Smac DIABLO are unaffected , whereas mitochondrial fragmentation , cytochrome c release , and cell death induced by different apoptotic stimuli are prevented . The action of PPD1 is independent of Bad , another important target of calcineurin during apoptosis , and is not additive to blockage of Drp1 . Thus , PPD1 further supports a function for calcineurin-mediated mitochondrial fragmentation during apoptosis and it unveils a novel potential site of action to intervene in therapy of pathological conditions in which excess apoptosis should be blocked . Results PPD1 inhibits depolarization-induced mitochondrial fragmentation . Mitochondrial depolarization triggers calci-neurin activation , dephosphorylation of Drp1 , and its trans-location to mitochondria , both blocked by the calcineurin inhibitors FK506 and CsA . In fact , Drp1 interacts with calcineurin and with CypA and it is largely associated to microtubules . On mitochondrial dysfunction , Drp1 leaves this complex and the microtubules translocating to mitochondria.14 Interestingly , the microtubule-anchored dynein motor complex regulates Drp1 translocation to mitochondria24 and CypA was shown to act as a mediator of binding of proteins to the dynein motor complex.23 Thus , the inhibitory effect of FK506 and CsA might depend on their ability to displace Drp1 from dynein . To test this possibility , we turned to PPD1 , a peptide corresponding to the peptidylprolyl isomerase domain of immunophilin FK506-binding protein 52 aa . 32�138 that displaces CypA from dynein . We therefore checked whether PPD1 had any effect on mitochondrial depolarization or fragmentation . Expression of PPD1 did not prevent mitochondrial depolarization induced by the lipid arachidonic acid ArA , as shown by real-time imaging of the mitochondrial fluorescence of the potentiometric dye tetramethyl rhodamine methylester TMRM loaded in HeLa cells cotransfected with GFP and PPD1 or an empty vector Figure 1a . Similarly , expression of PPD1 did not affect depolarization by the protonophore carbonylcyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenyl-hydrazone FCCP . ArA and FCCP induce rapid fragmentation of HeLa mitochondria , causing the transition from network to individual organelles in approximately 10 min . Of note , PPD1 greatly delayed depolarization-induced , Drp1-dependent mitochondrial fragmentation , even if it had no effect on mitochondrial depolarization Figure 1b and c . PPD1 displaces CypA from Drp1 , inhibiting calcineurin activation and Drp1 dephosphorylation . PPD1 could , therefore , represent a novel inhibitor of mitochondrial fragmentation acting by displacing Drp1 from dynein . To test this hypothesis , we immunoprecipitated Drp1 in HeLa cells and verified how PPD1 and mitochondrial dysfunction modulated its association with dynein . Western blot analysis of the co-immunoprecipitated material showed that interaction of Drp1 with CypA was diminished by expression of PPD1 Figure 2a . On the contrary , interaction of Drp1 with dynein was not influenced by the presence of the peptide , indicating that interaction of Drp1 with the dynein motor complex is not mediated by the immunophilin Figure 2 . Although association of Drp1 with CypA was completely lost on induction of mitochondrial fragmentation by ArA , interaction of the protein with dynein persisted . Thus , modulation of binding to dynein could not account for the inhibitory effect of PPD1 on mitochondrial fragmentation . Interestingly , the interaction between calcineurin and Drp1 was disrupted in the presence of PPD1 Figure 2a , prompting us to test whether the activity of the phosphatase was also affected by PPD1 . A specific assay indicated that after mitochondrial dysfunction by both ArA and FCCP activity of calcineurin increases and that this is completely abrogated in cells expressing PPD1 Figure 2b . Thus , PPD1 has two important effects it acts as a calcineurin inhibitor that is genetically encoded and , therefore , more stable as opposed to the small pharmacological inhibitors that are metabolized such as CsA and FK506 , and it displaces calcineurin from Drp1 . Accordingly , expression of PPD1 increased the phosphorylation of Ser637 of Drp1 and inhibited the dephosphorylation triggered by ArA , as indicated by specific immunoblotting Figure 2c . These results prompted us to investigate whether under steady state conditions , mitochondrial elongation was enhanced in cells expressing PPD1 . Interestingly , expression of PPD1 almost doubled the length of mitochondria Figure 3a and quantification in Figure 3b . In conclusion , our results indicate that PPD1 increases the phosphorylation of Drp1 by dissociating it from calcineurin , whose activity is also inhibited in cells expressing the peptide . As a result , mitochondria in PPD1 expressing cells are more elongated . PPD1 inhibits cell death at the mitochondrial level . We next verified whether PPD1 inhibited the translocation of Drp1 to dysfunctional mitochondria , dictated by the phosphorylation status of the dynamin-like protein . To this end , we monitored mitochondrial association of endogenous Drp1 Figure 3c and of a Drp1-YFP chimera Figure 3d co-expressed in HeLa cells with a mitochondrially targeted dsRED mtRFP . After mitochondrial depolarization induced by ArA or FCCP , endogenous as well as Drp1-YFP readily translocated to mitochondria and this process was inhibited by contransfection with PPD1 Figure 3c and d . Thus , PPD1 blocks association of Drp1 with dysfunctional mitochondria . This suggests that PPD1 could interfere with apoptotic settings in which the fragmentation of mitochondria is essential for the progression of the cascade . To this end , we tested whether expression of PPD1 delayed the kinetic of apoptosis by a panoply of intrinsic inducers acting through different mechanisms . Expression of PPD1 was able to delay death by staurosporine , etoposide , and thapsigargin , three intrinsic stimuli that recruit the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis controlled by Bax and Bak at the mitochondrial level , as well as by the pro-oxidant H2O2 that recruits mitochondria through the so-called �ER gateway� similarly controlled by the two multidomain proapoptotics26 Figure 4 . Thus , PPD1 delays apoptosis by stimuli that recruit mitochondria , irrespective of their initial mechanism of action , provided that they all cause mitochondrial fragmentation.4,9,27 We further verified whether this was associated with an inhibition of mitochondrial morphological changes induced by apoptotic stimulation . We therefore followed in real time the changes in mitochondrial shape in HeLa cells by imaging the fluorescence of expressed mtRFP . On treatment with staurosporine , mitochondria underwent the known cycle of initial elongation followed by fragmentation that becomes apparent 2 h after induction of apoptosis . Co-expression of PPD1 with mtRFP prevented fragmentation induced by staurosporine Figure 5a . However , PPD1 did not interfere with the translocation of Bax to the mitochondria , which occurs around the time of their fragmentation Supplementary Figure S1 .15 We turned to analyze whether PPD1 was also capable of inhibiting release of apoptogenic factors from mitochondria , by evaluating their subcellular distribution using an immunofluorescence approach28 and found that PPD1 also prevented the release of cytochrome c Figure 5b and c , but was not able to retain Smac DIABLO in the intermembrane space Supplementary Figure S2 . We finally set to test whether PPD1 just delayed death , or whether it exerted a real cytoprotective effect . We measured the intrinsic ability of the survived cells to replicate and form colonies , an ultimate sign that cells have completely survived the apoptotic attack . To this end , HeLa cells were cotransfected with GFP and PPD1 or its empty vector , sorted , plated , and treated with staurosporine . After 5 h , cells were collected and re-plated with fresh medium devoid of apoptotic inducer . A count of individual colonies produced by the re-plated cells showed that cells expressing PPD1 were able to survive and generate new colonies despite the treatment with staurosporine Figure 5d and e . Taken together , these data indicate that PPD1 is capable of preventing cell death induced by stimuli that trigger mitochondrial permeabilization . PPD1 inhibits cell death through the Drp1 pathway . Calcineurin affects a plethora of important cellular processes . For example , it dephosphorylates the proapoptotic Bcl-family protein BAD to induce its migration from the cytosol to mitochondria , leading to cell death.29 Thus , we wished to ascertain whether PPD1 protects from cell death specifically by blocking the Drp1 pathway . To this end , we first had to exclude that the effects of PPD1 were due to its ability to block dephosphorylation of BAD . We , therefore , turned to a genetic approach , comparing the ability of PPD1 to block apoptosis by staurosporine in wt and Bad mouse embryonic fibroblasts MEFs . As expected , apoptosis by staurosporine was reduced in Bad MEFs as compared with their wt counterparts Figure 6 . Expression of PPD1 was able to protect from apoptosis induced by staurosporine also in MEFs , irrespective of the presence of BAD . Thus , BAD is dispensable for the antiapoptotic action of PPD1 . We then set out to investigate whether the effect of PPD1 was mediated by Drp1 . To this end , we verified whether the effect of PPD1 was additive to that of blocking Drp1 . Expression of a dominant-negative Drp1 mutant Drp1K38A was capable of delaying death by staurosporine , such as PPD1 . Of note , co-expression of PPD1 with Drp1K38A did not result in an additional protection , indicating that they act through the same pathway Figure 6 . In conclusion , our data indicate that the inhibition granted by PPD1 is not mediated by BAD and depends on the calcineurin�Drp1 axis . In this study , we show that inhibition of the calcineurin�Drp1 axis by the peptide PPD1 , corresponding to the peptidylprolyl isomerase domain of FKBP52 , inhibits apoptosis . This is supported by a number of findings i expression of PPD1 inhibits activation of calcineurin after mitochondrial dysfunc-tion ii PPD1 does not detach Drp1 from dynein , ruling out a possible alternative mechanism of inhibition of fragmentation iii PPD1 blocks mitochondrial fragmentation , release of cytochrome c , and apoptosis by a number of intrinsic cell death stimuli , and promotes survival of cells treated with staurosporine and iv a genetic analysis reveals that inhibition of cell death by PPD1 does not require BAD , another target of calcineurin during apoptosis , and is not additive to inhibition of Drp1 . In cells expressing PPD1 , the interaction between Drp1 and CypA and calcineurin is disrupted , whereas that between Drp1 and dynein , the main component of the microtubules motor complex , is retained . Indeed , this peptide prevents association of immunophilin FKBP52 with dynein 23 the ability of the peptide to also blunt binding of another immunophilin , CypA , to Drp1 suggests that the interaction between the immunophilin and Drp1 involves formation of a ternary complex between Drp1 , CypA , and dynein . In addition , Drp1 association with the dynein motor complex is not disrupted by induction of mitochondrial fragmentation with ArA , supporting a function for the dynein motor complex as the carrier of Drp1 to mitochondria as earlier suggested.24 The important proapoptotic molecule Bim is also associated with the dynein motor complex and this association is lost during induction of apoptosis , 30 suggesting scenarios of interplay between the apoptotic and the mitochondria-shaping machineries . Our data indicate that PPD1 inhibits calcineurin . As Drp1 interacts with both CypA and calcineurin , 14 we could figure out that the ability of the peptide to inhibit calcineurin is reinforced by the fact that the proteins meet on microtubules and calcineurin is sequestered and inactivated by the CypA�PPD1 complex . PPD1 is an efficient inhibitor of mitochondrial fragmentation induced by mitochondrial depolarization . It also blocks fragmentation induced by apoptotic stimuli , such as stauro-sporine . Even if the function of mitochondrial fragmentation in cell death remains controversial , this finding prompted us to extend our analysis to investigate whether PPD1 displayed any antiapoptotic potential . Interestingly , PPD1 prevents release of cytochrome c induced by staurosporine and delays apoptosis by a number of intrinsic stimuli that trigger death by different mechanisms staurosporine , etoposide , H2O2 , and thapsigargin . Our earlier analysis revealed that killing by these stimuli is complete only when levels of Ca2 ? are adequate.26 This was for us a further suggestion that a Ca2 ? -controlled pathway , such as the calcineurin one , participates in killing by these stimuli . However , whether PPD1 simply slowed down the kinetics of death , or really prevented activation of the post-mitochondrial cascade was unclear . Notably , PPD1 allows clonogenic survival of cells treated with staurosporine , an indication that cells can still proliferate and that caspases are not activated in a majority of cells expressing PPD1 . Such a powerful effect could be supported by the pleiotropic nature of a calcineurin inhibitor like PPD1 . Conversely , our genetic analysis revealed that the mode of action of PPD1 is rather specific . Reed and coworkers showed that Ca2 ? -mobilizing death stimuli induce activation of calcineurin . This in turn dephosphorylates the proapoptotic BH3-only molecule BAD , promotes its recruitment on mito-chondria , triggering permeabilization of the outer membrane and cell death.29 On the other hand , PPD1 is equally antiapoptotic despite the lack of BAD . As expected , deletion of Bad had an inhibitory effect on killing by staurosporine , but expression of PPD1 in Bad cells protected them as well as it did in their wild-type counterparts . Thus , PPD1 does not inhibit death through an effect on calcineurin-mediated dephos-phorylation of BAD . In cells expressing a dominant-negative Drp1 , however , PPD1 has no further inhibitory effect , substan-tiating that it impinges on Drp1 to block apoptosis . Our results further support the view that Drp1 and mitochondrial fragmentation participate in apoptosis . Indeed , earlier works showed that Drp1 GTPase activity participated in cell death , as both a Drp1 mutant defective in GTPase activity because of the substitution of a lysine in the catalytic site for an alanine , K38ADrp1,4 as well as a chemical inhibitor of the hydrolytic activity of the protein , mdivi-1,21 were successful in delaying cell death . The precise mechanism by which inhibition of Drp1 affects progression of cell death remains to be elucidated . Expression of PPD1 does not affect Bax translocation , or Smac DIABLO release , whereas it blunts that of cytochrome c . This is in accordance with the finding that Smac DIABLO and AIF are released even in the absence of Drp1 , whereas cytochrome c is retained in the organelle.18,20,31 As a matter of fact , cytochrome c is highly compartmentalized inside mitochondria , given its preferential localization inside the cristae.6,32 This raises the possibility that the effects of blocking Drp1 in apoptosis are not a consequence of preservation of mitochondrial morphology , but of ultrastructure . This is confirmed by the finding that remodeling of the cristae , which mobilizes cytochrome c , is triggered by Drp1 and blocked by a dominant-negative mutant of this dynamin-related protein.19 This scenario might be even more complicated as ablation of Drp1 causes compensatory changes in the cleavage of the inner membrane Opa133 that controls cristae remodeling during apoptosis.9 In this respect , PPD1 and blockage of calcineurin , that is the Drp1 branch of apoptosis , could be an appealing mechanism to investigate , and in perspective to be pharmacologically attacked it does not interfere with levels , but with mitochondrial translocation of Drp1 . Increasing evidence indicates that mitochondrial fragmen-tation is a hallmark of several diseases associated with increased apoptosis , from Alzheimer�s34 to Parkinson�s35 disease . In addition , calcineurin hyperactivity has been reported to occur during cell death by a variety of intrinsic stimuli etoposide , 36 thapsigargin37 , as well as in relevant pathological conditions such as Parkinson�s , Alzheimer�s , and Huntington�s diseases . Thus , the checkpoint controlled by calcineurin could serve as a potential therapeutic target for compounds or small peptides that mimic the action of PPD1 .

20508645	by modulation of Gsk3b Apoptosis , or programmed cell death , is an evolutionarily conserved mechanism of elimination of unwanted cells . This endogenous death machinery is triggered via two principal signaling pathways.1 The extrinsic pathway is activated by the engagement of death receptors on the cell surface . The binding of ligands , such as Fas , tumor necrosis factor TNF , or TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand TRAIL to cognate death receptors DRs induces the formation of the death-induced signaling complex DISC . This DISC complex in turn recruits caspase-8 and promotes the cascade of procaspase activation.2 The intrinsic pathway is triggered by various intracellular and extracellular stresses , signals of which converge mainly to the mitochondria.2,3 The balance between pro-and anti-apoptotic members of apoptosis is crucial for the regulation of survival and cell death . Aberrant resistance to apoptosis may lead to the development of cancer . Cellular FLICE-inhibitory protein c-FLIP is a death effector domain DED -containing family member that inhibits one of the most proximal steps of DR-mediated apoptosis . Two isoforms of c-FLIP are commonly detected in human cells a long form c-FLIPL and a short form c-FLIPS . c-FLIPL , a 55-kDa protein , contains two DEDs and a caspase-like domain , whereas c-FLIPS , a 26-kDa protein consists only of two DEDs.4 Both isoforms are recruited to the DISC , prevent procaspase-8 activation and block DR-mediated apoptosis , although through different mechanisms.5,6 c-FLIPL is over-expressed in a number of different tumors and its over-expression is related to TRAIL resistance.7,8 Beside cell death , c-FLIPL might also regulate other DR-mediated signals that may be important for tumor-promoting functions , such as proliferation , migration , inflammation or metastasis.9�11 The activation of the transcription factor NF-kB , the PKB Akt pathway and mitogen-activated protein kinases MAPKs , such as c-Jun N-terminal kinase JNK , extracellular signal-regulated kinase ERK and p38 , has been demonstrated to be a consequence of DR triggering.9 Akt is a serine�threonine kinase that regulates the expression and the function of a number of proteins involved in the apoptotic process.12 Akt interaction or phosphorylation of different signaling molecules may regulate their function by different mechanisms , including increased protein stability , cellular localization or binding to a different cellular partner . Akt interacts with a number of proteins involved in apoptotic signaling cascades , including BAD , 13 caspase-9,14 the Forkhead transcription factor FOXO315 and Bcl-w.16 The interaction of Akt with one of these proteins prevents apoptosis through several different mechanisms.13 One major Akt substrate is the serine� theronine kinase Gsk3.17 Originally studied for its role in glycogen metabolism and insulin action , Gsk3 , present in the cells in two isoforms , Gsk3a and Gsk3b , has subsequently been shown to have central functions in many cellular processes , including transcription , cell cycle division , cell fate determination and stem cell maintenance , as well as in apoptosis.17,18 Gsk3 is constitutively active in resting cells , and is functionally inactivated after phosphorylation in response to different stimuli . In this study , we set out to find and investigate new possible partners of Akt that may participate in the regulation of the apoptosis pathway . In this study , we provide evidence that Akt directly interacts with c-FLIPL . Furthermore , we demonstrate that c-FLIPL modulates the activation of Gsk3b . We also provide evidence that this interaction is important for the regulation of TRAIL sensitivity , through the regulation of p27 and caspase-3 levels . Results Akt interacts with c-FLIPL . To find new Akt interactors , we performed a yeast two-hybrid screening . We used the full-length human Akt cDNA sequence as bait and a human cDNA heart library as prey . Among the 200 clones obtained , two were identified to code for the anti-apoptotic protein , c-FLIPL . To prove the interaction between Akt and c-FLIPL , we performed immunoprecipitation experiments on endogenous proteins and on protein extracts from cells transfected with Akt and c-FLIPL cDNAs . We were able to confirm the Akt�c-FLIPL interaction in extracts from transfected cells Figure 1a , and in endogenous proteins from different cell lines Figure 1b . To verify whether Akt activity has a role in Akt�c-FLIPL interaction , HeLa cells were transfected with either wild-type Akt cDNA or with two different Akt mutants kinase-dead Akt Akt D and constitutively active Akt Akt D ? . Protein extracts were Extract 45- ? -Actin immunoprecipitated using a monoclonal anti-Flag antibody and subsequently blotted using an anti-HA antibody . As shown in Figure 1a , c-FLIPL interacted at comparable levels with both the activated kinase and the kinase-dead Akt . c-FLIPL is characterized by two death effector domains DEDs , which are important for interaction with members of the apoptosis cascade . We examined whether these DED domains were important for the interaction with Akt . For this purpose , we generated three different mutants cFLIPL I-DED , missing the first DED cFLIPL II-DED , missing the second DED and cFLIP D DED , missing both DEDs . The three mutants were transfected together with HA�Akt cDNA into HeLa cells . Extracts were immunoprecipitated using anti-Flag antibody and blotted with an anti-HA antibody . As shown in Figure 1c , all the c-FLIPL deletion mutants interacted with Akt , indicating that neither DED domain is necessary for the interaction with Akt . We next investigated whether the carboxy terminal of c-FLIPL was the region of interaction with Akt . For this purpose , we generated different carboxy-terminal c-FLIPL mutants named c-FLIPL F1 a.a . 1�253 , c-FLIPL F3 a.a . 1�339 , c-FLIPL F5 a.a . 1�434 , c-FLIPL R0 a.a . 1�149 and c-FLIPL R1 a.a . 1�182 . Each mutant was transfected together with HA�Akt cDNA in HEK-293 cells . Extracts were immunoprecipitated after 48 h with anti-Flag antibody and blotted with anti-HA antibody . Akt interacted with F3 and F5 mutants but not with F1 , R0 or R1 mutants Figure 1d . The interaction of Akt with the short c-FLIP isoform FLIPs was barely detectable Figure 1e . This suggests that the Akt�c-FLIP-interacting region is located between a.a . 253 and a.a . 339 , within the caspase-like domain . Role of c-FLIPL on growth factor-mediated Akt signaling . Beside cell death , c-FLIPL also regulates other DR-mediated signals . Thus , we set out to verify whether Akt� c-FLIPL interaction might modulate Akt activation . For this purpose , we first transfected increasing amounts of c-FLIPL cDNA and assessed the levels of the activated Akt using specific phospho-Akt antibodies . The overexpression of c-FLIPL did not induce significant differences in insulin-induced Akt phosphorylation Figure 2a , even though it modified the phosphorylation of Gsk3b . As shown in Figure 2b , c-FLIP expression induced a reduction in endogenous Gsk3b basal phosphorylation level , in a dose-dependent manner . A similar inhibition of Gsk3b phos-phorylation , both basal and upon insulin stimulation , was observed on co-transfecting the HA�Gsk3b together with c-FLIP Figure 2c . Such inhibition was not observed in the presence of c-FLIPs Figure 2f . This inhibition was not observed in HeLa cells transfected with c-FLIPL mutants that do not interact with Akt , suggesting that Akt�c-FLIP interaction is necessary for this effect Figure 2d and e . Role of c-FLIP modulation of Gsk3b pathway on TRAIL - induced cell death . Although it has been clearly shown that c-FLIPL overexpression may cause resistance to TRAIL , the effects of Gsk3b on cell death are more controversial.19 However , recently it was described that Gsk3b is involved in the resistance to TRAIL-induced apoptosis . Therefore , we investigated whether c-FLIPL-induced apoptosis resistance upon extrinsic pathway activation was at least in part mediated by its effects on Gsk3b activation . For this purpose , HeLa cells were transfected with Flag c-FLIPL cDNAs alone or in the presence of lithium chloride , an inhibitor of Gsk3 activity.20 The cells were subsequently incubated with TRAIL , and cell death was assessed using a cell viability assay or with propidium iodide staining followed by FACS analysis . As shown in Figure 3a and b , c-FLIPL overexpression decreased the sensitivity of HeLa to TRAIL-induced apoptosis . However , treatment with LiCl completely counteracted the protective effect of c-FLIP on cell death Figure 3a and b . To exclude unspecific effects of LiCl on cell death , the role of the Gsk3b pathway in the anti-apoptotic effect of c-FLIP was further evaluated using a specific Gsk3b kinase-inactive cDNA Gsk3b-KI and measuring caspase-8 activation . As shown in Figure 3c and d , c-FLIPL over-expression reduced TRAIL-induced caspase-8 activation , and this effect was counteracted by both LiCl and Gsk3b-KI cDNA . LiCl and Gsk3b-KI or GSk3b WT cDNA did not produce any effects on endogenous c-FLIPL levels Supplementary Figure 1a . Effects of c-FLIPL on p27Kip1 expression . Recently , Gsk3b inhibition has been suggested to regulate the cell cycle through regulation of p27Kip1 levels.21 In addition , we have recently shown that miRNAs regulate p27Kip1 expression and TRAIL sensitivity.22 Therefore , we addressed the question of whether the effect of c-FLIPL on TRAIL resistance was mediated through Gsk3b activity and thus on p27 expression levels . As shown in Figure 4a , we observed that the levels of p27Kip1 were drastically reduced in HEK-293 cells stably overexpressing c-FLIPL . A similar result was observed also in HeLa cells stably HeLa Tween FLIP or transiently over-expressing c-FLIPL Flag FLIP Figure 4b . However , over-expression of c-FLIPL deletion mutants of the Akt interaction site did not induce reduction in p27Kip1 levels Figure 4c . Moreover , this effect was not observed in the presence of c-FLIPs Figure 4f . The downregulation of Gsk3b , by a specific siRNA or inactivation with LiCl , induced an increase in p27Kip1 levels in HeLa Tween FLIPL compared to cells transfected with a scrambled siRNA Figure 4d . Taken together these results indicate that the effect of c-FLIP on p27Kip1 is mediated by Gsk3b activity . We next investigated whether c-FLIPL�Gsk3 regulate p27Kip1 at mRNA levels . To assess this point , HeLa cells were transfected with 5 mg of Flag c-FLIPL cDNA or a control vector for 48 h , and p27Kip1 cDNA levels were evaluated by real-time PCR . Interestingly , we observed a significant reduction of p27Kip1 mRNA levels in HeLa cells transfected with c-FLIPL but not with its mutant Figure 4e , suggesting that the c-FLIPL�Gsk3 pathway regulates p27Kip1 expression levels through a transcriptional mechanism . The effect of p27Kip1 on TRAIL-mediated apoptotic signaling . We recently provided evidence that p27Kip1 is involved in TRAIL resistance in non-small cell lung cancer NSCLC .22 We demonstrated that in TRAIL-resistant CALU-1 cells , miR-222 and miR-221 are overexpressed and target Flag FLIPL -500 ng 1 ? g 2 ? g 15 20 - kDa 45 - 45 - 55-Flag p27Kip1 , inducing its downregulation . However , TRAIL-sensitive H460 cells exhibited reduced levels of miR-222 and miR-221 and increased p27Kip1 expression . We therefore investigated whether p27Kip1 modulated sensitivity to TRAIL-mediated cell death through the regulation of the apoptotic machinery molecules . To this aim , HeLa Tween FLIP cells , which express p27Kip1 at very low levels , were transfected with HA�p27 cDNA , and caspase-3 levels were investigated by western blot analysis . We observed a significant increase in caspase-3 levels Figure 5a . Furthermore , silencing of p27Kip1 using a specific siRNA in H460 cells , which express p27Kip1 at high levels , resulted in reduction in caspase-3 level Figure 5b . To further confirm the role of the FLIP�Gsk3 pathway on TRAIL apoptotic machinery , we evaluated caspase-3 levels in HeLa Tween c-FLIP-overexpressing cells , Gsk3 pathway of which was inhibited either by Gsk3 siRNA or by LiCl treatment . Both inhibitions resulted in an increase in caspase-3 expres-sion levels , whereas no differences were observed in FADD levels Figure 5c . We investigated whether c-FLIPL modulated caspase-3 transcript levels through a transcriptional mechanism by 100 cells 80 TRAIL - 46-Gsk3- ? TRAIL -1hr 3hr -1hr 3hr -1hr 3hr real-time PCR . Interestingly , we observed a significant reduction in caspase-3 mRNA levels in HeLa cells transfected with c-FLIPL compared with controls , whereas this effect was not observed in FLIP R1 mutant Figure 5d . Finally , we also examined the activity of caspase-3 by the colorimetric CaspACE assay in HeLa cells transfected with an empty vector or with c-FLIPL cDNA . The expression of c-FLIPL induced a reduction of caspase-3 activity + CaspaseAssay Discussion In this study , we provide evidence for a new role of c-FLIPL . c-FLIPL has been identified as an inhibitor of apoptosis triggered by the engagement of death receptors , such as Fas or TRAIL.23,24 c-FLIPL has also been implicated in other cellular functions , such as control of gene expression by ERK and NF-kB.9,25 We demonstrate , to the best of our knowledge , for the first time that Akt interacts with c-FLIPL , and that this interac-tion functionally regulates Gsk3b activation and apoptosis . Recently , Giampietri et al.26 described that in c-FLIP transgenic mice , the phosphorylation of Akt and Gsk3b were reduced compared with control animals , even though cas-pase-3 activity was unchanged , highlighting an apoptosis-independent role of c-FLIP on pressure overload-mediated cardiac hypertrophy . The role of c-FLIP in heart development has been previously described in c-FLIP ko mice that , similar to FADD ko mice , developed severe defects of heart development.27,28 These studies identify c-FLIP as a new regulator of heart development and the hypertrophic re-sponse , possibly through Gsk3 signaling . In this study , by genetic and biochemical methodologies , we have demonstrated that Akt is able to interact with c-FLIPL in the region stretching from a.a . 253 to a.a . 339 of the c-FLIPL protein . We observed that overexpression of c-FLIPL , although does not interfere with insulin-induced Akt activation , almost abolishes Gsk3b phosphorylation . The effects on Gsk3b were abrogated when we overexpressed c-FLIPL mutants that do not bind Akt . This may means that , by binding to Akt , c-FLIPL relegates the kinase in a different cellular compartment , and abolishes its ability to bind and phosphory-late its substrates . It is interesting that the phosphorylation of other Akt substrates besides Gsk3b , such as BAD , was reduced in c-FLIPL-overexpressing cells data not shown . It has been reported that Gsk3b contributes both to cell death and cell survival , depending on the cellular system and the appropriate stimuli.19 Several studies indicated that inhibition of Gsk3b activity in cancer cells potentates apoptosis stimulated by death receptor.29�32 Furthermore , knocking out Gsk3b or inhibiting Gsk3b using lithium chloride , potentates TNF-induced apoptosis , indicating an anti-apop-totic role for Gsk3b.30 Therefore , we asked whether c-FLIPL-mediated reduction of Gsk3b phosphorylation , and thus increase in its kinase activity , might be necessary for the anti-apoptotic function of c-FLIPL . Interestingly , when we interfered with Gsk3b activity , either using LiCl or with overexpression of a kinase-inactive form of Gsk3 , anti-apoptotic c-FLIPL effects were significantly reduced . Thus , Gsk3b may act as an important mediator that participates in FLIP�s anti-apoptotic function in human cancer . We have recently demonstrated that p27 expression is linked to TRAIL resistance in NSCLC cells overexpressing miR-222.22 We therefore investigated the level of p27 in different cells overexpressing c-FLIPL . Interestingly , we observed an inverse correlation between the c-FLIPL and p27 expression levels , as well as Gsk3b phosphorylation . This was also true in forced c-FLIPL-expressing cells HEK-293 and HeLa . We then investigated whether c-FLIP could affect p27 levels through the activation of Gsk3b . For this purpose , we interfered with Gsk3b expression levels or activity in c-FLIPL-overexpressing cells and evaluated p27 levels . We observed that Gsk3b inhibition increased protein and mRNA levels of p27 . The effects of FLIPL on p27 depend on its interaction with Akt , as c-FLIPL WT overexpression , but not its Akt-binding-site deletion mutants , was able to reduce p27 mRNA level . Recently , Wang et al.21 described that Gsk3b negatively regulates p27 protein in MLL leukemia cells , thus being critical for the maintenance of MLL leukemia , and prospecting Gsk3 as an interesting target for this form of cancer . In the MLL cellular system , the effects were mainly at the protein level because the inhibition of Gsk3b did not affect mRNA levels . Therefore , although the final effect is similar , the functional relationships of Gsk3b with p27 seem to be cell type dependent . Gsk3b is a negative regulator of heart hypertro-phy.33 Interestingly , Hauck34 recently described that silencing p27 induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophyc growth in the absence of growth-factor stimulation . It is interesting to speculate that Gsk3b mediates negative regulation of hypertrophyc growth through its effects on p27 expression levels . Finally , we investigated the mechanisms of c-FLIP�Gsk3b �p27-mediated inhibition of cell death , by the evaluation of protein and mRNA levels of apoptosis-signaling molecules . We showed that the absence of p27 induces a reduction in caspase-3 levels . This effect was mediated by Gsk3b because its inactivation induced an increase in caspase-3 level . The effect was specific on caspase-3 because other apoptosis-signaling molecules , such as FADD , were not affected . This effect occurred at the transcriptional level because c-FLIPL overexpression , but not its mutants , was able to reduce caspase-3 mRNA level , as assessed by RT-PCR . The overexpression of c-FLIPL also induces a significant reduction in the amount of the active caspase in untreated cells . Thus , taken together these data depict a model in which in c-FLIP-overexpressing cells , the activation of Gsk3b induces a reduction in p27Kip1 and caspase-3 expression and activity levels , and thus a reduction in TRAIL-induced cell death Figure 6 . Recently , Gsk3b has been described as a protein complex associated with death receptors , DDX3 , and cellular inhibitor of apoptosis protein-1 cIAP-1 .29 In that study , Gsk3b inhibited apoptosis by interfering with DISC formation and caspase-8 activation . Our data reveal other possible mechan-isms through which Gsk3 might inhibit apoptosis , that is , through regulation of p27 expression and that of downstream caspase-3 Figure 6 . Our data show that c-FLIP overexpression strongly reduces Akt-mediated Gsk3b phosphorylation . Furthermore , it�s down-regulation by a specific c-FLIP siRNA resulted in an increase in Gsk3b phosphorylation , as well as in p27 and caspase-3 levels . In conclusion , this study demonstrates that anti-apoptotic functions of c-FLIPL are mediated by its effects on Gsk3b activity , and p27 and caspase-3 levels . These findings may be of importance in optimizing a strategy for the treatment of TRAIL-resistant human cancer . Figure 6 Role of cFLIP�Gsk3 signaling pathway in the regulation of cell death .

20508647	www.nature.com cdd Ovarian cancer is the fifth most common cancer in women with approximately 22 000 new cases and 15 000 deaths each year in the United States based on National Cancer Institute statistics . Although advances in surgery and chemotherapy have improved the survival rate , the development of resis-tance to chemotherapy continues to be a challenging clinical problem in the treatment of advanced stage ovarian carcino-ma . Thus , greater effort is needed to identify novel therapeutic targets and treatment strategies . Targeting signaling path-ways that are dysregulated in cancer , such as those mediated by transforming growth factor-beta TGFb , is one approach to improving patient survival . TGFb mediates both tumor-suppressing and tumor-promoting activities by 1 repressing transformation in normal cells and 2 increasing aggressive-ness of transformed cells through induction of epithelial� mesenchymal transition EMT , which leads to increased invasion and metastases.1 TGFb regulates target gene expression through SMAD-dependent and SMAD-indepen-dent pathways . Several TGFb signaling mediators are altered during ovarian cancer development including ecotropic viral integration site-1 EVI1 , 2,3 SnoN SkiL , 4 and TGFbRII , and PI3K AKT.1,3 In ovarian cancers , suggested mechanisms for resistance to TGFb-mediated growth inhibition include decreased expression of TGFb receptors , repression by oncoproteins EVI1 and SnoN , dysregulation of RUNX1 activation , and activation of additional pathways such as PKC.1 Arsenic trioxide As2O3 , used in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia APL , 5 is active in vitro in several solid tumor cell lines , including ovarian cancer cells.6�8 In human ovarian carcinoma cell lines , As2O3 is highly cytotoxic , inducing apoptosis , necrosis , autophagy , and inhibiting invasion.6,8,9 The mechanism of action of As2O3 is unclear . Interestingly , in primary murine leukemia cells , 2�10 mM As2O3 is involved in proteasome degradation of EVI1 , a well-known TGFb signaling repressor.10 To analyze the mechanism of drug-induced cell death , we examined the effects of As2O3 on TGFb signaling mediators in ovarian cells . As2O3 markedly altered protein levels of EVI1 , SnoN , TGFbRII , as well as other key TGFb signaling mediators , including SMAD2 3 and AKT . EVI1 protein expression was restored by MG132 PS-341 treatment suggesting that As2O3-induced effects on EVI1 is regulated through the proteasome degradation pathway . As2O3 elicited a marked functional effect on cell growth and apoptosis in a number of ovarian cell lines , which correlated with multidrug resistance protein 1 MRP1 protein expression . siRNA targeting ATG5 , ATG7 , and hVps34 markedly reduced autophagy in As2O3-treated ovarian carcinoma cells in contrast to beclin-1 knockdown , which had no effect implicating a beclin-1-independent mechanism in As2O3-induced autophagy . Moreover , SnoN altered cellular sensitivity to apoptosis by modulating LC3-II levels . Our results implicate SnoN as a potential target for therapy because it promotes cell survival through modulation of autophagy and apoptosis . Results As2O3 alters expression of TGFb signaling mediators in ovarian cancer cells . To determine the mechanism of action of As2O3 in ovarian cancer cell lines , we initially determined its effect on the expression of TGFb signaling mediators including EVI1 , which is amplified at 3q26.2 in ovarian cancers.2 We treated HEY and OVCA429 cells high-EVI1 expressing cell lines for 18 h with increasing doses of As2O3 Figure 1a and Supplementary Figure 1a . As2O3 markedly decreased protein levels of several EVI1 forms in both cell lines including MDS1 EVI1 which consists of sequences derived from both EVI1 and the MDS1 gene , located telomeric to EVI1 , 11 full-length EVI1 , and EVI1Del190 515 similar to the identified D324 isoform isolated from human endometrial carcinoma cells .12,13 In contrast , As2O3 significantly increased SnoN SkiL levels , also ampli-fied at the 3q26.2 locus in ovarian cancers.4 Other TGFb mediators markedly reduced by As2O3 treatment include 1 TGFb activating kinase 1 TAK1 , which phosphory-lates SnoN targeting it for degradation , 14 2 SMAD2 3 , 3 TGFbRII , which is downregulated in advanced stage ovarian carcinomas relative to normal epithelium3 western analysis shows multiple bands likely reflecting heterogeneity of the receptor , and 4 AKT , which can signal through the TGFb pathway by binding to SMAD3.15 Thus , these data show that As2O3 markedly alters expression of key TGFb signaling mediators in ovarian cancer cells . As2O3 induces the degradation of TGFb signaling mediators through proteasome-dependent and -independent pathways . To determine whether alterations in expression of TGFb signaling mediators after treatment with As2O3 were due to proteasome-mediated degradation , we performed combinatorial studies with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 . We used As2O3 at 5 mM with 5 mM MG132 , which elicited minimal cellular toxicity compared with higher doses . The response of HEY and OVCA429 to these drug combinations were similar Figure 1b and Supple-mentary Figure 1b . Both EVI1 and EVI1Del190 515 protein expression were reduced with 5 mM As2O3 whereas there was little effect on MDS1 EVI1 Figure 1b .10 The reduction of EVI1 and EVI1Del190 515 expression with As2O3 was recovered with MG132 , suggesting that As2O3 induces the degradation of certain EVI1 forms through a proteasome-mediated pathway . In contrast , TGFbRII was not markedly recovered after 6 or 18h treatment with MG132 , suggesting that As2O3-induced degradation of TGFbRII likely occurs through a proteasome-independent pathway . Strikingly , SnoN levels were further increased with MG132 , suggesting that SnoN protein can be further stabilized through a proteasome-mediated pathway . Similar effects were observed with PS-341 Bortezomid Velcade , another proteasome inhibitor Figure 1c . SMURF2 E3 ubiquitin ligase is involved in geldanamycin-induced TGFbRII degradation.16 However , treatment of OVCA429 and HEY ovarian cancer cells with SMURF2 siRNA 490 % reduction in SMURF2 protein did not significantly alter EVI1 , SnoN , or TGFbRII protein in the presence of As2O3 Supplementary Figure 1c suggesting other E3 ubiquitin ligases are involved in As2O3-induced degradation of TGFbRII , SnoN , or EVI1 . We next assessed whether As2O3-induced alterations in AKT , SMAD2 3 , and TGFbRII protein with MG132 were due to changes in 1 protein expression independent of the proteasome or 2 RNA levels . MG132 treatment at 18 h not only significantly decreased their protein levels Figure 1d and Supplementary Figure 1d , but markedly reduced EVI1 and TGFbRII RNA levels Figure 1e and Supplementary Figure 1e . We also examined the effect of As2O3 on RNA levels Figure 1e because As2O3 can alter RNA expression such as survivin.17,18 However , we observed o20 % decrease in EVI1 and TGFbRII RNA levels with little effect on SnoN RNA . Collectively , these results suggest that As2O3-induced expression changes occur mostly at the protein level . Decreased sensitivity to As2O3-induced cell death in ovarian cells expressing high MRP1 protein . To examine the functional effects of As2O3 on both normal and ovarian cancer cells , we assessed its effects on cell growth in 1 T80 , a large T antigen hTERT immortalized normal ovarian surface epithelial cell line low-expressing EVI1 cell line , 2 HEY moderate-expressing EVI1 cell line , and 3 SKOV3 , high-expressing EVI1 cell line .2 We previously reported the expression profile of EVI1 in these ovarian cells.2 High-expressing EVI1 cells HEY and SKOV3 were more resistant to effects of As2O3 compared with low-EVI1 expressing cells T80 based on cell viability assays Figure 2a . On microscopic examination , we observed that these cells developed numerous cytoplasmic vacuoles and were apoptotic as evidenced by apoptotic morphology and substratum release Figure 2b . Staining with annexin b d V-FITC and propidium iodide PI to quantify changes in apoptosis indicated that , after As2O3 treatment , normal ovarian cells T80 had a markedly higher apoptotic percen-tage 480 % compared with ovarian cancer cells SKOV3 a c d and HEY o20 % Figure 2c . These results indicate that normal ovarian cells T80 are more sensitive to As2O3-induced apoptosis compared with cancer cells HEY and SKOV3 . In contrast , As2O3 reduced the migratory potential of both normal and cancer cell lines similarly by 450 % Supplementary Figure 2 . As As2O3 has been reported to reduce intracellular glutathione GSH levels , 19 we next assessed whether GSH levels in T80 , HEY , and SKOV3 cells may be correlated with the sensitivity to As2O3 . All cell lines had reduced GSH levels after As2O3 treatment with markedly reduced levels in normal immortalized ovarian T80 cells compared with HEY and SKOV3 Figure 2d . As GSH can bind to trivalent arsenic and is effluxed out of cells through MRP1,20 we thus analyzed the level of MRP1 protein in these ovarian cell lines . Indeed , we found that MRP1 was highly expressed in SKOV3 and HEY cells highly resistant to As2O3-mediated effects and low in T80 cells Figure 2e . Together , these results suggest that the decreased sensitivity to As2O3 in ovarian carcinoma cells may be due to increased efflux of GSH-As2O3 through MRP1 . As2O3 induces formation of autophagosomes . As formation of cytoplasmic vacuoles with As2O3 treatment was suggestive of induction of autophagy see Figure 2b , we first examined protein expression of microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 LC3 , a marker of autophagic vesicle formation . As2O3 increased levels of both the LC3-I cytosolic form , 18 kDa and LC3-II membrane-bound form , 16 kDa , which correlated with SnoN expression at 10�25 mM in T80 HEY cells and 425 mM in SKOV3 cells Figure 3a . p62 SQSTM1 , which recruits autophagic machinery to inclusion bodies as a protective response for clearing protein aggregates through the autophagic pathway , 21 also increased in a dose-dependent manner . In addition , poly ADP-ribose polymerase 116 kDa , PARP , which is proteolytically fragmented to 89 and 24 kDa early marker of apoptosis by caspase-3 , which precedes DNA fragmentation , dramatically increased at a dose of 25 mM T80 and 50 mM HEY and SKOV3 correlating with the apoptotic sensitivity determined by Annexin V staining see Figure 2c . As the development of cytoplasmic vacuoles at 18 h treatment preceded apoptosis as determined by light micro-scopy Figure 3b , we performed a kinetic profile to follow these events in a time-dependent manner with respect to expression of TGFb mediators Figure 3c . We observed induction of SnoN at 9 h As2O3 treatment , which correlated with changes in LC3-II and p62 . We observed dramatic decreases in EVI1 , TAK1 , SMAD2 3 , and TGFbRII expres-sion levels at 18 h treatment , which correlated with marked increases in the LC3-I II ratio as well as reduction in procaspase-3 and increased cleaved PARP . Induction of another potential splice variant of EVI1 B60 kDa , detected using an antibody , which detects multiple splice forms of EVI1 followed levels of cleaved PARP . These results provide evidence for the correlation of the induction of expression of SnoN with the autophagic marker , LC3-II , which precedes changes in apoptotic markers . Interestingly , beclin-1 levels did not increase but decreased after 18 h treatment . We next identified the presence of autophagosomes by transmission electron microscopy TEM . By TEM , we positively identified the presence of numerous double-membrane autophagosomes with As2O3 treatment Figures 3d and e . After 3 h As2O3 treatment , formation of double-membrane structures was observed . At 9 h , auto-phagosomes were fully formed and at 18 h , clearing within autophagosomes was observed suggesting degradation of the cytoplasmic contents Figure 3e . Beyond 18 h , the cells underwent apoptosis results not shown . In addition , we transfected EGFP�LC3 cDNA into HEY cells to identify fluorescent vacuoles after As2O3 treatment and observed a punctate staining pattern around the nucleus with 5 mM to 25 mM As2O3 compared with diffuse EGFP fluorescence in untreated cells 0 mM As2O3 see Figures 5a and b . Collectively , these results show that As2O3 induces the development of autophagosomes in parallel with induction of SnoN protein , which precedes changes in apoptotic markers . As2O3 mediates its effects in ovarian cells through the generation of reactive oxygen species ROS . To determine whether the As2O3-induced changes observed in expression of TGFb signaling mediators are due to the effects of oxidative stress , we treated HEY cells with As2O3 in combination with the antioxidant N-acetyl-L-cysteine NAC , a free radical scavenger reducing agent and GSH precursor , which protects against As2O3-induced apoptosis in tumor cells.22 Light micrographs of cells co-treated with 10 mM As2O3 and 1000 mM NAC showed a dramatic reduction in cytoplasmic vacuolation and apoptotic morphology in contrast to cells treated with 10 mM As2O3 alone Figure 4a . Further , increasing doses of NAC markedly reduced SnoN with a corresponding recovery in EVI1 and TGFbRII proteins Figure 4b , left panel . The results indicate that TGFb signaling mediator expression can be altered by the presence of ROS . Although the levels of p62 remained unchanged or increased slightly , there was a reduction in LC3-I levels Figure 4b , right panel . Further , we observed a dramatic reduction in punctate EGFP�LC3 staining suggesting As2O3-induced autophagy can be reversed by addition of antioxidant Figure 4c , top and bottom panels . We observed an increase in cell survival after co-treatment with 10 mM As2O3 and 1000 mM NAC Figure 4d indicating that NAC promotes increased cellular viability . As the level of cleaved PARP was difficult to detect at 10 mM As2O3 Figure 4b , right panel , we quantified changes in apoptosis by staining with annexin V-FITC and PI . We observed a significant decrease in apoptotic cells on co-treatment with 10 mM As2O3 and NAC compared with As2O3-only treated cells Figure 4e . Together , these results suggest that As2O3 mediates its effects through the generation of ROS , which alters the autophagic and apoptotic response . As2O3 induces autophagy through a beclin-1 - independent pathway . To determine whether autophagy is a necessary step in induction of cell death through As2O3 , we tested the effects of various inhibitors of autophagy and apoptosis . 3-Methyladenine 3-MA is a class III phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase PI3K inhibitor that inhibits autophagy at the earliest stage of autophagosome forma-tion and is associated with decreased LC3-II expression.23 Although SnoN levels were not dramatically altered in HEY cells co-treated with As2O3 and 3-MA , there was reduced formation of EGFP�LC3 punctae Figures 5a and b , decreased LC3 protein , and increased cleaved PARP used as marker of apoptosis in contrast to cells treated with 25 mM As2O3 alone Figure 5c . Although beclin-1 levels were previously reported to be suppressed by 3-MA treatment , 24 we did not detect any marked changes in beclin-1 levels in HEY cells co-treated with 3-MA and As2O3 Figure 5c . Moreover , addition of 3-MA to resveratrol-treated ovarian cells failed to elicit a marked change in beclin-1 or LC3 expression Supplementary Figures 3a and b . In contrast , nutrient starvation with EBSS markedly increased both LC3 and beclin-1 levels , which were both reduced after treatment with 3-MA Supplementary Figures 4a and b . We next analyzed the effect of bafilomycin A1 BAF , a late-stage autophagy inhibitor that hinders fusion of lysosomes to autophagosomes leading to inhibition of the degradation of inner contents and accumulation of uncleaved LC3-II protein.25 Western analysis of HEY cells co-treated with As2O3 and BAF showed increased LC3-II and cleaved PARP levels Figure 5d , left panel . These results suggest that inhibition of late stage autophagy leads to increased apoptosis . Further , SnoN levels were slightly reduced with BAF in the presence of As2O3 suggesting a role for SnoN in this process . In addition , we analyzed the effect of zVAD-fmk , a caspase inhibitor , which inhibits apoptosis , to provide additional evidence that As2O3 - induced autophagy is independent of apoptosis.26 Although the levels of SnoN and LC3 remained unchanged with increasing concentrations of zVAD-fmk Figure 5d , right panel , cleaved PARP was markedly reduced suggesting decreased apoptosis . Collectively , these results suggest that As2O3-induced autophagy confers a protective role against apoptosis , which is the primary cell death mechanism induced by As2O3 . As these inhibitors can induce nonspecific effects , we thus assessed knockdown of specific ATG genes on autophagy and apoptosis in HEY cells . Several key regulators of autophagy were detectable by western analysis in ovarian cells such as hVps34 , beclin-1 , ATG5 , and ATG7 Figure 5e . Although knockdown of beclin-1 by siRNA treatment for 2 consecutive days effectively 495 % reduced protein expression Figure 5f , it did not affect expression of LC3-II LC3-I Figure 5f or significantly modulate formation of LC3 punctae induced by As2O3 Figures 5g and h . In contrast , ATG5 , ATG7 , and hVps34 siRNA markedly altered the ratio of LC3-II LC3-I Figure 5f and LC3 punctae formation Figures 5g and h . Staining with annexin V-FITC and PI showed only subtle changes in the apoptotic response with ATG siRNAs Figure 5i . Furthermore , we assessed beclin-1 knockdown with EBSS treatment , which led to reduced LC3-II levels Supplementary Figure 4c . However , we could not accurately assess the effect of EBSS on LC3 punctae formation because of the dramatically altered cell morphology i.e. , cell rounding . Together , these results suggest that As2O3 elicits its effects on autophagy in a beclin-1-independent manner . Modulation of the sensitivity of ovarian cancer cells to As2O3 by SnoN knockdown . As we observed that SnoN levels paralleled those of LC3 , we analyzed whether SnoN could alter LC3-II levels and production of autophagosomes . Light microscopy suggests that knockdown of SnoN increases the sensitivity of the cells to As2O3 treatment leading to increased cell death compared with control siRNA-treated cells Figure 6a . In SnoN knockdown cells 490 % decrease in SnoN protein treated with As2O3 , western analysis showed a marked reduction in LC3-II and p62 levels with an increase in cleaved PARP compared with control siRNA cells treated with 25 mM As2O3 Figure 6b . These protein changes corresponded with a reduction in EGFP� LC3 punctae Figure 6c , a marked reduction in cell survival Figure 6d , and increased levels of apoptosis determined by annexin V-FITC and PI staining Figure 6e . Thus , these data suggest that the sensitivity to As2O3-induced autophagy and apoptosis can be modulated by altering SnoN levels . qPCR measurements of LC3 RNA transcripts indicated that its levels are low and SnoN siRNA did not modulate a b d LC3 RNA transcripts results not shown suggesting alternative mechanisms other than direct transcriptional regulation of LC3 by SnoN . As low-and high-expressing EVI1 ovarian cell lines differed in their response to the apoptotic effects of As2O3 see Figures 2a and b , we assessed the effect of EVI1 siRNA on the sensitivity of ovarian cancer cells to As2O3 . However , EVI1 siRNA 490 % reduction in wild-type EVI1 protein did not dramatically alter As2O3-induced sensitivity to apoptosis based on PARP cleavage levels or alter autophagy based on western analysis of LC3-II levels results not shown . SnoN is reported to be degraded on TGFb stimulation by TAK1 through the ubiquitin-dependent proteasome path-way.14 As we observed that As2O3 treatment decreased TAK1 , we next assessed whether reducing TAK1 levels could alter As2O3-induced changes in SnoN and thus , modulate the autophagic pathway . However , TAK1 siRNA treatment 480 % knockdown did not modulate SnoN levels , alter the sensitivity of ovarian cancer cells to As2O3 , or modulate p62 and LC3 protein levels Figure 7a . However , knockdown of AKT , which lies downstream to PI3K27 and is a promising target for therapy in ovarian carcinomas , 28,29 did not modulate expression of TGFb signaling mediators , but did increase PARP cleavage while decreasing p62 levels and LC3-II LC3-I levels Figure 7b suggesting that AKT has a role in modulating the apoptotic and autophagic pathways . Discussion As successful treatment of cancer cells with chemothera-peutic drugs is dependent on their ability to trigger cell death , it is critical to understand their mechanisms of action . In this study , we report that As2O3 , commonly used to treat APL , can target TGFb signaling mediators through proteasome-dependent i.e. , EVI1 and TGFbRII and -independent pathways SMAD2 3 and AKT in ovarian cancer cell lines . The increased sensitivity of EVI1 forms to As2O3 after long-term treatments 18 h could be due to their inherent protein stability and long half-life . These As2O3-induced effects on EVI1 are similar to the reported effects in leukemia cell lines.10 In our studies , we observed different sensitivities to As2O3 among the three ovarian cell lines assessed low-T80 and high-SKOV3 and HEY expressing EVI1 ovarian cell lines suggesting that the sensitivity of ovarian cell lines to As2O3 may correlate with EVI1 protein expression . However , knock-down of EVI1 siRNA designed against exon VII failed to alter the sensitivity to As2O3-induced apoptosis . There are numerous other factors likely dictating cellular resistance or sensitivity to As2O3 including 1 GSH levels , 2 enzymes involved in biosynthesis of GSH , 3 enzymes using GSH glutathione-S-transferase , 4 free radical scavenging and peroxide metabolism GSH peroxidase , catalase , and 5 MRP1 levels , which is involved in the efflux of As2O3 in drug-resistant cell lines . Indeed , we observed that MRP1 is highly expressed in both HEY and SKOV3 cells , which could result in resistance to As2O3 . As2O3 treatment dramatically elevated SnoN levels likely mediated through a ROS-dependent pathway Figure 4b . As2O3 treatment can generate ROS , a form of oxidative stress , which can induce autophagy . Superoxide anion appears to be the major ROS regulating autophagic pro-cess.30 As ROS oxidizes cellular lipids , proteins , and DNA causing cellular damage , autophagy serves to prevent accumulation of these damaged toxic products and organelles by sequestering these cellular components into autophago-somes double-membraned vesicles , which fuse with lyso-somes for degradation . Specifically , ROS can oxidize the cysteine protease , ATG4 , involved in initiating the conjugation of LC3-I to autophagosomal membranes and its consequent release from the autophagophore membrane.31 We also observed that As2O3 treatment elevated SnoN levels in a TAK1-independent manner Figure 7a . Interest-ingly , normal epithelial cells treated with TRAIL induced cytoprotective autophagy mediated through TAK1 , which activates AMP-activated protein kinase leading to inhibition of mammalian target of rapamycin I.32 However , under our assay conditions , we did not detect changes in autophagy or apoptosis on depletion of TAK1 in HEY ovarian carcinoma cells see Figure 7a . Signaling pathways determining whether cells undergo autophagy or apoptosis are complex . In malignant glioma cells , As2O3 seems to initiate an autophagic response that leads to cell death.33 This contrasts to our data in ovarian cell lines based on inhibitor studies with 3-MA and zVAD-fmk suggesting cell-type-specific effects of As2O3 . Indeed , auto-phagy has been described as a �double-edged sword� promoting 1 survival in response to stress and starvation as well as 2 programmed cell death.34 Recently , autophagy-related proteins such as beclin-1 or ATG5 12 do not seem to be required for the autophagic process suggesting alternative non-canonical macroautophagy pathways.35,36 In our ovarian carcinoma cells , beclin-1 seemed to be dispensable for inducing As2O3-mediated autophagic response but was dependent on hVps34 . SnoN protein not only paralleled the autophagy marker LC3-II but knockdown of SnoN altered LC3-II I ratios suggesting that this protein lies downstream to SnoN . Other mediators important in As2O3-induced programmed cell death include p21 , which itself leads to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis.37 Indeed , we have previously shown that SnoN knockdown increases p21 protein levels.4 Thus , SnoN may have a key role in autophagy to promote cell survival as a protective mechanism against As2O3-induced cell death Figure 8 . The mechanism by which SnoN alters autophago-some development is presently under investigation . Cell lines and cell culture . The following ovarian cell lines were used for the studies reported herein T antigen hTERT immortalized normal ovarian surface epithelial cells T80 as well as several ovarian carcinoma cell lines , including SKOV3 amplification at the EVI1 locus , HEY high-expressing EVI1 cell line , and OVCA429 high-expressing EVI1 cell line .2 Cell lines were cultured in RPMI 1640 with 8 % FBS and penicillin streptomycin and maintained in an incubator with a humidified atmosphere containing 95 % air and 5 % CO2 at 37 1C .

As2O3 diffuses into the cell through the cell membrane leading to a reduction in intracellular GSH levels and an increase in ROS which through unknown mechanisms lead to increases in SnoN levels . SnoN alters LC3-II expression , a marker of autophagosome maturation , suggesting that SnoN can induce autophagy . Induction of autophagy seems to be a protective mechanism of cell survival following As2O3 treatment in ovarian cells . In high MRP1-expressing cell lines , As2O3 is effluxed through these channels resulting in reduced sensitivity to As2O3-induced apoptosis Primers probe sequences for SnoN Hs00180524_m1 , TGFbRII Hs00234253_m1 , and LC3 Hs00261291_m1 were obtained from Applied Biosystems Assays by design . mRNA levels were determined using the One-Step-Plus Applied Biosystems Detection System using b-actin as a reference .

20559320	E2F-1 regulation by an unusual DP partner subunit L Ingram1,2 , S Munro1,2 , AS Coutts1 and NB La Thangue* , 1 The E2F family of transcription factors regulate a variety of cellular outcomes , including cell cycle progression , differen-tiation and apoptosis.1,2 The first member of the family to be identified , E2F-1 , is a crucial target of the retinoblastoma pRb tumour suppressor protein in the control of the G1-to S-phase transition.3,4 pRb physically interacts with DNA-bound E2F-1 and thereby prevents transcriptional activity.5 In turn , cell cycle progression can not occur , which is important for pRb to exert its tumour suppressor activity.5 To date , eight E2F subunits have been identified , together with three DP subunits.6 E2F-7 and E2F-8 , the two most recently charac-terized members of the family , possess unusual properties , with two DNA-binding domains that allow DNA binding to occur independently of a DP subunit.7�11 In mammalian cells , however , most of the E2F exists as a heterodimer in complex with a DP subunit.6 Under normal physiological conditions DP-1 is the pre-dominant E2F partner protein.12,13 DP-1 is encoded by an essential gene , as dp-1 mice show embryonic lethality , in part due to defective extraembryonic tissue development.14 Furthermore , DP-1 phosphorylation is regulated during cell cycle progression , and its phosphorylation by cyclinA cdk2 kinase is believed to be involved in controlling the DNA-binding activity of the E2F heterodimer and exit from S phase.15 Another member of the DP family , murine DP-3 human DP-2 , undergoes complex levels of control , and a variety of protein isoforms exist in cells that differ in both biochemical and functional properties.16,17 The most recent DNA damage-responsive family member to be described , DP-4 , acts negatively on both E2F DNA-binding activity and cell cycle progression.18�20 In this study we describe some unexpected properties of the newest member of the DP family , DP-4 , and highlight a novel pathway that allows pRb-independent negative control of E2F-1 activity . We have found that DP-4 is DNA damage responsive , which leads to the downregulation of E2F-1 activity by creating an E2F-1 DP-4 complex that can not bind to DNA . Consequently , depleting DP-4 re-instates E2F-1 DNA-binding activity , which coincides with increased expres-sion of a variety of E2F-1 target genes and enhanced levels of apoptosis . Significantly , a domain that resides in the C-terminal region of DP-4 is responsible for downregulating E2F-1 activity . Our results define a new pathway , which acts independently of pRb and through a biochemically distinct mechanism , to regulate E2F-1 activity . Results DP-4 is DNA damage responsive . An analysis of DP-4 using a DP-4-specific antibody indicated that it is a nuclear protein expressed in a variety of different cancer cell lines Figure 1a�c Supplementary Figure 1a and b . In characterizing the properties of DP-4 , we considered that its expression might be influenced by DNA damage . DP-4 was DNA damage inducible in different cell types U2OS , HeLa , MCF7 , HEK293 and H1299 treated with doxorubicin , etoposide and ultraviolet UV light Figure 1c�f Supplementary Figure 1c and d , contrasting with DP-1 that was not induced by DNA damage see , e.g. , Figure 1d . Endogenous DP-4 was located in nuclei , although under DNA damage conditions there was a significant increase in protein level and nuclear staining intensity Figure 1c and Supplementary Figure 1e . Although a significant increase was observed at the protein level , DP-4 mRNA levels only underwent a modest increase after DNA damage Supplementary Figure 1f . Furthermore , the DNA damage-dependent increase in DP-4 protein levels reflected increased levels of the DP-4 E2F-1 heterodimer when either the ectopic or endogenous proteins were measured Figure 1f and g . These results therefore establish that DP-4 is DNA damage responsive , and that , in addition , DNA damage favours formation of the E2F-1 DP4 heterodimer . To examine the effect of DP-4 on transcription , we tested the functional consequences of DP-4 expression on a collection of E2F-responsive promoters , namely apoptotic protease-activating factor 1 Apaf1 , Cdc6 , p73 and cyclin E.5,21 Although each promoter was activated by E2F-1 , coexpressing DP-4 resulted in reduced levels of transcription Figure 2a . The effect of DP-4 contrasted with DP-1 , which augmented transcription Figure 2a ectopic protein levels were expressed as expected in transfected cells Figure 2a . Thus , DP-4 inactivates transcription , and has the opposite effect compared with DP-1 on E2F site transcription . To establish that the effect of ectopic DP-4 recapitulated effects on endogenous genes , we used small interfering RNA siRNA to deplete endogenous DP-4 , and thereafter monitored the effect on E2F target genes . Under conditions of DP-4 depletion Figure 2b , the levels of both RNA and protein encoded by different E2F target genes , including Cdc2 , Apaf1 , p73 and E2F-1 , increased Figure 2c and d . Thus , DP-4 is a negative regulator of E2F target genes . DP-4 hinders E2F-1 DNA binding . To address the mechanisms responsible for downregulating E2F activity , we considered that DP-4 might compete with DP-1 for binding to the E2F subunit . Under conditions in which E2F-1 and DP-1 were able to activate transcription , there was a titratable decline in transcription as the level of DP-4 increased Figure 3a . Conversely , the downregulation of E2F transcription by DP-4 could be overcome by increasing the level of DP-1 Figure 3b . These results suggest that DP-4 acts competitively with DP-1 . We next investigated whether the integrity of the DP-4 DNA-binding domain was necessary for DP-4 to downregulate E2F site transcription . We tested this possibility by manipulating DP-4 in two ways . First , we removed the conserved and essential RRXYD DNA-binding consensus motif RRTYD in DP-4 Figure 4a and b to create a DP-4 derivative that was defective in DNA binding D162�166 . Second , an alignment of DP-1 with DP-4 highlighted a number of subunit-specific amino acid residues within the DNA-binding and dimerization domains Figure 4a and b that , from inspection of the structure of the E2F heterodimer , 22 might be expected to influence DNA-binding activity Figure 4a . We therefore prepared a series of derivatives in which each one of the different residues was serially substituted into DP-4 the DP-1 residue replacing each of the different DP-4 residues , eventually giving rise to the DP-4*4 in which all the relevant DP-1-specific residues were transferred into DP-4 Figure 4b . Each mutant derivative was subsequently tested for its ability to downregulate E2F site-dependent transcrip-tion . Neither DP-4D162�166 nor any of the DP-4 derivatives were compromised in their ability to downregulate transcrip-tion , and each mutant was expressed at a similar level Figure 4c and d . The fact that DP-4D162�166 , which lacks residues that are essential for DNA binding , 22 retained the ability to downregulate transcription strongly suggests that DNA binding is not necessary for the effects of DP-4 on E2F site transcription . This idea is consistent with the properties of the DP-4 substitution mutants Figure 4d that similarly were able to downregulate transcription . Overall , DP-4 down-regulates E2F site transcription in a manner that does not require the integrity of the DNA-binding domain . We prepared a series of DP-4 deletion mutants to identify the domain in DP-4 that is responsible for the control of E2F activity . Derivatives lacking the N-terminal region of DP-4 , up to residue 174 , which removed the DNA-binding and dimerization domain Figure 5a , could downregulate trans-cription Figure 5b and c . Furthermore , although a C-terminal deletion up to residue 306 could downregulate E2F-1 activity , further deletion up to residue 206 diminished this activity , and a deletion up to residue 106 completely abolished this activity Figure 5a and b . Significantly , DP-4N174 , which lacks DNA-binding activity , could compete with DP-1 for E2F-1 activity Figure 5c . These results suggest that the region required for DP-4 to downregulate E2F site transcription lies between residue 175 and 306 . As the DNA-binding and dimerization domain resides between residue 108 and 174 , these results further confirm that DP-4 DNA-binding and dimerization activity is unlikely to be involved in the effects on E2F activity . This idea is consistent with the properties of DP-4 N174 , which lacks DNA-binding and dimerization activity but retains the ability to reduce transcriptional activation when coexpressed with E2F-1 DP-1 Figure 5c . DP-4 hinders E2F DNA-binding activity . However , it remained possible that DP-4 affects the DNA-binding activity of E2F-1 , which we tested by assessing the effect of DP-4 on chromatin-bound E2F-1 . First , we monitored the effect of ectopic DP-4 on E2F-1 activity by chromatin immunoprecipitation ChIP and , second , the effect of DP-4 siRNA on chromatin-bound endogenous E2F-1 . Although ectopic DP-1 was detected on the promoter of the E2F-1 and Cdc2 genes , ectopic DP-4 was not Figure 6a , despite expression of equivalent levels of the ectopic protein Figure 6a , iii . The effect of DP-4 on E2F-1 contrasted with DP-1 , which enhanced E2F-1 binding Figure 6a . Frequently , ectopic DP-4 even reduced E2F-1 binding to E2F target genes e.g. , the E2F-1 promoter Figure 6a . These results suggest that DP-4 fails to locate to the chromatin of E2F target genes , which is compatible with the earlier results indicating that DNA binding is not required for the transcription effects of DP-4 . To test whether endogenous DP-4 behaved in a similar manner with the ectopic protein , we performed a ChIP analysis on DP-4 siRNA-treated cells Figure 6b . Under conditions of DP-4 depletion , E2F-1 underwent increased binding to the promoters of E2F target genes , in both unperturbed and DNA-damaged cells Figure 6b and c . These results support the data obtained with ectopic DP-4 Figure 6a , and suggest that endogenous DP-4 down-regulates the expression of E2F target genes through modulating access of E2F-1 to chromatin . Physiological role of DP-4 . Given the induction of DP-4 under DNA damage conditions , together with its ability to downregulate E2F-1 activity , we reasoned that DP-4 may take on an important role in mediating the cell cycle effects of DNA damage . This possibility was tested by depleting endogenous DP-4 and thereafter analysing the effect on cell cycle progression . In different cell types U2OS and SAOS2 , depletion of DP-4 caused a decrease in the population of G1 cells , with increased levels of S and G2 M cells Figure 7a and c Supplementary Figure 1g . In contrast , under DNA damage conditions , reduced levels of DP-4 coincided with a dramatic increase in sub-G1 0.79 to 18.4 % , together with a decreased population of G1 cells Figure 7a and c . These results suggest that DP-4 influences cell cycle progression , under both normal and DNA damage conditions . Furthermore , as E2F-1 activity increases in DP-4 siRNA-treated cells , and because E2F-1 can induce apoptosis , 23,24 we tested the effect of DP-4 on E2F-1-induced apoptosis . There was a reduction in the level of apoptosis measured as poly ADP-ribose polymerase PARP cleavage when DP-4 was coexpressed with E2F-1 Figure 7d . Overall , therefore , DP-4 is functionally involved in regulating cell cycle progres-sion as well as the outcome of the DNA damage response . Discussion DP-4 and the DNA damage response . An important property that distinguishes DP-4 from other members of the DP family is the ability to downregulate transcription , and its induction during the DNA damage response . Most interestingly , DP-4 carries a domain in the C-terminal region that is responsible for downregulating transcription in a manner that is independent of DNA-binding domain . The idea that DP-4 DNA-binding activity is not required to downregulate transcription is compatible with the absence of DP-4 on the promoters of E2F target genes , even in conditions of ectopic protein expression . It is most likely therefore that DP-4 interacts with E2F-1 in a manner that prevents E2F-1 binding to the promoters of target genes Figure 7e . By studying cells in which DP-4 had been depleted , it was apparent that DP-4 regulates the G1 population and con-tributes to the cell cycle arrest that occurs upon DNA damage . The increased population of apoptotic sub-G1 cells upon depleting DP-4 is consistent with a role for DP-4 in assisting cell survival upon DNA damage . Furthermore , the level of E2F-1-dependent apoptosis was reduced in the presence of DP-4 , suggesting that DP-4 activity antagonizes apoptosis driven by E2F-1 . The ability of DP-4 to augment the G1 population in both unperturbed and DNA-damaged cells might therefore reflect decreased E2F-1 activity , and consequently reduced apoptosis Figure 7e . Together , our results suggest that DP-4 is a functionally distinct member of the DP family , with the ability to negatively regulate E2F-1 . Negative regulation of E2F-1 independently of pRb . The properties of DP-4 define a new mechanism through which E2F-1 activity can be negatively regulated but , importantly , provide a pathway that operates in a pRb-independent manner . pRb and the related family members p107 and p130 bind to specific E2F subunits through a domain required for transcriptional activation , and the interaction prevents transcriptional activation by the E2F subunit.5,24 Under normal cell cycle conditions , the sequential phosphorylation of pRb directed by cyclin Cdk complexes releases pRb from E2F-1 , thereby facilitating the activation of E2F target genes.25 It is possible that the ability of DP-4 to hinder E2F-1 DNA-binding activity , and thereby limit the level of E2F-1-dependent transcription , provides an alternative biochemically distinct pathway for downregulating E2F-1 activity . In conclusion , our results have unearthed an unexpected yet central role for DP-4 in regulating E2F-1 activity . DP-4 down-regulates E2F-1 , and the widespread expression of DP-4 suggests that this is a general mechanism used in many different types of cells . DP-4 therefore contributes to a new pRb-independent mechanism for regulating cell cycle progression . Materials and Methods Plasmids and expression vectors .

20596076	EB Babiychuk* , 1 , K Monastyrskaya1 , S Potez1 and A Draeger1 Physical disruption of the plasma membrane is common in cells that operate under conditions of mechanical stress.1,2 The permeability barrier can also be breached by chemical means pathogens gain access to host cells by secreting pore-forming toxins and phospholipases , and the host�s own immune system uses pore-forming proteins to eliminate both pathogens and the pathogen-invaded cells.3�5 Nucleated cells survive the disruption of their plasma membrane by a process of resealing.1,2,6�9 If resealing fails , the intracellular contents are lost . But irreversible damage can occur even before this event if the influx of extracellular Ca2 ? is not restrained.9�11 An abrupt elevation in the intracellular con-centration of Ca2 ? [ Ca2 ? ] i activates intracellular protei-nases and phospholipases , thereby causing generalized damage to the phospholipid bilayer and the cytoskeleton.2,12 It is thus hardly surprising that an elevation in [ Ca2 ? ] i is sensed as an �immediate danger� signal by an injured cell.2,13,14 In injured cells the influx of extracellular Ca2 ? triggers a process of plasma membrane blebbing , which is often considered to be a harbinger of cell death.15�22 Blebs are sprouted by cells whose plasma membrane has become locally detached from the actin cortex.15�19 The detachment and surge of cytoplasm into the newly formed blebs are driven by a contraction of the cortical actomyosin , which generates hydrostatic pressure and thus drives herniations of the plasma membrane.19,23 Consequently , blebbing can be triggered by a variety of Ca2 ? -dependent or Ca2 ? -independent mechan-isms that are known to activate myosin or to induce a rearrangement of cytoskeletal and cortical structures.18,24 Blebbing is manifested in a number of physiological pro-cesses , such as cytokinesis , cell spreading and locomo-tion.15�19 However , it is most commonly associated with cell injury and apoptosis.17,18,20�22 Albeit so , the specific role of blebbing in physiological and pathological processes is still controversial.17,18 In this study , we present a hitherto unknown role of blebbing as a mechanism of resistance to plasmalemmal injury . In this capacity , blebs act as a trap for the damaged membrane segment and its adjoining cytosol , and are sealed off from the cell body by plugs of annexin A1 � a Ca2 ? -and membrane-binding protein.25 Following plasmalemmal injury , the loss of intracellular constituents is thus confined to the area of the blebs . Above all , the sealed-off blebs serve as a sink of potentially damaging Ca2 ? , thereby averting detrimental , Ca2 ? -triggered proteolysis and lipolysis within the cell proper . Results Plasmalemmal injury triggers blebbing . Human embryonic kidney HEK 293 cells responded to permeabilization with streptolysin O SLO � a bacterial pore-forming toxin � by sprouting multiple transient blebs Figure 1a Supplementary Movie 1 . Whereas only 1.8�0.6 % of the cells blebbed before the addition of SLO 440 cells in 16 independent experiments , 36.4�2.4 % of the same cell population blebbed after its application Figure 1b t-test Po0.01 . Contraction of the cortical actomyosin was a driving force in bleb formation Figure 1b only 1.4�0.8 % of the cells that had been pre-treated with blebbistatin � a selective inhibitor of myosin II ATPase26 � responded to SLO permeabilization by blebbing 125 cells in 4 experiments t-test Po0.01 . SLO-induced blebbing was the direct consequence of an injury-induced influx of Ca2 ? . Even after permeabilization , relatively few cells blebbed if [ Ca2 ? ] free in the extracellular milieu was below 100 nM Figure 1c experimental point [ Ca2 ? ] free ? 0 . When [ Ca2 ? ] free was increased to 1 mM , the percentage of blebbing cells increased significantly , attaining 0 20 40 60 a maximum at 5�10 mM Figure 1c for each experimental condition , a minimal number of 65 cells was recorded in four independent experiments Po0.01 for any experimental condi-tion compared with the experimental point [ Ca2 ? ] free ? 0 . A further increase in extracellular [ Ca2 ? ] free inhibited blebbing Figure 1c see also Figure 1b the bar �after SLO� represents data obtained at extracellular [ Ca2 ? ] ? 2.5mM . This inhibition is most likely the consequence of a sharp elevation in [ Ca2 ? ] i in permanently permeabilized cells9 that causes generalized damage to the phospholipid bilayer and cytoskeleton and leads to a depletion of intracellular ATP levels.2 Blebbing was a universal cellular response to plasmalem-mal injury all cell types we have tested so far blebbed in response to injury irrespective of the nature of the damaging agent Figure 2 Supplementary Movies 1 and 2 . Blebbing protects injured cells . To evaluate the role of blebbing during plasmalemmal injury , we simultaneously monitored bleb dynamics and the outcome of the damage in individual living cells . The fate of the perforated cells was visualized by monitoring the intracellular dynamics of annexin A1 Supplementary Figure S1 see also Babiychuk et al. , 2009 . The number of cells manifesting an irreversible translocation of annexin A1 lysed cells was scored in blebbing cells as well as in those that failed to bleb after exposure to SLO Figure 3a . Blebbing cells were more prone to recovery after an SLO attack than were non-blebbing ones , thereby indicating that blebbing contributed to cell survival in the wake of plasmalemmal injury Figure 3b . To afford causal evidence of the protective function of blebbing , we monitored the resistance to an SLO attack by cells whose blebbing was either inhibited or activated pharmacologically . Acrylamide and calyculin � a broad-spectrum phosphatase inhibitor � are known to activate blebbing.16 Indeed , blebbing was significantly amplified in non-permeabilized HEK 293 cells that had been treated with either acrilamide or calyculin Figure 3c . Staurosporine , a broad-spectrum kinase inhibitor , W7 , an inhibitor of myosin light chain kinase , and blebbistatin are known to inhibit blebbing.16,26 In non-permeabilized HEK 293 cells , an inhibition induced by either agent was obscured by a low level of background blebbing in control cells Figure 3c . SLO permeabilization resulted in significant amplification of the background blebbing Figures 1a and 3c , d , control , which revealed the inhibitory effects of staurosporine , W7 or blebbistatin Figure 3d . In SLO-permeabilized cells that had been pre-treated with either acrylamide or calyculin , blebbing was further amplified Figure 3c and d . The analysis of the intracellular dynamics of annexin A1 revealed acrylamide-and calyculin-pre-treated cells to be more likely to withstand an SLO attack than control cells Figure 3e Supplementary Figure S2 . On the other hand , cells that had been pre-treated with staurosporine , W7 or blebbistatin were more likely to be lysed than control cells Figure 3e Supplementary Figure S2 . U373 293 HEK T-cells Jurkat B-cells Raji Accordingly , the cytoplasmic components tracked with the cytoplasmic cyan-fluorescent protein , CFP were lost more rapidly from W7-pre-treated cells than from either the control cells or the calyculin-pre-treated ones Figure 3f . Hence , cells that had been pharmacologically manipulated to bleb exten-sively were more likely to withstand a toxin attack than were cells in which blebbing had been inhibited . Damaged regions are confined to blebs . The most compelling evidence for a protective role of blebbing during plasmalemmal injury is afforded by a direct observation of blebs in action . We simultaneously monitored blebbing , an elevation in [ Ca2 ? ] i membrane translocation of annexin A1 and the loss of cytoplasm CFP-leakage in SLO-treated HEK 293 cells Figure 4 . The cell marked �1� in Figure 4a did not respond to the SLO attack by blebbing Supplementary Movie 3 . After permeabilization this cell was confronted with a massive influx of Ca2 ? , which led to a global translocation of annexin A1 Figure 4a time after SLO addition ? 342 and 972 s and a complete loss of cytoplasm Figure 4a time after SLO addition ? 972 s . In contrast , cell �2� in Figure 4a responded to an SLO attack by extensive blebbing Figure 4a time after SLO addition ? 252 s Supplementary Movie 3 . As for cell �1� , the membrane permeability barrier in cells Non-blebbing 2 2 2 CFP Merge 5F Fluo In Figure 4b Supplementary Movie 4 , the SLO-induced elevation in Ca2 ? and leakage of CFP are documented for two blebs . An efficient permeabilization of the cell was accom-panied by a Ca2 ? elevation in both of the blebs but not in the rest of the cytoplasm Figure 4b time after SLO addition ? 765s . After permeabilization , the damaged plasma membrane of bleb �1� was efficiently repaired and excess of Ca2 ? was pumped out , thereby resulting in a back transloca-tion of annexin A1 Figure 4b times after SLO addition ? 801 and 846 s . In contrast , the repair mechanism in bleb �2� was inefficient the intrableb [ Ca2 ? ] remained elevated and annexin A1 remained associated with the plasma membrane Figure 4b . The loss of cytoplasm was exclusively confined to the irreversibly perforated bleb Figure 4b , arrows no leakage of cytoplasmic CFP occurred either from the repaired bleb or from the cell body . In some cells , only a transient intra-bleb translocation of annexin A1 occurred , and was followed by bleb retraction Supplementary Movie 5 . Not all blebbing cells see Figure 1a 36.4�2.4 % cells blebbing after SLO addition showed a localized intra-bleb translocation of annexin A1 17.5�2.1 % 369 cells tested in 12 independent experiments presumably , the most robust cells resealed their plasmalemmal lesions even before intra-bleb [ Ca2 ? ] elevated to the extent required for annexin A1 membrane translocation 10 mM , see Babiychuk et al. , 2009 . The protective role of blebbing during plasmalemmal injury was not restricted to the toxin attack . Supplementary Movie 6 documents a membrane injury followed by a plasmalemmal repair transient translocation of annexin A1-YFP localized within a bleb in a HEK 293 cell that had been treated with bacterial phospholipase C. Figure 4c details the protective action of blebbing in a mechanically damaged cell . A layer of U 373 cells , which form long cytoplasmic protrusions in culture , was scratched with the needle of a microsyringe above the area shown in the images . The mechanical force bent the cytoplasmic protrusion and locally injured the plasma mem-brane arrow . The damage was accompanied by a simulta-neous elevation in local [ Ca2 ? ] i , which manifested itself by a local translocation of annexin A1 Figure 4c time after scratch ? 12 s Supplementary Movie 7 . Within a few seconds , numerous blebs had sprouted around the cell body . However , the translocation of annexin A1 , which followed a substantial elevation in intrableb [ Ca2 ? ] , was observed only in the blebs of the damaged region . Bleb �1� remained permeabilized , whereas bleb �2� was efficiently repaired the intrableb [ Ca2 ? ] was lowered and annexin A1 back-translocated Figure 4c time after scratching ? 66 s . Fifteen minutes after scratching , annexin A1 had accumulated within the damaged region and was associated with the membranes of numerous small blebs Figure 4c time after scratching ? 900 s . These blebs were directly connected to the extracellular milieu the intrableb [ Ca2 ? ] remained high and the intrableb cytoplasm leaked out Figure 4c time after scratching ? 900 s , small arrows . However , neither a global elevation in [ Ca2 ? ] i nor a global loss of cytoplasm was observed . In the experiments described above , a selective loss of the cytoplasmic components from the damaged blebs was directly demonstrated by monitoring the leakage of CFP . The intrableb Ca2 ? elevation was indirectly assessed by monitoring the Ca2 ? -dependent translocation of annexin A1.9 To demonstrate the localized intra-bleb elevation in Ca2 ? directly , we used Fluo 5F � a Ca2 ? -sensitive fluorescent dye � which permits a monitoring of Ca2 ? fluxes in the high micromolar range . The elevation , observed in non-transfected HEK 293 cells , is documented in Figure 5 and in Supplemen-tary Movie 8 . These results also confirmed that the selective intra-bleb elevation in Ca2 ? was not a transfection artefact . It should be noted that Ca2 ? measurements with cytoplasmic fluorescent dyes reflect fairly accurately the events that occur during the initial stages of permeabilization however , they can not be applied for the evaluation of relatively long-term processes such as plasmalemmal repair . After an initial elevation , the Ca2 ? -induced fluorescent signal declines in repaired active Ca2 ? extrusion and in permanently permea-bilized cells loss of fluorescent dye alike.9 The rapid loss of fluorescent dye from perforated blebs was presumably responsible for a decreased incidence of Fluo 5F-positive blebs 8.8�1.7 % 356 cells analysed in seven independent experiments compared with the annexin A1-positive blebs 17.5�2.1 % . Taken together , these experiments demonstrate that blebbing protects damaged cells by isolating the damaged regions , thereby preventing a global loss of cytoplasm and an uncontrolled influx of Ca2 ? . Our observations also indicate that the damaged blebs are sealed off from the rest of the cytoplasm . Annexin A1 plugs damaged blebs . As it is inconceivable that even the narrow neck of a bleb can alone restrict for long the process of diffusion between the bleb and the cell body , we explored possible diffusion-blocking mechanisms . A close inspection of the blebs in recovering cells revealed a spectacular 180 333 684 693 720 801 accumulation of annexin A1 at the base of the neck region Figure 6a arrow Supplementary Movies 9 and 10 . This accumulation of annexin A1 was not a consequence of cell 120 80 CFP 60 Intracellular 40 CFP 100 70 cells 40 10 80 % 60 cells folding because it was not mirrored by a corresponding accumulation of cytoplasmic CFP Figure 6a . Among 64 cells that showed a localized intra-bleb translocation of annexin A1 , 18 cells 31.6�7 % 12 independent experiments showed a marked accretion of annexin A1 at the region of the bleb-to-cell contact 7.9�1.3-fold increase in fluorescence compared with the fluorescence within a cytoplasmic region of interest similar to that shown in Figure 6a . It should be noted that , owing to their relatively small size , some of these structures inevitably escape detection in our experimental settings , being localized outside the confocal plane even if the corresponding , much larger bleb is in focus . In the presence of Ca2 ? , annexin A1 aggregates and fuses biological membranes.25,27�29 It is , moreover , instrumental in the inward vesiculation in multivesicular endosomes � a process that is driven by a budding and fusion of the organelle-limiting membrane.30 Hence , massive , Ca2 ? -induced local accumulation of annexin A1 would cross-link the neck membranes of a bleb and efficiently block any communication between it and the rest of the cell . Annexin A1 might also trigger a sealing of the lipid bilayer within the bleb-to-cell contact region by recruiting intracellular vesicles according to the �classical� resealing pathway.1,2 We tested these postulates either by inactivating annexin A1 with a blocking antibody13 or by downregulating annexin A1 expression level with siRNA . In the first set of experiments , native HEK 293 cells expressing endogenous annexin A1 were permeabilized in the presence of the antibody , which penetrated the cells via the perforated plasma membrane.6 In these cells , the SLO-induced loss of cytoplasmic CFP , collectively recorded from the whole observation field , was significantly faster than in those that had been perforated in the absence of the antibody Figure 6b . A substitution of anti-annexin A1 antibody by anti-b-actin antibody clone AC-15 of the same isotype IgG1 failed to accelerate cell lysis in SLO-perforated cells Figure 6b . When assessed individually , it was found that cells had either completely lost their cytoplasm lysed cells or , after a partial loss of CFP , were able to repair the damaged plasma membrane and thus avert a further loss of cytoplasm Figure 6c . The percentage of lysed cells was significantly higher when the perforation occurred in the presence of the anti-annexin A1 antibody Figure 6c . In the second set of experiments , annexin A1-specific siRNA was stably expressed in HEK 293 cells , resulting in a sevenfold reduction of annexin A1 protein levels Supplementary Figure S3 . In these cells , SLO-induced lysis was significantly accelerated Figure 6d . Scrambled siRNA failed to decrease annexin A1 levels Supplementary Figure S3 and had no effect on cell lysis Figure 6d . These findings demonstrate that annexin A1 is directly involved in protecting cells against plasmalemmal injury . Discussion Formerly , the blebbing of injured cells was deemed to be a harbinger of death.31 Indeed , we have ourselves observed that blebbing of some injured cells forebodes their lysis . However , here we show that injured cells that failed to bleb were prone to dying , whereas those that manifested blebbing were more likely to recover . Moreover , a pharmacologically induced increase in blebbing led to a significant increase in the cell-survival rate . Hence , in injured cells , blebbing represents a cell�s attempt to escape death rather than a mechanism promoting it . Our findings have disclosed blebbing to play a hitherto unknown role in protecting the plasma membrane during injury Figure 7 1 An injury to the plasma membrane mechanical disruption , pores formed by cytotoxic proteins , lysis of the lipid bilayer disrupts the permeability barrier , thereby permitting an influx of Ca2 ? and an efflux of the intracellular constituents not shown . 2 An injury-induced influx of Ca2 ? triggers the phosphorylation of myosin II via Ca2 ? calmodulin-dependent myosin light chain kinase . It is conceivable that myosin-driven contraction of the cortical cytoskeleton instigates a localized increase in hydrostatic pressure within the surrounding cytoplasm the plasma membrane around the lesion herniates to form a bleb containing the damaged membrane . If the cell is able to repair the membrane lesion , the elevated intra-bleb [ Ca2 ? ] is pumped out and eventually the bleb retracts not shown . If resealing fails , intra-bleb [ Ca2 ? ] continues to rise. 3 Once [ Ca2 ? ] within the perforated bleb reaches 10 mM see Babiychuk et al.9 , intra-bleb annexin A1 binds to the plasma membrane , thereby creating an �annexin A1 vacuum� within the bleb . Following the concentration gradient , cytosolic annexin A1 streams from the cell body into the bleb . From the cytoplasmic side , an aperture of a slender neck of the bleb is seen as a hot-spot of inflowing Ca2 ? outside the opening the local Ca2 ? concentration decreases rapidly due to diffusion into the cytoplasm and due to a Ca2 ? sequestration by the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria . The locally elevated Ca2 ? drives annexin A1 binding to the plasma membrane in the vicinity or within of the bleb aperture . A Ca2 ? -induced formation of ceramide within the plasma membrane exposed to the Ca2 ? hot-spot might further increase the selectivity of annexin A1 binding.32 Thus concentrated , annexin A1 cross-links adjacent membranes of a slender neck of the bleb , thereby forming a plug . An efflux of cytosol is thus prevented and extracellular �invaders� remain trapped within the injured bleb . The proposed mechanism accords with the observation that blebbing is not directly involved in the repair of the plasma membrane , that is , in the direct elimination of plasmalemmal lesions.8 Blebbing can be regarded as a damage-control mechanism , which is triggered after initial attempts at plasmalemmal resealing have failed . Above all , an uncon-trolled intracellular Ca2 ? overload is responsible for the death of perforated cells.9�12 Repaired blebs are able to trap and evacuate elevated levels of Ca2 ? . However , if the membrane damage is too extensive to be repaired , the damaged regions are sacrificed to spare the rest of the cell the plugged , irreversibly permeabilized blebs might be discarded by the cell.5,31 We show that an injury to the plasma membrane causes bleb formation by triggering an influx of extracellular Ca2 ? . However , in non-perforated cells blebbing can also be induced by Ca2 ? -independent mechanisms via an activation of ROCK-dependent pathways.24 This phenomenon is routi-nely observed in cells exposed to toxic substances or at the onset of apoptosis.17,18,20 Apoptotic cells , in which the Ca2 ? homeostasis is usually compromised , 33 succumb more read-ily to plasmalemmal injury than do healthy cells.9�11 The ability of environmentally stressed or apoptotic cells to undergo spontaneous blebbing suggests that they might be able to anticipate their potential repair deficiency . The spontaneous protrusion of blebs , which often cover the whole cellular surface17�19 see also Supplementary Figure S2 , calyculin Supplementary Movie 11 , shields the cell body Figure 7 , step 4 an approaching toxin would first encounter the protruding membranes of the pre-existing blebs . A toxin-induced perforation of the blebs would result in an immediate confinement of the pores within the pre-existing traps . Hence , by forestalling the time-consuming step of targeted bleb formation Figure 7 , step 2 , random blebbing before membrane damage would facilitate a speedy recovery of the perforated cells , and thus stave off an attack by invading pathogens or blood complement . Cytotoxic T-cells and natural killer cells utilize a pore-forming protein , perforin , to eliminate virus-infected cells and tumours.34,35 During perforin-induced cell death , the integrity of the plasma membrane is restored by repair responses that protect the cells from necrosis and permit granzymes to trigger apoptosis.5 We assume that blebbing is intimately involved in protecting perforin-permeabilized cells from necrosis . In support of this hypothesis , Keefe et al.5 have observed a selective accumulation of small extracellular dyes within the blebs of perforin-permeabilized cells that were undergoing apoptosis , whereas in irreversibly permeabilized , necrotic cells , the dyes were distributed throughout the entire cytoplasm . In conclusion , our study identifies a novel defence strategy that is adopted by cells as a response to plasmalemmal injury . Deficiencies in the intrinsic membrane-protection mechan-isms may contribute to the pathogenesis of degenerative , infectious and immune diseases . Therefore , further experiments are required to establish whether blebbing is involved in protection against plasmalemmal injury in vivo . Materials and Methods Reagents .

Melanoma develop-ment is accomplished through the accumulation of genetic alterations in growth control pathways including oncogenic mutations or gene amplification . For example , constitutive activation of the Ras MAPkinase-signaling pathway is frequently observed in melanomas , as a consequence of activating mutations of the B-Raf and N-Ras genes.1�3 Melanoma progression is also accompanied by generation of autocrine and paracrine loops associated with the aberrant production and secretion of growth factors and chemokines that sustain growth , survival and invasion.4 In humans , melanoma is one of the most lethal cancers among young adults . Melanoma has a high capability of invasion and rapid metastasis to other organs . The prognosis of metastatic melanoma is extremely dismal , as the various treatments have not shown survival benefit.5 It appears thus necessary to develop approaches enabling the discovery of new molecular targets , candidates for specific biotherapy treatment of this disease . Thiazolidinediones TZDs regulate transcriptional activity of the nuclear receptor peroxysome proliferator activated receptor g PPARg and are currently used in type II diabetes treatment . More recently , TZD have been reported to inhibit proliferation and survival of numerous cancer cells.6 Furthermore , we have previously demonstrated that ciglitazone , which belongs to TZD family , inhibits growth and viability of melanoma cells without affecting normal melano-cyte growth.7 To further investigate the molecular events elicited by ciglitazone and to better understand the implication of TZD signaling in melanoma biology , we examined whether ciglitazone affects the production of autocrine and paracrine factors known to be implicated in melanoma malignancy . In this report , we demonstrate that ciglitazone inhibits the expression of C-X-C motif ligand 1 CXCL1 , a chemokine involved in melanoma growth , survival , angiogenesis and metastasis.8�11 Interestingly , ciglitazone treatment decreases CXCL1 level in various human melanoma cell lines but not in normal human melanocytes . We also show that treatment of melanoma cells with recombinant CXCL1 compensates for the loss of endogenous CXCL1 secretion induced by ciglitazone and abolishes the loss of viability of melanoma cells . Furthermore , CXCL1 inhibition by ciglitazone is mediated by the decrease in microphthalmia-associated transcription factor MITF expression . CXCL1 appears to be a new target gene of MITF , the master gene of melanocyte differentiation that was also involved in melanoma develop-ment.12�16 Finally , we show that a dramatic inhibition of melanoma xenograft development in mice in response to ciglitazone is associated with a decrease in MITF gene expression and in circulating CXCL1 level . Our results demonstrate for the first time that ciglitazone-induced apoptosis of melanoma involves an inhibition of a MITF CXCL1-signaling cascade . Results Effect of ciglitazone on CXCL1 expression and secretion . We first determined whether the biological effects of ciglitazone in melanoma cells were mediated by secreted factors . We confirmed that ciglitazone did not affect normal human melanocytes NHM viability Figure 1a . In contrast , the number of melanocytes was significantly reduced when incubated in the presence of conditioned medium from A375 melanoma cells exposed to ciglitazone compared to conditioned medium from Dimethyl sulfoxide DMSO -treated A375 cells Figure 1b . These results suggest that the inhibition of melanoma cell growth or survival elicited by ciglitazone was at least in part mediated by secreted factors . To substantiate this observation , we analyzed by quantita-tive-PCR , the expression of 19 transcripts encoding for proteins known to be secreted by melanoma Table 1 . Among them ciglitazone clearly repressed the expression of CXCL1 . Owing to the important role of the CXCL1 chemokine in melanoma progression , we decided to investigate its involvement in the effect of ciglitazone on melanoma cells . RT-QPCR analysis confirmed a dose-dependent down-regulation of CXCL1 expression in ciglitazone-treated A375 melanoma cells Figure 2a . Then , we demonstrated a decrease in CXCL1 cytoplasmic protein by immunofluores-cence Figure 2b . TNFa , an activator of NF-kB pathway , significantly increased the level of CXCL1 . CXCR2 labeling was not modulated in response to ciglitazone Figure 2b , lower part . CXCL1 amount in medium was evaluated by ELISA . TNFa increased CXCL1 level , whereas ciglitazone induced a dose-dependent reduction of CXCL1 in both basal and TNFa conditions Figure 2c . Western blot of the secreted matricel-lular SPARC protein was used as loading control . Relationship between CXCL1 downregulation and cell viability inhibition induced by ciglitazone . One could think that the inhibition of CXCL1 is the consequence of the decrease in cell viability induced by ciglitazone . However , reduction of CXCL1 was detectable after 2h and therefore could not result from the decrease in viability of cells that was observed after 12 h Figure 3a . In contrast , the slight decrease in CXCL1 level observed after 12 h to 48 h of staurosporine treatment appeared to be the consequence of cell death . Next , other TZD , pioglitazone and rosiglitazone had no significant effect on CXCL1 secretion Figure 3b . In contrast , troglitazone showed a dose-dependent decrease in CXCL1 level comparable to that observed with ciglitazone . Moreover , the decrease in CXCL1 level in response to ciglitazone treatment was still observable when PPARg expression was abrogated by siRNA silencing , indicating that ciglitazone acts independently of PPARg to repress CXCL1 expression Supplementary Figure S1 . Interestingly , no CXCL1 was detectable in NHM Figure 3c . However , treatment of melanocytes by TNFa induced an increase in the level of CXCL1 that was not modulated by ciglitazone . Finally , we tested ciglitazone on different tumor cell lines . SK-Mel-28 , WM793 and 1205 Lu melanoma cells had basal CXCL1 levels comparable to that found in A375 , whereas MeWo had very low CXCL1 level . In all melanoma cells , TNFa induced a significant increase in CXCL1 level and ciglitazone strongly decreased the chemokine level . In contrast to neuroblastoma cells SH-SY5Y , prostate tumor cells PC-3 presented a high CXCL1 basal level . As in melanoma cells , TNFa significantly increased the cytokine level in both cell lines , whereas ciglitazone strongly reduced the level of CXCL1 Figure 3d . The effects of ciglitazone on growth and survival in these cell lines were tested Figure 3e and Supplementary Figure S2 . Ciglitazone treatment decreased the cell number in all tumor cell lines tested so far . However , the most striking effect was observed in melanoma cell lines with a high basal CXCL1 level . Growth factors Cytokines Other melanoma-secreted proteins Effect of recombinant CXCL1 on the decrease in cell viability induced by ciglitazone . To determine whether CXCL1 inhibition had an important role in ciglitazone-induced loss of melanoma cell viability , we compensated the loss of endogenous CXCL1 by adding human recombinant CXCL1 rCXCL1 . As expected , ciglitazone 10 mM induced a loss of 65 % of cell viability Figure 4a . Addition of rCXCL1 prevented in a dose-dependent manner the loss of cell viability . Similarly , the reduction of cell viability induced by ciglitazone was reversed by TNFa Figure 4b . Interestingly , rCXCL1 did not prevent cell viability reduction mediated by two apoptosis inductors , TRAIL and staurospor-ine Figure 4c . The protective effect of rCXCL1 thus seems specific of the ciglitazone action . We have previously established that low concentrations of ciglitazone induced a G0 G1 cell cycle arrest of A375 melanoma cells . Our results demonstrated that rCXCL1 was able to reverse ciglitazone-induced cell cycle arrest Supplementary Figure S3 . We have also shown that high concentrations of ciglitazone induced melanoma cells apoptosis . We observed that 10 mM ciglitazone induced the disappearance of the zymogenic form of caspases 3 , 8 and 9 as well as a cleavage of poly ADP-ribose polymerase PARP . Consistently with the protective effect of rCXCL1 , cleavage of caspases and PARP evoked by 10 mM ciglitazone were not detected in the presence of rCXCL1 Figure 5a . These results were confirmed by caspase 3 , 8 and 9 activation assays Figure 5b . Interest-ingly , rCXCL1 was not able to prevent the activation of these three caspases induced by staurosporine . Furthermore , flow cytometry analysis showed that rCXCL1 blocked the accu-mulation of the cell in sub-G1 Supplementary Figure S3 and prevented the increase in annexin-V labeling Figure 5c , both induced by ciglitazone . In conclusion , CXCL1 protects melanoma cells from apoptosis induced by ciglitazone . Our observations prompted us to check whether CXCL1 inhibition was sufficient to reduce melanoma cell viability . Transfection of A375 cells with increasing concentrations of si-CXCL1 induced a strong and dose-dependent reduction of the CXCL1 protein level Figure 6a . Next , we observed that A375 cells transfected with si-CXCL1 showed a dose-dependent reduction of cell viability that was impaired by rCXCL1 Figure 6b . Then , we observed a dose-dependent reduction of A375 cell viability in the presence of anti-CXCL1 neutralizing antibodies Figure 6c . We next showed that CXCL1 silencing induced the activation of caspases 9 , 8 and 3 Figure 6d as well as an increase in annexin-V labeling Figure 6e . Taken together , these results indicate that the inhibition of CXCL1 production is sufficient to induce apoptosis in melanoma cells . In the same way , inhibition of CXCR2 signaling by neutralizing antibody or pharmacological inhibitor SB225002 mimics the effects of ciglitazone on growth inhibition Supplementary Figure S4 . Involvement of MITF in the regulation of CXCL1 expression by ciglitazone . To further investigate the mechanism responsible for ciglitazone-induced CXCL1 downregulation , we focused our attention on MITF that was recently reported to be regulated by some PPARg agonists.17,18 Ciglitazone induced a dose-dependent reduction of MITF expression in both A375 and SK-Mel-28 melanoma cells Figure 7a . We demonstrated that MITF inhibition by ciglitazone was not due to its cleavage during apoptosis because the MITF decrease was observed earlier than PARP cleavage . To confirm this result we showed that the pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK prevented melanoma cell death induced by ciglitazone treatment Supplementary Figure S5 by preventing apoptosis induction monitored by PARP processing Figure 7a , right panel . However , MITF inhibition evoked by ciglitazone was still observed in the presence of Z-VAD-FMK . Finally , using RT-QPCR , we also found a dose-dependent decrease of MITF expression confirming that ciglitazone inhibited MITF expression at the transcriptional level Figure 7b . We next checked whether MITF might control CXCL1 expression . MITF silencing by specific si-RNA induced a strong reduction of the MITF transcript and a concomitant reduction of CXCL1 gene expression Figure 7c . Melanoma cells transfected with a vector encoding for wild-type MITF revealed an increased in CXCL1 labeling by immunofluores-cence Figure 7d . Consistently , forskolin or forskolin IBMX that increased endogenous MITF level showed a significant increase in CXCL1 Figure 7e . To determine whether MITF controlled the CXCL1 promoter activity , we performed luciferase assays on melanoma cells using either tyrosinase or CXCL1 promoter upstream the luciferase coding sequence . Transfection with a dominant negative form of MITF DN MITF led to a decrease in both tyrosinase and CXCL1 promoter activity . Conversely , trans-fection with the wild-type form of MITF MITF led to an upregulation of tyrosinase and CXCL1 promoter activity Figure 7f . Then , to verify the binding of MITF to the CXCL1 promoter in intact cells , we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation ChIP assays . Direct PCR amplification with specific primers spanning the CXCL1 promoter between 410 and ? 77 , on total DNA extract or after immunoprecipitation with antibody to polymerase II as a positive control amplified a 500-bp fragment Figure 7g . After immunoprecipitation with anti-MITF , we amplified a band at 500 bp corresponding to the CXCL1 promoter . The intensity of this band was clearly decreased in extracts from cells exposed to ciglitazone , but not in extracts from cells exposed to forskolin Fsk . Conversely , using specific GAPDH promoter primers , we amplified 160-bp fragment corresponding to the GAPDH promoter in both the total extract and the anti-Pol II precipitates , but not in the anti-MITF precipitates . These results show that MITF binds to the CXCL1 promoter in intact cells and that this interaction is abolished by ciglitazone treatment . Effect of ciglitazone on circulating CXCL1 and melanoma tumor xenografts development in mice . Then , to determine the effect of ciglitazone on circulating CXCL1 and on tumor development in vivo , human A375 melanoma cells were injected subcutaneously in athymic nude mice . Nineteen days post injection , mice were treated with vehicle or ciglitazone 50mg kg day for 11 days . Tumors from untreated mice dramatically grew throughout the time course of the study Figure 8a . In contrast , treatment of mice with ciglitazone markedly attenuated the capacity of cells to develop visible tumors . Indeed , 3 out of 6 ciglitazone-treated mice did not have a measurable tumor at the end of the treatment , and tumors of other mice were significantly smaller compared with untreated control mice . After killing mice , RT-QPCR were performed on RNA extracted from tumors . Interestingly , MITF and CXCL1 gene expression were significantly lower in tumors of ciglitazone-treated mice Figure 8b . Further , no significant CXCL1 level was detected in ciglitazone-treated mice in comparison with vehicle-treated mice Figure 8c . When we expressed the quantity of serum CXCL1 as a function of tumor volume , we observed a 3.5-fold significant reduction in the level of circulating CXCL1 in ciglitazone-treated mice . Therefore , the decrease in CXCL1 serum level observed in ciglitazone-treated mice was not due to a decrease in tumor volume , but was likely a consequence of CXCL1 inhibition induced by ciglitazone . Finally , to unequivocally demonstrate the impor-tance of CXCL1 downregulation in the in vivo effects of ciglitazone , we evaluated the effects of rCXCL1 peritumoral injections 200 ng tumor day for 14 days on the development of tumors in mice treated or not with ciglitazone . As expected , treatment of mice with ciglitazone markedly impaired tumor development Figure 8d . However , rCXCL1 treatment dramatically favored tumor development and abrogated anti-tumoral effects of ciglitazone . Injection of human recom-binant CXCL1 therefore compensates for the decrease in endogenous CXCL1 level mediated by ciglitazone treatment and promotes tumor growth . Because metastatic melanoma are resistant to all currently used treatments , the discovery of new therapeutic drugs is a very important challenge . We and others have previously shown that ciglitazone , a molecule of the TZD family , is able to induce apoptosis independently of PPARg activation and to inhibit proliferation of melanoma cells.7,19�21 In this report , we have investigated the molecular mechanism by which ciglitazone exerts its anti-melanoma activity . Our results showed that conditioned media from ciglita-zone-treated melanoma cells inhibit normal human melano-cyte growth indicating that the effects of ciglitazone on melanoma cells are mediated by secreted factors . RT-QPCR screening demonstrating an inhibition of CXCL1 chemokine upon ciglitazone treatment prompted us to focus our attention on this cytokine . CXCL1 also named melanoma growth stimulating activity or growth-regulated oncogene a GROa belongs to the CXC family . CXCL1 is essential for the establishment and the maintenance of the tumoral potential of melanoma.22,23 CXCL1 bind with high affinity to CXCR2 . Overexpression of CXCL1 in INK4a ARF mice favors melanoma development 24 and promotes malignant growth of murine squamous cell carcinoma by a CXCR2-dependent pathway.25 Blocking antibodies to either CXCL1 or CXCR2 inhibit melanoma cell growth showing the key role of the CXCL1 CXCR2-signalingpathwayinmelanomadevelopment.26,27 In addition to its autocrine role , CXCL1 has been shown to have an important paracrine role by regulating angiogenesis during tumor development including melanoma.28,29 First , we show that ciglitazone negatively regulates mRNA and protein CXCL1 levels . This inhibition is accompanied by a reduction of CXCL1 in the medium . The inhibition of CXCL1 in response to ciglitazone precedes the decrease in cell viability , indicating that the decrease in CXCL1 expression induced by ciglitazone is not a consequence of cell death . A similar decrease in CXCL1 is also observed in response to troglitazone whereas rosiglitazone and pioglitazone have no significant effect on CXCL1 secretion . This result is in agreement with our previous report showing that both rosiglitazone and pioglitazone have only marginal PPARg-dependent effect on viability of melanoma cells.7 Consistent with this finding , PPARg silencing by siRNA does not abrogate the effects of ciglitazone on CXCL1 expression , indicating that the regulation of CXCL1 is PPARg independent . In normal human melanocytes , there is not basal CXCL1 production . Treatment of normal human melanocytes with TNFa stimulation increases CXCL1 secretion that is not affected by ciglitazone . Conversely , melanoma cells generally have a constitutive basal CXCL1 expression mainly due to the NF-kB pathway constitutive activation.22 Independently of the mutational status , melanoma development stage or CXCL1 basal level , we found that ciglitazone inhibits CXCL1 produc-tion in all tested melanoma cell lines . Moreover , there is a positive correlation between the level of basal CXCL1 and the decrease in cell viability mediated by ciglitazone , suggesting that melanoma cells producing CXCL1 are addict to these cytokines . In the same way , in other cancer cell lines such as prostate carcinoma or neuroblastoma , ciglitazone also decreases CXCL1 level and cell viability . These results support the idea that inhibition of CXCL1 cytokine could have a general role in the anti-tumoral effects of ciglitazone . It has been proposed that some PPARg agonists lead to inhibition of NF-kB activation , 30�32 but in our system , the inhibition of CXCL1 by ciglitazone is not mediated by the downregulation of NF-kB activity data not shown . Interest-ingly , a recent paper showed that ciglitazone led to a decrease in MITF expression17 and in silico analysis of the CXCL1 promoter showed four potential E boxes that match with the consensus binding site for MITF transcription factor data not shown , thereby suggesting the possible involvement of MITF in the control of CXCL1 expression . These two observations prompted us to investigate the role of MITF in the regulation of CXCL1 by ciglitazone . First , ChIP experiments and luciferase assays show that MITF binds to and regulates the CXCL1 promoter . MITF silencing decreases CXCL1 messengers and inhibits CXCL1 protein secretion . Additional studies suggest that MITF interacts with the CXCL1 promoter through a responsive element CAGGTG at �375 . Furthermore , we have previously found that MITF is cleaved in response to the apoptosis inductor , TRAIL.33 MITF diminution that we observed in response to ciglitazone is not due to a protein cleavage by caspases because MITF decrease is seen before apoptosis induction and is also seen on mRNA level and in the presence of pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK . These interesting results highlight a new specific pathway mediated by ciglitazone in melanoma cells . We have demonstrated that the negative regulation of MITF by ciglitazone is a PPARg-independent event . However , the precise mechanism responsible for this negative regulation of MITF is not known . One possible mechanism might involve downregulation of the Wnt b-catenin pathway because this pathway is inhibited by some PPARg agonists and might mediate the inhibition of MITF expression.17,18 Thus , con-sidering all our results we show for the first time that the control of MITF expression by ciglitazone is involved in the inhibition of CXCL1 expression and secretion . This new signaling pathway involves MITF in the regulation of CXCL1 and strengthens the importance of this transcription factor in melanoma tumorigenicity . We have previously shown that ciglitazone has cytostatic and cytotoxic effects.7 We found that both cell cycle arrest and apoptosis evoked by ciglitazone are reversed by addition of rCXCL1 or TNFa . These data suggest that ciglitazone effects on cell viability are mediated mainly by a decrease in CXCL1 expression and secretion . In addition , rCXCL1 does not protect cells from apoptosis induced by TRAIL and staurosporine , suggesting a potential specificity of rCXCL1 on ciglitazone effects . The depletion of CXCL1 with siRNA is sufficient to mimic the biological effects of ciglitazone on A375 cells . Consequently , these results reinforce the hypothesis that inhibition of CXCL1 synthesis by ciglitazone is implied in the biological effects of this TZD . A second approach by CXCL1-neutralizing antibodies confirmed these results . Therefore , the reduction of secreted form of CXCL1 is involved in ciglitazone biological effects . Finally , we have evaluated the correlation between poten-tial anti-melanoma activity of ciglitazone and CXCL1 secretion in a mouse model of melanoma xenografts . We have previously demonstrated that ciglitazone prevents tumor growth development.7 Importantly , our present results show that the short-term administration of ciglitazone not only prevents tumor formation but also reduces the volume of already established melanoma tumors . In addition , ciglitazone decreases MITF and CXCL1 mRNA level in tumor xenograft , reinforcing the hypothesis that in vivo , MITF is also involved in the control of CXCL1 mediated by ciglitazone . In parallel , we observe a drastic reduction of serum CXCL1 level in mice . This decrease is not due to the reduction of tumor growth , because when we expressed the quantity of CXCL1 as a function of tumor size , we still found a reduction of circulating CXCL1 in ciglitazone-treated mice . Moreover , injection of CXCL1 in ciglitazone-treated mice compensates for the loss of endogenous CXCL1 , impairing the effects of ciglitazone and preventing the decrease in tumor volume . From these observations , we can propose that the decrease in CXCL1 secretion mediated by ciglitazone might be responsible for the antineoplastic effects of this TZD in vivo . In summary , we demonstrate for the first time that ciglitazone inhibits tumor growth through a negative regulation of the MITF CXCL1 CXCR2 axis-signaling pathway . This demonstration brings new and additional clues to the mechanism of ciglitazone-induced melanoma cell death . Finally , taking into account the drastic effect of ciglitazone on melanoma cell growth , survival and anti-melanoma xenograft development , it might be worth evaluating ciglita-zone treatment in patients with metastatic melanoma . Our reports also highlight the pivotal role of tumor cell-produced CXCL1 in melanoma cell proliferation and support the idea that CXCL1 might be used as a new progression marker in the follow-up of the metastatic melanomas . Because the over-expression of CXCL1 and the CXCL1 regulation by ciglitazone are not specific to the melanomas , our study , besides its interest in melanoma pathology , contributes to better under-stand the general anti-cancer effects of ciglitazone .

It was subsequently shown that these enzymes catalyze the conjugation of glutathione GSH to a variety of electrophilic compounds , thus establishing the now widely accepted role of GSTs as cell housekeepers involved in the detoxification of endogenous as well as exogenous substances.1�3 Advances in the molecular biology of the GSTs over the past several years have revealed a broader role for these enzymes . Indeed , GSTs have been found to be involved in the biosynthesis and metabolism of prostaglandins , 4 steroids , 5 and leukotrienes 6 in the management of toxic products of lipid oxidation and S-glutathiolated proteins generated by oxidative stress 7�9 and in the acquisition of resistance to chemotherapeutic agents.10�12 More recently , several GST isoenzymes have been shown to modulate cell signaling pathways that control cell proliferation and cell death apoptosis .13�17 Because of their cytoprotective role and their involvement in the development of resistance to anti-cancer agents , GSTs have become attractive drug targets . This review focuses on the inhibition of GSTP1-1 , the most prevalent and ubiquitous non-hepatic isoenzyme , as a potential therapeutic approach for the treatment of cancer . www.nature.com cdd E Laborde* , 1 Cytosolic GSTs The GSTs encompass three major families of proteins 1 cytosolic , 2 mitochondrial , and 3 microsomal also referred to as membrane-associated proteins in eicosanoid and glutathione MAPEG , of which the cytosolic GSTs constitute the largest family.18 On the basis of amino acid sequence similarities , substrate specificity , and immunological cross-reactivity , seven classes of cytosolic GSTs have been identified in mammals.19�21 These classes are designated by the names of the Greek letters a alpha , m mu , p pi , s sigma , y theta , o omega , and z zeta , and abbreviated in Roman capitals A , M , P , S , T , O , and Z.22,23 Most GST classes show a high degree of polymorphism and include several subunits . Each subunit ca . 199�244 amino acids in length , 22�29 kDa contains a catalytically independent active site that consists of a GSH-binding site �G-site� in the amino-terminal domain and a site that binds the hydrophobic substrate �H-site� in the carboxy-terminal domain . More than a dozen cytosolic GST subunits have been identified in humans . As the functional enzymes are dimeric , and those of the a and m classes , in addition to homodimers , can also form heterodimers , the number of isoenzymes that can be generated from these subunits is significantly larger Table 1 . The isoenzymes are named according to their class and subunit composition , with each subunit designated by an Arabic numeral e.g. , GSTA1-2 denotes the enzyme composed of subunits 1 and 2 of the a class .23 Table 1 Classes of mammalian cytosolic GSTs Expression of the different classes of GSTs varies among tissues and with developmental stage . For example , a-class GSTs are predominantly expressed in liver , testis , and kidney , and their expression levels are similar in both adult and fetal tissues . In contrast , GSTp GSTP1-1 , originally isolated from placenta , is found mainly in brain , lung , and heart its expression in liver decreases during embryonic development , becoming very low in adult tissue.24�26 GSTP1-1 and Cancer Given their cytoprotective role as phase II enzymes involved in the deactivation of harmful electrophilic compounds , much of the earlier work on GSTs was focused on the identification of endogenous as well as exogenous substrates . Among the latter , special attention was given to carcinogens , pesticides , and other environmental pollutants . This effort was followed by studies of the expression level of specific isoenzymes in a variety of cancer cell lines , as this level was deemed to be a potential indicator of cancer development and resistance to anticancer drugs . The majority of human tumor cell lines , including those selected in vitro for resistance to chemotherapeutic agents , overexpress GSTP1-1.27,28 In fact , GSTP1-1 was found to be the predominant isoenzyme up to 2.7 % of the total cytosolic protein in all but 2 of 60 tumor cell lines used in the Drug Screening Program of the National Cancer Institute NCI . Significant quantitative correlations among enzymatic activity , total enzyme protein , and mRNA were shown , particularly in those cell lines selected for resistance to alkylating agents such as melphalan , chlorambucil , cyclophosphamide , BCNU N , N�-bis 2-chloroethyl -N-nitrosourea , and cisplatin . Over-expression of GST a and m isoenzymes was also observed , but comparable correlations were much less apparent.29 A variety of human cancers , including of breast , colon , kidney , lung , and ovarian , usually express high levels of GSTP1-1 compared with the surrounding tissues . Conse-quently , GSTP1-1 expression has been considered to be a marker for cancer development.30,31 High expression levels have been associated not only with disease progres-sion but also with drug resistance in patients undergoing chemotherapy . Many anticancer drugs have been described as being substrates of multiple GSTs . However , and in spite of the alleged broad substrate specificity of the GSTs , specific isoenzymes have shown preferential substrate specificity . For example , GSTT1-1 has the highest activity toward BCNU , which is significant as GSTT1-1 is expressed in the brain , a common target for BCNU treatment.32 Similarly , a-class isoenzymes are very effective at catalyzing the conjugation of GSH to alkylating agents such as chlorambucil.33,34 In contrast , GSTP1-1 has a relatively weak affinity for the majority of anticancer drugs , even though its increased expression has been correlated with the development of the multidrug-resistant phenotype . This apparent discrepancy may be explained in terms of the influence of GSTP1-1 on signaling pathways that affect cell survival . GSTp GSTP1-1 and Cell Signaling In addition to their GSH-conjugating activity , GSTs have been recognized for their ability to bind structurally diverse nonsubstrate ligands such as steroids , heme and bilirubin . More recently , isoenzymes from several GST classes have been shown to associate with members of the mitogen-activated protein kinase MAPK pathways involved in cell survival and death signaling . In this non-enzymatic role , GSTs function to sequester the kinase in a complex , thus preventing it from acting on downstream targets . The result of this action is a regulation of pathways that control cell proliferation and apoptotic cell death . GSTp was among the first isoenzymes found to inhibit c-Jun N-terminal kinase JNK through direct protein�protein inter-action.13 JNK is a MAP kinase involved in stress response , apoptosis , inflammation , and cellular differentiation and proliferation . Ultraviolet UV radiation , protein synthesis inhibitors , and a variety of stress stimuli can activate JNK that , in turn , phosphorylates c-Jun , a component of the activator protein-1 AP-1 transcription factor . This activation leads to induction of AP-1-dependent target genes involved in cell proliferation and cell death.35 Studies of low basal JNK activity in normally growing , non-stressed 3T3-4A mouse embryonic fibroblasts led to the identification of GSTp as a c-Jun�JNK complex-associated protein that selectively inhibited the phosphorylation of c-Jun by JNK . Isoenzymes of the a and m classes were also shown to associate with the c-Jun�JNK complex in vitro , but showed weaker JNK inhibitory activity . UV irradiation or treatment of the cells with hydrogen peroxide H2O2 caused an increase in JNK activity and the appearance of a high-molecular-weight ca . 97 kDa oligomeric form of GSTp , showing that GSTp inhibition of JNK is due primarily to their association , and that this association is disrupted under conditions that induce oligomerization of GSTp Figure 1 .13 Treatment of GSTp with H2O2 is known to inactivate the enzyme by promoting the formation of intra-and or inter-subunit disulfide bonds involving Cys-47 and Cys-101.36 The above findings , combined with the involvement of JNK in apoptosis and the observation that GSTp i.e. , GSTP1-1 is often highly expressed in tumor tissues , suggested a possible role of this isoenzyme in apoptosis resistance during anti-cancer therapy . To test this hypothesis , apoptosis was induced in a neoplastic T-cell line Jurkat by treatment with H2O2 or etoposide , and changes in GSTP1-1 levels were followed by western blotting . Apoptosis was observed after treatment of the cells with H2O2 , and it was paralleled by the appearance of a dimeric form ca. 46 kDa of GSTp and the intensification of its monomeric form ca. 21.5 kDa . These findings suggest GSTP1-1 GSTP1-1 a partial inactivation of GSTP1-1 by dimerization involving disulfide bond formation between Cys-47 from two different subunits , and also by intrasubunit disulfide bond formation between Cys-47 and Cys-101 . This inactivation was asso-ciated with an increased Km GSH and a decreased specific activity toward 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene CDNB .37 The initial studies of JNK activity in non-stressed and stressed 3T3-4A mouse fibroblasts led to the conclusion that it was the monomeric form of GSTp that inhibited JNK . Subsequent molecular dynamic calculations on the three-dimensional structure of GSTp , free and bound to an inhibitor that blocks its ability to inhibit JNK-jun activation , identified four putative domains involved in the interaction between GSTp and the c-Jun�JNK complex . The potential interaction site implicated in this analysis was found to be distal to the GST subunit dimerization domain involving Cys-47 and Cys-101 , suggesting that JNK may actually interact in vivo with homodimeric GSTP1-1.38 This hypothesis would seem to be supported by a recent study showing the dissociation constant of homodimeric GSTP1-1 to be in the subnanomolar range Kd o 1 nM , making it unlikely that the monomeric form would exist in any significant amount at the concentrations commonly used for assay measurement.39 The interaction between GSTp and JNK has also been established in vivo . Compared with wild-type mice GSTP1 P2 ? ? , a significant increase in constitutive JNK activity was found in the liver and lung of transgenic mice in which both the GSTP1 and GSTP2 genes were deleted GSTP1 P2 . The increase in JNK activity was accompanied by a significant increase eightfold in AP-1 DNA-binding activity . This study not only shows the role of GSTp as a direct inhibitor of JNK in vivo , but also its role in regulating the constitutive expression of specific downstream molecular targets of the JNK signaling pathway.40 GSTP1-1 has also been reported to associate with TNF receptor-associated factor 2 TRAF2 , a member of the TNF receptor-associated factor protein family . Overexpression of GSTP1-1 was found to inhibit TRAF2-induced activation of both JNK and p38-MAPK . GSTP1-1 also attenuated TRAF2-enhanced autophosphorylation of apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 ASK1 and inhibited TRAF2�ASK1-induced apop-tosis by suppressing the interaction of TRAF2 and ASK1.41 Most anticancer agents induce cell death through activation of the MAPK pathways , in particular those involving JNK and p38-MAPK . The role of GSTP1-1 as an endogenous inhibitor of JNK activation has direct relevance to the GSTP1-1-overexpressing phenotypes of many drug-resistant tumors . Indeed , elevated expression of GSTP1-1 during drug treat-ment can alter the balance of regulation of signaling pathways that influence cell proliferation and apoptosis , thereby con-ferring on tumor cells the ability to escape death.42 This process may provide an explanation for the numerous examples of drug resistance that link GSTP1-1 overexpres-sion with agents that are either poor substrates for this enzyme or not substrates at all . GSTP1-1 as a Therapeutic Target Because of its high expression in different tumors and its dual role as an enzyme involved in the deactivation of anticancer agents and as an inhibitor of signaling pathways leading to apoptosis , GSTP1-1 has emerged as a promising cancer therapeutic target . Many compounds have been described in the literature as being GSTP1-1 inhibitors , including GSH analogs , GSH conjugates , small organic molecules , and natural products.43�46 Their potency and degree of specificity toward this particular isoenzyme , however , vary considerably . A summary of the most relevant inhibitors is given in the following sections . Modification of the GSH backbone has been one of the successful strategies used in the design of GST inhibitors . This approach takes advantage of the inherent affinity of GSH for the GSTs and aims at building specificity by exploiting subtle structural differences among the isoenzymes.47,48 The highly conserved and selective G-site in GSTs , however , has made it difficult to achieve isoenzyme specificity without concomitant loss of binding affinity . The g-glutamyl residue of GSH , on the other hand , has proven to be absolutely critical for binding , whereas changes in the glycine and cysteine residues are tolerated , provided they maintain the appropriate balance of charge and hydrophilicity.49 A systematic evaluation of GSH analogs containing substituents at both the glycine a-carbon and the cysteine thiol group identified the tripeptide TLK117 g-glutamyl-S-benzyl cysteinyl-R -- phenylglycine as a potent and selec-tive inhibitor of GSTP1-1 Ki ? 0.4 mM . The binding affinity of TLK117 for the G-site of GSTP1-1 is greater than that of GSH itself , and its selectivity for GSTP1-1 is over 50-fold larger compared with isoenzymes of the a and m classes.50,51 Although the presence of both carboxylic acid groups is vital for enzyme inhibition , cellular uptake experiments showed that TLK117 did not enter the cells to any significant extent . To circumvent this problem , the carboxylic acid groups were esterified to give TLK199 , the diethyl ester prodrug of TLK117 Figure 2 . Similar to what has been observed with GSH diethyl ester , 52 TLK199 is taken up by cells and rapidly hydrolyzed to the phenylglycine monoethyl ester , whose intracellular concentration rises to levels that are significantly higher than those found after treatment of the cells with the monoester itself . High levels of the monoester , in turn , provide the cells with a means of producing TLK117 over a period of time.53 Given the high levels of expression of GSTP1-1 in neoplastic cells and its putative involvement in the deactiva-tion of chemotherapeutic agents , combinations of TLK199 with several of these agents were tested in cancer cell lines overexpressing GSTP1-1 to determine whether TLK199 would act as a chemosensitizer . TLK199 potentiated chlor-ambucil toxicity by ca . twofold in HT4-1 cells a subclone of the HT-29 human colon adenocarcinoma cell line made sensitive to ethacrynic acid , but the effect was less pronounced in a SKOV-3 human ovarian carcinoma cell line . TLK199 produced a slight increase in sensitivity to adriamycin in both cell lines , but had no effect on the sensitivity to mitomycin C.53 The potentiating effects of TLK199 observed in tumor cells were deemed not large enough to pursue in a clinical setting , particularly in the absence of toxicological information for different combination regimens . Instead , its effect on the sensitization of normal cells to cytotoxics , especially in the case of bone marrow , which is often the site of dose-limiting toxicity , was examined . TLK199 was shown to act as a small-molecule myelopro-liferative agent . It increased circulating white blood cells in normal mice and accelerated neutrophil recovery in rats and mice after 5-fluorouracil 5-FU -induced neutropenia . It also stimulated bone marrow progenitor colony-forming unit-granulocyte , monocyte CFU-GM proliferation in normal mice , an effect that required GSTp , as mice with a GSTp-null genotype GSTp did not respond to TLK199.14,54 These activities may be explained in terms of the ability of TLK199 i.e. , TLK117 to disrupt the interaction between GSTP1-1 and JNK and , as a result , modulate kinase pathways that affect cell proliferation and differentiation . Treatment of cells with TLK199 efficiently decreased GSTP1-1-mediated inhibition of JNK and led to a twofold increase in basal JNK activity in non-stressed cells.13 A human promyelocytic leukemia cell line HL-60 made resistant to TLK199 by chronic exposure to the drug showed elevated activities of JNK1 and extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 ERK1 ERK2 , which allowed these cells to proliferate under stress conditions that induced apoptosis in wild-type cells.14 These and other studies suggest that the myeloproliferative effects observed with TLK199 are dependent upon both GSTP1-1 expression and JNK activity , and that disruption of the GSTP1-1 JNK interaction by treatment with TLK199 results in normal bone marrow progenitor cell proliferation through a pathway other than those affected by standard cytokines . TLK199 ezatiostat hydrochloride Telintra , Patheon , Inc. , Mississauga , Ontario , Canada is currently being tested for the treatment of myelodysplastic syndrome MDS , a bone marrow neoplastic disease characterized by an ineffective production or dyspla-sia of myeloid blood cells and a risk of transformation into acute myeloid leukemia AML .55,56 GSTP1-1 is polymorphic . In humans , the GSTP1 gene has been mapped to chromosome 11q13 , and four allelic variants have been described GSTP1*A wild-type Ile 105 , Ala 114 , GSTP1*B Val 105 , Ala 114 , GSTP1*C Val 105 , Val 114 , and GSTP1*D Ile 105 , Val 114 .57�59 These allelic variants have been associated with different susceptibility and clinical outcomes in several diseases , including cancer . Recently , the effects of inducible expression of wild-type GSTP1*A and mutant GSTP1*C haplotypes on cell proliferation and apop-tosis in NIH-3T3 fibroblasts were examined . GSTP1-1 protected cells from apoptosis induced by treatment with H2O2 however , no differences between these two haplotypes could be observed using measurements of apoptosis.60 TLK117 was designed for efficient inhibition of the most abundant allelic variant , GSTP1*A , but it also competitively inhibits GSTP1*B with similar potency.61 Its activity against the other two allelic variants has not been determined . Several additional modifications of the GSH peptide back-bone have been explored with varying degrees of success . One approach focused on replacing the g-Glu-Cys amide linkage by a carbamate group to increase the metabolic stability toward g-glutamyltranspeptidase g-GT or GGT , an enzyme involved in the degradation of GSH . The carbamate analog of TLK117 , UrPhg , was identified as a g-GT-stable , potent and selective GSTP1-1 inhibitor Ki ? 3 , 16 , and 29 mM versus GSTP1-1 , GSTM1-1 , and GSTA1-1 . To improve cellular uptake , the diethyl ester of UrPhg UrPhg-Et2 was prepared Figure 2 . Treatment of a rat mammary adenocarcinoma cell line MTLn3 with UrPhg-Et2 induced GSTP1-1 oligomerization , as evidenced by the appearance of high-molecular-weight X92 kDa bands on a western blot . Concurrently with this oligomerization , a transient increase in both JNK and c-jun phosphorylation was also observed.62,63 The incorporation of the carbamate linkage together with the replacement of the cysteine residue by serine or aspartic acid , however , provided compounds devoid of GSTP1-1 inhibitory activity . The lack of activity has been attributed to a combination of conformational and electronic effects resulting from these replacements.64 A different approach consisted of replacing the cysteinyl CH2SH group of GSH with a phosphonate ester . This modification resulted in analogs that inhibited human GSTM1-1 , GSTA1-1 , and GSTP1-1 IC50 ? 4.7 , 15 , and 15 mM , respectively , for the di-n-butylphosphonate ester and were also stable against g-GT . The SAR of these compounds toward GSTP1-1 showed increased inhibitory potency with increased lipophilicity of the phosphono ester group n-Bu 4 i-Pr 4 Et . Cellular uptake experiment using HT29 colon cancer and EPG85-257P gastric cancer cells indicated that the dicarboxylic acids did not enter the cells . Esterification of the glycine carboxylic group , however , was enough to facilitate cellular uptake , in which the monoester was converted into the more active free acid.65,66 The effect of these inhibitors on JNK activation or cell viability remains largely unknown . GSH Conjugates Perhaps the most explored strategy for the development of GST inhibitors has been the conjugation of GSH , through its thiol group , to a variety of structural moieties . The rationale for this strategy rests on the observation that GSTs are subject to product inhibition.67 Among the GSH conjugates that have been prepared and studied in cells are those involving anthracyclines . A conjugate of GSH and doxorubicin DXR through glutaral-dehyde GSH-DXR was shown to have potent cytotoxicity against and to induce apoptosis in DXR-sensitive AH66P and DXR-resistant AH66DR rat hepatoma cell lines . The GSH-DXR conjugate appeared to be a non-competitive inhibitor of GSTP1-1 its cytotoxicity was markedly increased when the cells were co-treated with tributyltin acetate , an inhibitor of GSTP1-1 . Conversely , enhancement of GSTP1-1 expression in human hepatoblastoma HepG2 cells caused a decrease in GSH-DXR-induced activation of caspase-3 . Subsequent studies showed that binding of GSH-DXR to GSTP1-1 not only inhibited its enzymatic activity but also resulted in activation of JNK , although without significant dissociation of the JNK GSTP1-1 complex.68�70 A series of GSH conjugates intended to increase both the binding affinity and GST isoenzyme specificity consists of two molecules of GSH conjugated to a linker moiety . These bivalent inhibitors were designed so that each GSH unit would simultaneously interact with the active site of each of the two GST monomeric units . Several bis-glutathionyl nitrophenyl derivatives bearing linkers of different flexibility and length were shown to be more potent and more selective inhibitors of GSTP1-1 in vitro than the corresponding monofunctional parent compound.71 The effects of these inhibitors on cells , however , have not been described . Small-Molecule Inhibitors Ethacrynic acid EA , Figure 3 , a compound originally used as a diuretic , is probably the most extensively studied GST inhibitor . It is a potent and reversible inhibitor of GSTP1-1 , but it also inhibits isoenzymes of the a and m classes with similar or even higher potency.72 EA has been suggested to induce apoptosis in some cancer cell lines , which can be interpreted to be a consequence of GSTP1-1 inhibition . However , this activity may also be because of inhibition of GSTs of the a and m classes , as these isoenzymes also modulate cell signaling pathways involved in apoptosis . Furthermore , some cancer cell lines have been reported to undergo necrosis , rather than apoptosis , after treatment with EA.73,74 Thus , the cellular effects of EA are most likely the result of a combination of GST inhibition and other mechanisms of cell death . 7-Nitro-2,1,3-benzoxadiazoles have recently been reported to be potent and selective GST inhibitors . The 6-mercapto-hexanol derivative , NBDHEX Figure 3 , showed the stron-gest activity against GSTM2-2 IC50 ? 0.01 mM and GSTP1-1 IC50 ? 0.8 mM , and a much weaker inhibition of GSTA1-1 IC50 ? 25 mM . The compound was cytotoxic against several cancer cell lines K562 , human myeloid leukemia HepG2 , human hepatic carcinoma CCRF-CEM , human T-lympho-blastic leukemia , and GLC-4 , human small cell lung carcino-ma with CC50 values close to the IC50 value obtained for inhibition of GSTP1-1 . Mechanistically , NBDHEX was found to act as a suicide inhibitor of GSTP1-1 it forms a sigma-complex intermediate with GSH that is tightly stabilized at the active site of the enzyme , thus thwarting its catalytic activity . It was also observed that binding of the GSH�NBDHEX complex to GSTP1-1 resulted in the dissociation of the enzyme from JNK . This process triggered a reactive oxygen species ROS -independent activation of the c-Jun�JNK-mediated signal transduction pathway that led to apoptosis in the two leukemic cell lines . A ROS-mediated apoptosis involving the p38-MAPK pathway was also observed in the K562 cell line . Involvement of c-Jun�JNK in NBDHEX-induced apoptosis was confirmed by pre-treatment of the cells with a specific JNK inhibitor , which suppressed apoptosis.75�77 NBDHEX was also cytotoxic against two human melanoma cell lines Me501 and A375 . Apoptosis was observed in both cell lines , although at different times after the addition of the compound . JNK activity was required for NBDHEX to trigger apoptosis , confirming that the JNK signaling pathway is an important therapeutic target for this type of tumor . NBDHEX was also effective in vivo , in which it inhibited tumor growth by 63 and 70 % in the A375 and Me501 melanoma models , respectively.78 NBDHEX showed low toxicity in vivo after intraperitoneal administration to male BDF1 mice . Interestingly , a slight increase in white cells , particularly neutrophils , was observed after treatment with NBDHEX.76 Nitazoxanide NTZ Figure 3 , a member of the thiazolide class of broad-spectrum anti-protozoan drugs , was shown to inhibit GSTP1-1 and induce apoptosis in a colon cancer cell line Caco-2 and in non-transformed human foreskin fibro-blasts HFFs . This effect was more pronounced in the Caco-2 cell line than in the less sensitive HFF cells and correlated with the expression level of GSTP1-1.79 Remarkably , the apoptotic effect of these compounds occurred at concentrations below those required for anti-parasitic activity . Haloenol lactones HELs Figure 3 have been found to be isoenzyme selective and active site-directed inhibitors of GSTs . Preincubation of a representative compound with murine a , m , or p GST isoenzymes resulted in a time-dependent inhibition that was highly selective for GSTp . The enzymatic activity could not be restored after extensive dialysis , suggesting that the compound binds covalently at or near the active site of the enzyme , presumably by reaction with the thiol group of Cys-47 . The effect of this inhibition on JNK activation or cell viability has not been described however , the compound potentiated cisplatin-induced cytotoxicity in both cisplatin-sensitive UOK130 and cisplatin-resistant UOKCR human kidney tumor cell lines that overexpress GSTp .80�82 Natural Product Inhibitors Aloe-emodin Figure 4 , an anthraquinone present in aloe vera leaves , has been shown to induce apoptosis in human hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines . The apoptotic effect is apparently mediated by oxidative stress and sustained JNK activation resulting , at least in part , from GSTP1-1 oxida-tion and subsequent dissociation from the JNK GSTP1-1 complex.83 Benastatins are aromatic polyketides isolated from culture broths of Streptomyces spp . and reported to inhibit human GSTP1-1 . Benastatins A and B were found to be competitive inhibitors of GSTs , with Ki ? 5.0 and 3.7 mM , respectively . Benastatin A Figure 4 induced apoptosis in a colon 26 cancer cell line in which the dominant isoenzyme is GSTp . However , flow cytometry analysis revealed that benastatin A blocked the cell cycle at the G1 G0 phase , suggesting that its apoptotic effect on this cell line may not be due solely to inhibition of GST . Benastatins C and D also inhibited GSTp and stimulated murine lymphocyte blastogenesis in vitro.84,85 Several other natural products , including flavonoids , plant polyphenols , and alkaloids , have been claimed to inhibit GSTP1-1 . However , this inhibition is often not specific , as most of these compounds also inhibit other GST isoenzymes with comparable potency . Thus , their effect on cancer cells , particularly as chemomodulators in cases of GST over-expression , is most likely the result of several mechanisms operating simultaneously . Conclusions Studies performed in recent years have revealed a new role for several GST isoenzymes . In addition to their well-established GSH-conjugating enzymatic activity , GSTs of the a , p , and m classes have been shown to modulate signaling pathways that control cell proliferation , cell differentiation , and cell death by interacting with important signaling proteins in a non-enzymatic way . Among the different GST isoenzymes , GSTP1-1 has received the most attention because it is usually over-expressed in cancer cells and has been associated with the development of tumor resistance to anticancer drugs . In its newly identified role , GSTP1-1 acts as a repressor of JNK and other protein kinases involved in stress response , cell proliferation , and apoptosis . Although the particular details of these interactions are still being elucidated , there is enough evidence to suggest that GSTP1-1 inhibitors may be useful therapeutic agents for the treatment of cancer and other diseases associated with aberrant cell proliferation .

20651742	www.nature.com cdd Apoptosis has a crucial role not only in countless physiological processes e.g. , elimination of redundant cells during verte-brate embryonic development but also during pathogenesis . As apoptosis relies on the clear-cut function of numerous pro-and antiapoptotic factors , any malfunction on their part or disruption of their respective interplay inevitably leads to dysfunctional cellular metabolism . The ensuing delayed or premature cell death often manifests in severe pathologies , including carcinogenesis and neurodegenerative diseases . The groundbreaking discovery of the Caenorhabditis elegans proteins cell death abnormality Ced -9 , homolog of human antiapoptotic Bcl-2 , and Ced-3 , homolog of human caspase-1 , has shown the molecular conservation of the apoptotic cell death program along a broad range of Metazoa , from nematodes to vertebrates.1 Since then , the fundamental role of apoptosis has been increasingly recognized in various physiological processes . In addition , several invertebrate model organisms revealed a significant potential for analyses of apoptotic mechanisms , not only under an evolutionary point of view . Thus , the identification of the human crumbs homolog 1 and its causative role in the manifestation of retinitis pigmentosa was based on the discovery of mutational variants of the Drosophila melanogaster protein crumbs.2 In addition , loss-of-function mutations of the C. elegans dystro-phin-1 gene confirmed the role of human dystrophin in the manifestation of the neuromuscular disease of Duchenne.3 During the last years a novel invertebrate model system has emerged sponges phylum Porifera , which are among the earliest-branching nonbilaterian animals.4 Recent biomarker analyses date the occurrence of probable stem-group poriferans back before the end of the Marinoan glaciation B635 Myr ago 5 and molecular clock analyses estimated that the main poriferan lineages diverged in the Cryogenian Ediacaran , 6 well before the rapid appearance of major metazoan groups Cambrian Explosion . Till today , the model system �Porifera� has revealed several characteristics that have proven valuable for evolutionary studies within a comparative context . The major avail is the phylogenetically basal position of Porifera allowing a unique vantage point on the hypothetical common ancestral taxon , the Urmetazoa . Moreover , comparative transcriptomics and proteomics divulged several examples of poriferan molecules , genetic features , protein domains , among others , that remained conserved throughout evolution , but otherwise have been lost in invertebrate model systems traditionally used , C. elegans and D. melanogaster.7 Furthermore , the majority of poriferan genes show a closer sequence similarity to their human homologs than to the respective molecules of worm and fly similar to some anthozoans , probably caused by an accelerated evolution of the latter animal lineages.8,9 The fine-tuned balance between apoptosis and proliferation is upheld by numerous regulatory molecules that maintain tissue integrity and , ultimately , ensure survival of the organ-ism . The inhibitors of apoptosis IAP family comprises structurally related proteins the presence of at least one baculoviral IAP repeat BIR domain is mandatory that were originally discovered in baculovirus . In addition to their cell death regulating activities , several IAP have a complementary role in cell division , in particular attributed to survivin . Accordingly , the dual role of human survivin is based on its function as i a chromosomal passenger protein that controls segregation of chromatin regulation of cytokinesis and ii a caspase inhibitor that prevents processing activation of caspases.10 As transcription from its single gene locus is upregulated in most of the tumor cell types , survivin is a well-established analytical marker of neoplasms.11,12 The function of survivin homologs in nonbilaterian Metazoa is much less well-defined . Accordingly , similar to vertebrate survivin , the D. melanogaster homolog deterin deters cells from caspase-induced apoptosis and some studies propose an additional pro-proliferative effect.13 On the other hand , the C. elegans survivin homolog BIR-1 seems to be exclusively involved in cytokinesis , in particular during the embryogenesis.14 In this study , we report the discovery and functional characterization of a survivin-like protein SDSURVL from a member of the ancestral-like clade Porifera , Suberites domun-cula . SDSURVL shows both significant sequence homologies to human survivin in particular concerning the BIR domain and a conserved genetic structure . Complementary studies in vivo and in transfected cells suggest a conserved dual role of survivin and , concurrently , indicate a loss of function in certain rapidly evolving and highly adapted metazoan taxa . Results Characterization of the poriferan survivin-like protein SDSURVL . The complete SDSURVL cDNA was isolated from a S. domuncula cDNA library by polymerase chain reaction PCR and degenerate primers that were directed against a conserved region within the BIR domain . SDSURVL consists of 620 nt excluding the poly A tail that encompass an open reading frame ORF of 447 nt excluding the first stop codon , beginning at nt43�45 Metstart . During northern blot analyses , a digoxigenin DIG -labeled probe detected a transcript whose size was consistent with that of the cDNA E650 nt Figure 4a . The deduced protein , SDSURVL , comprises 149 amino acid aa with an expected size of 17 003 Da . Analyses of SDSURVL revealed significant sequence similarity to vertebrate survivin homologs , such as Gallus gallus survivin isoform 1 with an expect value E-value 15 of 2 e 20 32 % identical and 52 % similar aa and human survivin 8 e 18 30 49 % Figure 1a . Considerably lower was the similarity to survivin homologs of more basal Metazoa and fungi , for example , D. melanogaster deterin 7 e 11 45 24 % , placozoan Trichoplax adhaerens survivin-like protein 2 e 11 19 35 % , and Schizosaccha-romyces pombe survivin homolog 5 e 11 34 48 % with respect to the BIR domain aa117 . Viral genomes often 194 encode antiapoptotic or cell-cycle promoting proteins in order to bypass the host defense system . Viral survivin-like proteins generally show lower sequence homology to their metazoan counterparts and in particular to S. domuncula survivin , for example , Epiphyas postvittana nucleopolyhedrovirus IAP-3 4 e 07 17 % aa similarities and Cydia pomonella granulosis virus ORF17 IAP-3 3 e 06 16 % . As SDSURVL features a single BIR domain , a putative nuclear export signal NES , and a coiled-coil region , but is missing a RING domain characteristic of non-survivin IAP , the molecule represents a novel member of the survivin subfamily of IAP . The poriferan BIR domain aa20 has an 93 E-value of 4.85 e 22 and is consistent with the Prosite consensus sequence PS01282 with two exceptions marked in bold HKEPILVY -x 2 -R-x 3,8 -FYW -x 11,14 -STAN -G-LMF -x-FYHDA -x 4 �x 7 -DESL -x 2,3 -C-x 2 -C-x 6 -WA -x 9 -H-x 4 -PRSD -x-C-x 2 -LIVMA . The putative NES aa95 loosely fits a consensus sequence pro-103 posed by , Heger et al.16 L-x 2,3 -FILVMP -x 2 -LI -x-LIV . Furthermore , COILS algorithms indicate the typical COOH - terminal coiled-coil conformation aa127 , usually present 147 in survivin but missing in other IAP family members . Moreover , the conserved threonine residue , whose phosphory-lation by p34cdc2 mediates human survivin activation , 17 is present in SDSURVL aa26 . In addition , a ubiquitin ligase complex-binding destruction motif APCC-D box aa136 141 was predicted . To determine the phylogenetic relationship of survivin-like proteins , molecular phylogenetic analyses were carried out by neighbor-joining NJ , maximum likelihood ML , and Baye-sian methods , including the so far known sequences of metazoan taxa as well as related BIR-containing sequences of viruses and yeast . Accordingly , the resulting composite consensus tree shows the poriferan SDSURVL protein at the base of a monophyletic metazoan clade , whereas viral sequences form a separate monophyletic group Figure 1b . Characterization of the poriferan survivin-like gene SDSURVL . The S. domuncula gene comprises four exons and three introns Figure 2a . Each exon intron border shows typical splicing signals GT-intron-AG . The phases of introns vary the first and third introns are in phase 0 , whereas the second intron is in phase 2 . The human survivin gene shares the same features Figure 2b except for the borders of the third intron AT-intron-GG . Parts of the first and third exons and the complete second exon are encoding the BIR domain Figure 2c . Analyses of the 50-flanking region Figure 2d of human 1 and murine 2 survivin genes reveal the presence of a TATA-less promoter , containing a canonical CpG island and several transcription factor-binding sites.18 However , in silico analyses of the putative poriferan promoter region 3 predicted the presence of a TATA box nt in addition to other cis-regulatory elements , CAAT box nt , and ribosomal - binding site nt . Moreover , similar to the human and murine promoter two putative Sp1 sites nt , have been predicted , although in contrast to the former ones no cell-cycle dependent elements CDE or cell-cycle homology regions CHR have been found in the poriferan non-coding region . Characterization of the poriferan caspase-like protease 2 SDCASL2 . Caspases cysteine-dependent aspartyl-specific proteases are synthesized as zymogens that become activated by scaffold-mediated transactivation or by cleavage using upstream proteases.19 Since the antiapoptotic properties of vertebrate survivin have been functionally linked to inhibition of caspase-7 and -3 , a S. domuncula cDNA library was screened for homologous molecules . The correct size of the resulting clone , SDCASL2 , then was verified on northern blots Figure 4a . SDCASL2 1,827 nt , excluding poly A comprises an ORF between nt175�177 Metstart and nt1738�1740 stop , coding for a putative protein of 521 aa that was termed caspase-like protease 2 SDCASL2 calculated Mr 58,427 . SDCASL2 revealed sequence homology not only to SDCASL E-value 7 e-31 33 % aa identical and 52 % similar aa but also to members of the caspase-7 subfamily , for example , Xenopus laevis and human representatives E-value 3 e-16 21 33 % and 3 e-14 19 35 % , respectively Figure 3 . All caspases contain a CASc domain , which is cleaved into two subunits p10 , p20 during activation . SDCASL2 repre-sents a putative procaspase , comprising subunits p10 aa191 and p20 aa22 , the latter containing the 267 154 characteristic Cys and His active sites Figure 3 . The Cys active site consensus pattern is conserved Prosite pattern PS01122 with two exceptions , marked in bold KL -P-K-LIVMF -LIVMFY -LIVMF 2 -QPD -AF -C-RQG - GE , whereas the histidine active site PS01121 features three alterations , HL -x 2,4 -SC -x 1,2 -A -x-LIVMFY 2 - ST -G-H-G . The absence of a large NH2-terminal prodomain , charac-teristic of initiator caspases , suggests a classification to the group of effector caspases . However , similar to SDCASL , SDCASL2 carries an unusual long COOH-terminal stretch of 254 aa , containing a putative double-stranded RNA-binding motif aa441 PF0035 Pfam . 514 Evolutionary conserved function s of poriferan survivin . To elucidate the controversially discussed ancestral function of survivin or if indeed its dual role is conserved through metazoan evolution , functional analyses were carried out in sponge tissue and primmorphs aggregates of proliferating sponge cells . Moreover , functional conservation was assessed in a heterologous vertebrate cell model SDSURVL-expressing transfected HEK-293 cells that has been previously used to explore expression and functional mechanisms of survivin.20,21 Regulation of proliferation . Comparative northern blot analyses were carried out , showing an increasing level of SDSURVL transcripts during the first 2 weeks of primmorph growth , whereas the control taken immediately after primmorph formation revealed a considerably lower expression level Figure 4a . After 14 days , survivin transcription reached the steady state . On the other hand , in adult sponge tissue survivin transcripts were barely detected . In addition , SDCASL2 expression was very low throughout the experiments , in both primmorphs and sponge tissue Figure 4a . Subsequently , SDSURVL and SDCASL2 expression was investigated in aging primmorphs 2 weeks of age by complementary in situ hybridization studies Figure 4b . For this purpose , primmorph cryosections were incubated with labeled , single-stranded sense control or antisense probes . Both sense probes did not produce specific signals . In contrast , the antisense SDSURVL probe detected survivin transcripts abundantly and homogenously throughout the sections , whereas only few SDCASL2 copies were identified , mainly in the surface cell layer and in cells lining the aquiferous canal system within the mesohyl internal part of the sponge Figure 4b . In parallel , a construct encoding a fusion of SDSURVL and COOH-terminal EGFP SDSURVL-EGFP was introduced into HEK-293 cells . Expression was confirmed microscopi-cally Figure 5b and by immunodetection , using anti-EGFP antibodies Figure 8 expected size of 45 kD corresponding to the SDSURVL�EGFP fusion . The transfection efficiency was determined by the percentage of EGFP-positive HEK-293 cells by fluorescence microscopy . An average transfection efficiency of 94.6 % was calculated . Subsequently , the putative regulatory function of SDSURVL in cytokinesis was explored by monitoring the concentrations of SDSURVL-EGFP-transfected HEK293-SDSURVL and mock-transfected HEK-293 cells , 48 h after transfection Figure 5a . Whereas mock-transfection pro-voked no differences in cell concentration compared with the nontransfected control , SDSURVL-EGFP expression caused a 2.3-fold increase in the number of HEK293-SDSURVL cells significance level Pp0.05 . In addition , trypan blue staining did not show altered cell viability between control and SDSURVL-EGFP-expressing populations . Finally , subcellular localization and nucleocytoplasmic trafficking of SDSURVL-EGFP in transfected cells was analyzed by confocal laser scanning microscopy LSM . For this purpose , HEK293-SDSURVL cells were incubated with the nuclear export inhibitor leptomycin B LMB for 30 min or remained untreated control . After counterstaining of dsDNA with the far-red fluorescent dye DRAQ5 , LSM showed that in the controls SDSURVL-EGFP predominantly localizes in the cytoplasm and , to a lesser degree in the nucleus Figure 6a . Consequently , the fluorescence pattern of the merge revealed a barely detectable colocalization of fusion green and nuclei red . On LMB treatment , SDSURVL-EGFP accumulated in the nucleus . The merged channel clearly depicted a signi-ficant colocalization of nuclei and SDSURVL-EGFP Figure 6b yellow , whereas the staining intensity of cytoplasmic SDSURVL-EGFP is decreased , compared with the untreated control . Regulation of apoptosis . To explore the putative implementation of SDSURVL as a prosurvival factor , SDSURVL and SDCASL2 expression was analyzed in sponge tissue and primmorphs challenged with pro-apoptotic stimulants . Moreover , the viability of mock-transfected and HEK293-SDSURVL cell lines was assessed after the exposure to the same stimuli . Pam3Cys-Ser-Lys 4 and cadmium were used for their selective ability to trigger extrinsic the former compound or intrinsic latter cell death pathways.22,23 Both lipopeptide and heavy metal stimulated the expression of SDSURVL and SDCASL2 in sponge tissue and primmorphs alike , already after 6 h Figure 7 . With prolonged incubation time , the expression level of both transcripts further increased however , this effect was more pronounced in primmorphs than in tissue samples . To assess putative effects of SDSURVL expression , mock-transfected HEK-293 and HEK293-SDSURVL cell lines 95.5 % transfection efficiency were exposed to Pam3Cys-Ser-Lys and cadmium . Then , 3-4,5-di-4 methylthiazol-2-yl -2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide MTT assays , cell death detection enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ELISA , and western blot analyses were carried out . MTT assays revealed that the lipopeptide did not alter cell viabilities , neither in mock-transfected nor in HEK293-SDSURVL cells , compared with untreated control cells Figure 8a . In addition , Pam3Cys-Ser-Lys treatment did 4 not change the amount of survivin endogenous as well as poriferan . In contrast , both cell lines were sensitive to cadmium . Thus , MTT assays showed that 46.7 % of mock-transfected cells underwent cell death after 12 h of exposure . Nevertheless , SDSURVL expression rescued HEK293-SDSURVL , as only 25.6 % cells were nonviable Figure 8b significance level Pp0.05 . Furthermore , western blot ana-lyses showed an additional effect of cadmium , as increased immunodetection was observed of both , human survivin and its poriferan homolog after 6�12 h of challenge . Concurrently , cell death detection ELISA could not reveal altered formation of mono-and oligonucleosomes , neither in mock-transfected nor HEK293-SDSURVL cells after Pam3Cys-Ser-Lys treatment , compared with untreated 4 control cells Figure 9a . In contrast , exposure to cadmium significantly induced apoptotic DNA fragmentation in both cell lines . However , SDSURVL expression caused a reduced DNA fragmentation by 51 % Figure 9b significance level Pp0.05 . Discussion Survivin represents a unique protein within the IAP family , containing a single BIR domain and a COOH-terminal coiled-coil structure . Thus , it differs from all other family members that comprise 2�3 BIR domains and a canonical COOH-terminal RING finger.11 In vertebrates , survivin not only controls cell cycle checkpoints and correct completion of cytokinesis but also regulates activation of caspases.24 However , the evolutionary conservation of this dual role remains inconclusive , as in Nematoda the survivin homolog seems to be implicated exclusively in cytokinesis.25 In addition , even though a fungal S. pombe survivin-like protein was proposed to be required for efficient cell division and exhibits antiapoptotic activity , 26 it is considerably larger in size than other survivin proteins . Key regulators of apoptosis and cell cycle progression have already been discovered in the phylum Porifera , 27 which seems to be the earliest-branching metazoan taxon.4 However , identification of poriferan survivin provides an important tool not only to investigate the primordial function s of this versatile regulator protein , but also to elucidate the putative ancient and intimate link between apoptosis , proliferation , and morphogenesis . The newly discovered poriferan survivin homolog showed a significant degree of sequence conservation . A consensus tree resulting of NJ , ML , and Bayesian analyses places SDSURVL at the base of a metazoan clade , confirming the common ancestry of metazoan survivin-like proteins , whereas viral sequences form a well-supported separate group . SDSURVL features all characteristics of survivins that facilitate protein interaction and mediate both antiapoptotic activity and proper kinetochore attachment.28 However , it shows several additional putative domains that are known to be involved in cell cycle regulatory functions i APCC-D box , required for ubiquitination and proteasome-mediated degra-dation by the anaphase-promoting ubiquitin ligase complex APC C ii LIG_FHA1 2 motifs aa98 aa100 that 104 106 bind regulators of the G2 M checkpoint iii USP7-binding motif aa33 that is a target of the UPS7 deubiquitinating 37 enzyme , whose substrates are regulators of cell survival pathways . So far , no such feature has been described for other survivin molecules . The gene structure intron exon positions , intron phases is conserved between poriferan and vertebrate human , murine survivin , 18 but not within the D. melanogaster deterin , 13 which possesses only two introns . However , some differences to the vertebrate promoter region are noticeable the TATA-less vertebrate promoter includes CpG islands and several Sp1 , CDE , and CHR sites . By analogy with other cell cycle-regulated genes it was postulated that Sp1 regulates basal transcriptional expression of the survivin gene , further modulated by CDE CHR elements , thus imparting cell cycle periodicity of survivin expression.18 In contrast , the poriferan promoter features a canonical TATA box , two Sp1 sites , and is missing CDE CHR elements . Therefore , considering the aforementioned protein interaction motifs , regulation of the poriferan survivin pool might also occur on a posttranscrip-tional proteasomal level , for example , by de ubiquitination or complex formation with other regulatory proteins . Survivin is expressed in many human tumors and in rapidly dividing cells of fetal tissue during the G2 M phase , but is not detectable in terminally differentiated cells . It was proposed that survivin exerts its antiapoptotic function by inhibiting caspases , particularly caspase-7 and -3,29 though other studies argue against a direct mechanism of caspase inhibition by survivin , see for example , Banks et al.30 To approach the enigmatic role of survivin in nonbilaterian Metazoa , comparative functional studies of poriferan survivin were conducted . Accordingly , the implementation of SDSURVL in cell proliferation and cell death was studied in sponges as well as in a human cell model HEK-293 as SDSURVL�EGFP fusion . This strategy had already been successfully adopted to assess the antiapoptotic potential of deterin and poriferan B-cell lymphoma Bcl -2.31,32 Moreover , survivin�EGFP fusions have been widely used to study both the bifunctional role of survivin and its dynamic intracellular localization and seem fully functional.33�35 In contrast to sponge tissue that show a very low steady-state expression level , proliferating cells of primmorphs contained a considerable amount of SDSURVL , indicative of its involvement in cell division . This assumption was supported by a significantly increased proliferation rate of HEK-293 cells expressing SDSURVL-EGFP . In addition , application of two inducers of cell death cadmium , Pam3Cys-Ser-Lys indicated an antiapoptotic function of 4 SDSURVL , as both compounds triggered the expression of SDSURVL in sponge tissue and primmorphs , possibly a countermeasure to the induced expression of the caspase-7 homolog SDCASL2 . Concurrently , cadmium induced apop-tosis in HEK-293 cells , although concomitant expression of SDSURVL-EGFP drastically reduced the occurrence of cell death E50 % . However , Pam3Cys-Ser-Lys incubation 4 did not alter HEK-293 cell viability , probably because of the different repertoire of Toll-like receptors mediating lipopeptide-induced innate immunity and apoptosis found chromosome segregation and cytokinesis . As Crm1 is involved in tethering the CPC to the centromere by interacting with survivin�s NES , 10 SDSURVL might affect various stages of cell proliferation , from proper kinetochore attachment to spindle formation . In conclusion , the identification of a bona fide poriferan survivin homolog represents a compelling opportunity to investigate the deep evolutionary original function s of survivin , whereas concurrently avoiding limitations of classical invertebrate model organisms . The data presented propose an evolutionary ancient dual regulatory role of survivin , implemented in cell cycle control and programmed cell death . Materials and Methods Preparation of S. domuncula tissue and primmorphs . Specimens of the marine sponge Suberites domuncula Porifera , Demospongiae , Hadromerida were collected near Rovinj Croatia in the northern Adriatic Sea and then kept in aquaria in Mainz Germany at 171C . Primmorphs were obtained after tissue dissociation into single cells as described earlier.37 They were cultured in natural sterile-filtered seawater Sigma-Aldrich , Taufkirchen , Germany , supplemented with 0.2 % v v RPMI-1640 medium Biochrom AG , Berlin , Germany and 60 mM silicate . Cultures were shaken for 5 days to assist the formation of aggregates , consisting of proliferating cells . Then , two sets of experiments were performed . For the first set , primmorphs were exposed to cadmium CdCl2 , Sigma-Aldrich 50 mM or the synthetic lipopeptide S -2,3-bis palmitoyloxy -2-RS -propyl -N-palmitoyl-R -Cys-S -Ser-S -Lys4-OH 3HCl Pam3Cys-Ser-Lys 4 Axxora Grunberg , � Germany 40 mg ml for 6 and 9 h , or they remained untreated as a control . For the second set of experiments , samples were taken 0 control , 7 , 14 , and 21 days after primmorph formation . All experiments were performed under mild shaking . In a similar way , S. domuncula tissue was exposed to cadmium 50 mM or Pam3Cys-Ser-Lys 4 40 mg ml for up to 12 h . RNA extraction and northern blotting analyses . Total RNA was isolated through lysis of homogenized tissue primmorphs using TRIzol Reagent Invitrogen , Karlsruhe , Germany as described earlier.38 Subsequently , 5 mg of total RNA was size separated and blotted on Hybond N1 membranes Amersham , Freiburg , Germany . Labeled probes were generated with DIG-11-deoxyuridine triphosphate through the PCR-DIG-Probe Synthesis Kit according to the manufacturer�s instructions Roche Applied Science , Mannheim , Germany . Hybridization was carried out with a S. domuncula survivin-like probe SDSURVL , nt1 357 or a caspase-like protease 2 probe SdCASL2 , nt810 1480 . Furthermore , a probe was designed to detect the expression of the housekeeping gene b-tubulin SDTUB , nt83 483 NCBI accession number AJ550806 as internal reference . Hybridized probes were detected with anti-DIG Fab fragments conjugated to alkaline phosphatase and ultimately visualized by chemiluminescence , using the 1,2-dioxetane compound CDP Star Roche as substrate . Cloning of S. domuncula survivin-like protein and caspase-like protease 2 . cDNA coding for the survivin-like protein SDSURVL was isolated from a S. domuncula cDNA library39 by PCR with degenerate primers that were designed against the conserved BIR domain forward primer , 50-GAT GGC IGA GGC T CGG CTT-30 reverse primmer , 50-CT CA TGT CCA GTT TT CA AG AA-30 where I ? inosine . PCR was carried out at an initial denaturation at 951C for 5 min , followed by 35 amplification cycles at 951C for 30 s , 541C for 45 s , and 721C for 1 min , and terminated with a final extension at 721C for 10 min .

20671746	Physiological oxygen O2 concentrations in tissues are much lower than in atmospheric air 20 % , ranging from 14 % in pulmonary alveoli to o1 % in several organs.1 Numerous publications show the major role of variations of O2 concentration in the responses of normal cells , trans-formed cells and leukemic cells from primoculture or from continuous cell lines.2�8 Low O2 concentration induces apoptosis or cell survival , proliferation or quiescence , self-renewal or differentiation , depending on the degree of hypoxia , the cell type and the level of differentiation . Response to hypoxia is largely dependent on hypoxia-inducible factor 1 HIF-1 , a heterodimeric transcription factor . At O2 concentrations o5 % , the HIF-1a subunit is no longer degraded by the proteasome9,10 and dimerizes with HIF-1b . The active complex then induces the expression of numerous genes including those of growth factors erythropoietin Epo and vascular endothelial growth factor VEGF , transcription factors and cell cycle proteins.11�14 In bone marrow , hematopoietic cells are permanently exposed to O2 concentrations ranging from 4 % in capillaries to o0.1 % in endosteal areas , 15�17 in which the most primitive stem cells reside.18,19 Hematopoietic stem cells HSCs are better preserved in cultures at low O2 1�3 % than at atmospheric O2 concentration 20 % .5,20,21 We previously showed that culture at 0.1 % O2 prevents cord blood G0 CD34 ? cells to enter in active cell cycle and induces those in active proliferation to re-enter in G0.22 The effects of low O2 concentration on the survival , proliferation and differentiation of normal and leukemic hematopoietic progenitors are more controversial . Indeed , in some articles a pro-differentiative effect6,23�25 was pointed out , whereas in others it was suggested that oxygen levels o1 % block cell proliferation and induce their rapid disappearance from cultures , probably by inducing apoptosis.4,21,26,27 Culture at low O2 concentration 0.5 % causes cell cycle arrest in G1 of mouse embryonic fibroblasts and splenic B lymphocytes by inducing Rb hypophosphorylation and p27KIP1 upregulation.28,29 All these results led us to explore the effects of low O2 concentration on the proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic progenitors . Extensive protein studies using normal human or murine primoculture progeni-tor cells were quite unfeasible for two reasons heterogeneity of the CD34 ? cell population and difficulty of obtaining them in large numbers . As the murine cell line , factor-dependent cell Paterson FDCP -Mix , which is less heterogeneous , has major features of normal hematopoietic progenitors , we tested its response to hypoxia . Indeed , FDCP-Mix cells have a normal karyotype , are non-leukemic , strictly depend on IL-3 for their survival and proliferation , and differentiate toward different myeloid lineages when cultured with other cyto-kines.30 Varying the concentrations of O2 from 20 to 0.1 % in cultures of FDCP-Mix cells had a time-dependent effect on their proliferation and cell cycle , with cells reaching quies-cence G0 after 72 h of culture at 0.1 % O2 . We then used these cells to analyze the self-renewal proliferation differen-tiation balance and the variations of p27KIP1 levels and pRb phosphorylation , the two proteins potentially involved in G0 cell cycle arrest . Results Very low O2 concentration 0.1 % induces FDCP-Mix cell arrest in G0 . We then analyzed the FDCP-Mix cell cycle status after 24 , 48 and 72 h of culture at 20 and 0.1 % O2 , using double labeling with propidium iodide PI , a quantitative DNA fluorescent dye and anti-Ki-67 antibodies Ki-67 antigen is expressed in the nucleus of cycling cells and absent from G0 cells to discriminate cells in G0 DNA ? 2N Ki-67 from cells in G1 DNA ? 2N Ki-67 ? , S 2N o DNA o4N Ki-67 ? and G2 M DNA ? 4N Ki-67 ? . As shown in Figure 2a , the percentage of FDCP-Mix cells in G0 remained stable 13.6�2.3 % during 72 h of culture at 20 % O2 . In contrast , at 0.1 % O2 the percentage of G0 cells significantly increased to 48.8�5.4 % after 72 h of culture , whereas the percentage of cells in G1 , S and G2 M decreased in parallel Figure 2b�d . To determine whether this G0 phase accumulation was due to cells previously in G0 and G1 or because of cells entering in G0 after one or several divisions , FDCP-Mix cells labeled with carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl diester CFSE a stable vital cellular fluorescent dye whose decay allows to analyze cell divisions were cultured for 72 h at 20 % O2 and at 0.1 % O2 . At this time point , division rates CFSE labeling and cell cycle status Ki-67 ? or Ki-67 of cultured FSCP-Mix cells were co-analyzed by flow cytometry FCM . As shown by the comparison of panels b and c in Figure 3 , the division rate of FDCP-Mix cells was slower at 0.1 % than at 20 % O2 . This is because of the 10 Very low O2 concentration inhibits FDCP-Mix cell growth . Low O2 concentration induced a time-dependent FDCP-Mix growth inhibition Figure 1a . The number of living cells at 24 h was not significantly different in 20 % O2 versus 0.1 % O2 concentration cultures , nor was their doubling time approximately 30 h in both conditions Figure 1b . At later time points , the growth of FDCP-Mix cells cultured at 0.1 % O2 was dramatically reduced , with a doubling time that reached 104 h after 448 h of culture . As the percentage of apoptotic cells in two conditions was similar Figure 1c after 24 , 48 and 72 h of culture , we concluded that the growth arrest observed at 0.1 % O2 was because of the inhibition of proliferation of FDCP-Mix cells after 24 h . 0 hours 80 60 time 40 doubling 20 100 association of two cell cycle events 1 the extension of the cell cycle duration as concluded from the respective percentages of Ki-67 ? cells in each division class and 2 the progressive accumulation of G0 cells after each division revealed by comparing the percentages of Ki-67 cells in each division class at 20 and 0.1 % O2 . Very low O2 concentration 0.1 % induces the differentiation of a majority of FDCP-Mix cells . May - Grunwald � Giemsa staining of FDCP-Mix cytospins showed that after 72 h of culture at 0.1 % O2 , the majority of cells acquired a granulo-monocytic differentiation Figure 4a that was confirmed by FCM analysis of the expression of Gr-1 granulocytic differentiation marker , Mac-1 monocytic differentiation marker , as well as CD34 and CD117 markers of primitive hematopoietic progenitors cell surface markers Figure 4b�d . Indeed , after 3 days of culture at 0.1 % O2 , the percentage of cells positive for Gr-1 and CD117 , respectively , increased from 26 to 63 % and decreased from 27 to 14 % Figure 4b and c . In parallel , as expected , we observed a decrease in the mean fluorescence intensity MFI of the CD34 primitive marker together with an increase in the MFI of the granulo-monocytic marker Mac-1 and Gr-1 Figure 4d . These results confirmed that culture at 0.1 % O2 induces the granulo-monocytic differentiation of the FDCP-Mix cell line . Very low O2 concentration 0.1 % also maintains a minor population of FDCP-Mix cells with culture-repopulating ability CRA . FDCP-Mix cells issued from 72 h of liquid culture LC1 at 0.1 % O2 were sequentially replated every 72 h at 1.105 cells ml at 20 % O2 to test their ability to repopulate later LCs LC2�LC5 , as determined by counting the total number of cells in LC2 to LC5 CRAcell . The growth rate of cells incubated in LC1 at atmospheric O2 concentration remained stable throughout the experiment Figure 5a , left part of the graph . The growth rate of cells issued from LC1 incubated at 0.1 % O2 Figure 5a , right part of the graph in nonselective , normoxic LC2�LC5 Figure 5a remained stable during LC2 and LC3 , increased during LC4 and reached the growth rate showed by cells incubated in normoxic LC1 during LC5 . In the meantime , the percentage of cells in G0 decreased and the percentage of cells in G1 , S and G2 M started to increase during LC2 to reach control levels at LC4 data not shown . To confirm that this progressive repopulation of LC was because of the maintenance in hypoxia of a limited cell subpopulation , 80 60 % 40 Cells 20 0 80 60 % 40 Cells 20 0 cells rescued from nonselective normoxic LC2�LC5 were cultured in semisolid medium to identify and count , after 11 days , the number of colonies issued from colony-forming cell CFC . The percentage of these CRACFC cells at the end of 0.1 % O2 LC1 was 14 times lower than after 20 % LC1 and progressively returned to similar values in LC4 Figure 5b . Relationships between G0 quiescence , Gr-1 expression and CRACFC cells . As the differentiation after 3 days of culture at 0.1 % O2 was accompanied by the G0 entry of a large percentage of FDCP-Mix cells , we explored the relationship between these two phenomena . As a first step , we sorted Gr-1 ? and Gr-1 cells after 3 days of LC1 at 20 or 0.1 % O2 . The microscopic observation on May-Grunwald� Giemsa cytospins Figure 6a confirmed that Gr-1 ? cells had a typical morphology of terminally differentiated granulocytes including donut-shaped nuclei arrows c , whereas Gr-1-cells kept round nuclei with more basophilic cytoplasm as observed in control culture conditions Figure 4a . At both O2 concentrations , all CRAcell-and CRACFC-type cells were contained within the Gr-1 population Figure 6b and c . Analysis of the cell cycle status of Gr-1 ? and Gr-1 cells showed that CRA-type undifferentiated Gr-1 cells were mostly cycling , whereas differentiated Gr-1 ? cells without CRA were in G0 Figure 6d . In addition , a 24-h treatment of FDCP-Mix cells with 5FU 10 mg ml at the end of LC1 , followed by medium renewal and replating in LC2 , dramatically decreased CRAcell and CRACFC similarly in both O2 conditions data not shown . Altogether , these data show that at very low 0.1 % O2 concentration , most FDCP-Mix cells differentiate and enter in the quiescent G0 status , whereas a minority of undifferentiated cells , those that maintain the self-renewal of the cell line , remain in active cell cycle . 103 102 b 104 103 102 c 104 103 102 FDCP-Mix cells in G0 overexpress hypophosphorylated pRb and p27KIP1 proteins . Because of their role in the regulation of cell cycling , we analyzed the total amount of p27KIP1 and pRb proteins and the phosphorylation status of pRb after 24 , 48 and 72 h of culture at 20 % O2 and 0.1 % . O2 . As expected , the total quantity of pRb protein remained stable and similar during 72 h culture at 20 and 0.1 % O2 Figure 7a . The S-phase transition is dependent on pRb phosphorylation on several specific sites . Therefore , we studied this protein phosphorylation status . Indeed , unphosphorylated pRb progressively increased whereas phosphorylated pRb disappeared during 72 h culture of FDCP-Mix cells at 0.1 % O2 data not shown . We then analyzed several pRb phosphorylation sites involved in the G1 to S-phase transition . The Ser 608 , Ser 807 811 and Thr 821 sites stably phosphorylated at 20 % O2 became very faint at 0.1 % O2 Figure 7b . In the meantime , the p27KIP1 level in FDCP-Mix cells strongly increased during cultures at 0.1 % O2 , whereas it remained stable at 20 % O2 Figure 8a . Upregulation of the p27KIP1 protein by hypoxia in FDCP-Mix cells was partly related to transcriptional mechanisms as p27KIP1 mRNA level significantly increased during cultures at 0.1 % O2 2.76 - , 3-and 2.4-fold at 24 , 48 and 72h , respectively Figure 8b . To know whether the regulation of the p27KIP1 protein was linked to the G0 quiescence and differentiation of the FDCP-Mix cell line , we explored its expression in the Gr-1 and Gr-1 ? populations by flow cytometry . Both the level of p27KIP1 fluorescence intensity Figure 8c and d and the percentages of cells expressing high levels of p27KIP1 were different in Gr-1 and Gr-1 ? cells . In the past 10 years , an increasing number of publications were devoted to the physiological low bone marrow O2 concentrations from o0.1 % O2 in sub-endosteal bone marrow niches to 4�5 % in vascular areas compared with 21 % in atmospheric air and to the exploration of their role in the regulation of hematopoiesis.1,15,16 We and others showed that varying O2 concentrations from 20 to 0.1 % in cultures of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells modified their quiescence versus proliferation and self-renewal versus differentiation balances.2,4�7,19�23,31�33 To investigate the molecules and mechanisms involved in these phenomena , we used the FDCP-Mix hematopoietic cell line that is considered to share numerous phenotypic and functional properties with bone marrow hematopoietic progenitors . Indeed , FDCP-Mix cells have a normal karyotype , are non-leukemic , strictly depend on IL-3 for their survival and proliferation , and differentiate towards different myeloid lineages when cultured with other cytokines.30 In addition , when cultured at 0.1 % O2 , cycling FDCP-Mix cell line progressively accumulated in G0 after one to few divisions . This accumulation in G0 was accompanied by a major granulo-monocytic differentiation , as shown by sorting Gr-1 ? differentiated and Gr-1 undifferentiated FDCP-Mix cells after 3 days of culture at 20 and 0.1 % O2 . In both O2 conditions , the Gr-1 FDCP-Mix subset had a high CRA and a high percentage of cycling cells , whereas the Gr-1 ? differentiated fraction was mostly in G0 with a quite null CRA . This result suggests a link between cell cycle arrest and differentiation . Some articles found a differentiating effect of low O2 concentrations on leukemic cells , either from primoculture or from cell lines6,23�25 similar to the one observed with FDCP-Mix cells . In contrast , Giuntoli et al.8 showed that when the K562 cell line issued from a blast-crisis chronic myeloid leukemia � an HSC malignancy � patient was cultured at 0.1 % O2 for 7 days , the number of cells dramatically decreased by 1 log and most cells underwent apoptosis , whereas a minor hypoxia-resistant subpopulation repopulated LC2 incubated at 20 % O2 , showing full CRA maintenance . Using the murine MEL cell line , they obtained similar results , and found , in addition , at 0.1 % O2 a quiescent subset of CRA cells that resisted to 5FU treatment.4 However , in these two articles , cell differentiation was not studied . When the FDCP-Mix cell line was cultured under similar conditions , apoptosis did not increase significantly , and most cells underwent proliferation arrest and differentiated , whereas a small population of slowly cycling CRA cells as killed by 24 h of 5FU persisted after 3 and even 7 days of culture at 0.1 % O2 . These differences between FDCP-Mix and the leukemic cell lines that differentiate in hypoxia on one hand and K562 , MEL and CD34 ? cells on the other could be due 1 to the fact that FDCP-Mix and the leukemic cell lines that differentiate in hypoxia6,23�25 derive from progenitors and not from HSC , 2 to their lower sensitivity to apoptosis than primary CD34 ? cells in hypoxic cultures owing to their immortalized status but this does not apply to the K562 and MEL cell lines or 3 to an association of both phenomena . Our previous results showing that primoculture progenitors disappear rapidly during cultures of murine bone marrow or human CD34 ? cells at 1 % O221,27 whereas leukemic and FDCP-Mix cell lines survive and differentiate strengthen the hypothesis that the maturation of FDCP-Mix cells in hypoxia is linked to their acquired immortalized status . This allows their prolonged survival as differentiated cells in hypoxia , whereas primoculture progenitors rapidly die in these conditions before reaching maturation . The permanent cycling of CRA type and the absence of apoptosis in cultures of FDCP-Mix cells at very low O2 count count Gr-1 Mac-1 concentration that contrasts with the apoptosis of a large percentage and the quiescence of a minority of primoculture CD34 ? and MEL cells can not be explained by the immorta-lized status of FDCP-Mix , as MEL is also a permanent and leukemic cell line . We suggest that this major functional difference in response to very low O2 concentrations is because of the �stem� or �progenitor� cell status of these different cell types . Together , the above-mentioned results with primary CD34 ? cells , K562 cells , other leukemic cell lines and our present work imply that regulation by very low O2 concentrations o1 % of cycling , differentiation and survival , depending on the differentiation level of cells stem cells versus progenitors whether normal or leukemic tissue , is in question . These results led us to explore the molecules involved in the cell cycle modifications induced by hypoxia . The G0 and or G1 undefined as neither Ki-67 nor any other G0 marker was used quiescence of fibroblasts and B lymphocytes induced by serum starvation or hypoxia is linked to p27KIP1 increase that blocks the cyclin cyclin-dependent kinase CDK activity , thus leading to pRb hypophosphorylation.11,28,29,34�37 Con-versely , phosphorylations of pRb on multiple Ser Thr sites by cyclin CDK during the G1 phase lead to the release of molecules required for the transition to S phase.38 In brief , the phosphorylation of Thr 821 releases histone deacetylase the phosphorylation of Ser 807 811 releases c-abl and the -5 x10 Living % 5 Colony phosphorylation of Ser 608 participates in the release of the master transcription factor E2F . These three molecules have a major role in the G1 to S transition . Hypoxia dramatically reduced the phosphorylation of these three pRb sites in FDCP-Mix cells , suggesting that dephosphorylated pRb participate to their quiescence . Hypoxia also induced a significant increase in the p27KIP1 protein and mRNA in FDCP-Mix cells . Finally , we showed that the quiescent differentiated Gr-1 ? cells expressed higher p27KIP1 levels than the Gr-1 cycling cells , a fraction containing CRA cells . That is most probably responsible for the accumulation of unphosphorylated pRb . Our present data that extend personal preliminary results39 are similar to those very recently published by Eliasson et al.40 Altogether , they show that p27KIP1 is involved in the regulation of FDCP-Mix cell cycling in hypoxia . The last important point of our work is that it revealed a minor stem cell-like subpopulation that repopulates LCs after returning them to 20 % O2 of the FDCP-Mix cell line that kept its self-renewal potential after 3�7 days of culture at 0.1 % O2 . Similar to both normal stem cells and cancer cells , the CRA-type FDCP-Mix cells are highly O2 independent , as they survive and proliferate in nearly anoxic conditions 0.1 % O2 . Further experiments will explore 1 the metabolic peculia-rities of the low-energy proliferation mechanism of Gr-1 FDCP-Mix cells , 2 the relationship of this mechanism to self-renewal divisions uncoupled to differentiation and 3 the roles of HIF-1 , p27KIP1 and pRb in the regulation of balance between quiescence and differentiation of FDCP-Mix .

20685205	a r t i c l e i n f o Article history Keywords 1 . Introduction Glaucoma is an age-related optic neuropathy characterized by the loss of retinal ganglion cells RGCs , excavation of the optic disc , and progressive visual field loss . An ageing population and sub-optimal therapies results in this disease ranking as the leading cause of irreversible blindness in the world Quigley and Broman , 2006 . Current pharmalogical and surgical glaucoma treatments act by reducing intraocular pressure IOP , the most important risk factor for the onset and progression of the condition . However , some glaucoma patients continue to lose vision rapidly due to uncontrollable IOP or even despite reasonable therapeutic IOP control . Therefore , novel adjunctive glaucoma treatments capable of halting RGC death and functional loss are urgently required . Neuroprotective strategies for glaucoma aim to prevent optic nerve degeneration through direct or indirect action on RGCs . Here we review the potential of neurotrophic factor NTF delivery strategies for clinical translation in glaucoma therapy . We begin by identifying key mechanisms and examining the role that NTF deprivation and dysfunction plays in glaucomatous pathophysi-ology . We then evaluate the efficacy of attempts to confer NTF-mediated neuroprotection in experimental glaucoma models via direct application , slow-release devices , gene therapy , and cell transplantation . In addition , the obstacles to clinical translation are addressed . NTFs are small , secreted proteins that play important roles in the development and maintenance of the nervous system . While numerous NTFs are expressed throughout the central and periph-eral nervous systems , those most applicable to glaucoma primarily belong to the nerve growth factor NGF and the 130 kDa glyco-protein GP130 cytokine families . In addition , a strong neuro-protective role for glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor GDNF has been suggested . Simplified signaling pathways associated with these factors are presented in Fig. 1 . The NGF-family of neurotrophins is composed of NGF , brain-derived neurotrophic factor BDNF , NT-3 , NT-4 , and NT-5 . BDNF is expressed in tissues throughout the body and is well known to play an important role in RGC survival . BDNF is produced locally by RGCs Herzog and von Bartheld , 1998 and retinal astrocytes Moretto et al. , 1994 , but is also synthesized in the brain where it is taken up by RGC axon terminals and transported retrogradely , bound to its receptor , to the retina . This retrograde transport of BDNF is an important survival signal for RGCs . In addition , other members of the NGF family are also produced in the retina Garcia et al. , 2003 Rudzinski et al. , 2004 . NGF-family neurotrophins bind to two different receptors high-affinity binding via tropomyosin receptor kinase Trk -A , B , or C , and also lowaffinity nerve growth factor receptor LNGFR also known as p75 . Specifically , NGF binds TrkA BDNF , NT-4 and NT-5 bind TrkB NT-3bindsTrkC andallbindp75.RGCsexpressallof thesereceptors , except possibly TrkC Garcia et al. , 2003 Rudzinski et al. , 2004 Agarwal et al. , 2007 . Binding of ligand to Trk receptors induces dimerization and autophosphorylation followed by activation of downstream signaling cascades which includethe Ras Raf MEK ERK and PI3-K Akt mTOR pathways . This signaling cascade generally induces pro-survival and or pro-growth cellular responses . Conversely , signalingviap75 , inassociationwithitspartnerLINGO-1 , activates the small G-proteins Rac1 and Cdc42 which in turn trigger Jun N-terminal kinase JNK activity and promotion of apoptosis . As such , the overall effects of these NTFs are dictated by a balance of signaling cascades triggered by different receptor types Chao et al. , 1998 . In addition , Trk ligand complexes are internalized and retro-gradely transported to the cell body , which appears to contribute to their signalingefficacy Bhattacharyya et al. , 1997 Riccio et al. , 1997 . The GP130 cytokine family represents another group of molecules that may be applicable to glaucoma therapies . CNTF , leukemia inhibitory factor LIF and interleukin IL -6 are all members of this family which signal via receptor complexes that include CNTF-receptor a , LIF-receptor b , and GP130 . Receptor activation stimulates the JAK STAT pathway , which in turn regu-lates gene expression . Research has mostly focused on CNTF which is expressed throughout the neural retina , the retinal pigmented epithelium , and in the optic nerve head Beltran et al. , 2003 Liu et al. , 2007 . Finally , GDNF is a small NTF belonging to the TGF-b superfamily that binds to a receptor complex composed of Ret a receptor tyrosine kinase and GDNF-receptor a1 or a2 . Ligand binding acti-vates intracellular signaling pathways including MAP kinase , PI3K , PLC-g , and Src-family kinases Sariola and Saarma , 2003 . GDNF is secreted by glial cells Moretto et al. , 1996 and GDNF-a receptors are expressed by RGCs and amacrine cells Karlsson et al. , 2002 , as well M�ller glia where their activation induces secretion of other growth factors Hauck et al. , 2006 . Blockade of retrograde axonal transport in RGCs by ocular hypertension OHT is thought to contribute to the pathogenesis of glaucoma by triggering apoptosis due to reduced bioavailability of essential survival factors to the retina Quigley , 1995 , 1999 . Generalized impairments in optic nerve axonal transport were identified in primates following IOP elevation as early as the 1970s Anderson and Hendrickson , 1974 Quigley and Anderson , 1976 Minckler et al. , 1977 Quigley and Addicks , 1980 . Similar findings have been reported in rodent glaucoma models Kim et al. , 2004 Salinas-Navarro et al. , 2010 and in post-mortem tissue from patients with secondary glaucoma that induced high IOP Knox et al. , 2007 . Furthermore , optic nerve NTF-specific transport blockade in acute experimental OHT has been reported in rats Pease et al. , 2000 . In this study , TrkB clearly accumulated within the optic nerve head in response to elevated IOP , which implies blockade of receptor ligand complex retrograde transport . Similar focal accumulation of TrkB was observed in monkeys with chronic OHT Pease et al. , 2000 and in dogs with primary glaucoma Iwabe et al. , 2007 . In addition , OHT has been found to reduce the trans-port of radiolabeled BDNF to the retina Pease et al. , 2000 . In an elegant study , Quigley et al. 2000 clarified that this effect on BDNF transport involved disruption of active axonal transport . Further-more , impaired dynein motility may be involved in NTF transport blockade in acute and chronic OHT conditions Martin et al. , 2006 . However , it has not been determined whether current ocular hypotensive therapies can restore physiological BDNF transport in the optic nerve to alleviate RGC death . While the theory of NTF deprivation by transport blockade might partially explain the mechanism of glaucomatous RGC death , as reviewed by Johnson et al. 2009 , limitations to this hypothesis do exist . For instance , some NTFs are expressed endogenously in the retina , although the bioactivity of endogenous retinal BDNF , compared to that transported from the brain , has been questioned Quigley et al. , 2000 . In addition , changes in NTF receptor expression as a result of elevated IOP could alter the effects of NTFs on RGC survival . For example , while retinal NGF expression is upregulated following OHT , it coincides with RGC loss because the expression ratio of TrkA to p75 in the retina and optic nerve is shifted in favor of p75 Coassin et al. , 2008 Sposato et al. , 2008 . Because TrkA and p75 are associated with opposing downstream signaling pathways , the overall changes in receptor expression favor the p75-mediated pro-apoptotic Bax signal . Moreover , Guo et al. 2009 found no significant change in BDNF , NGF , NT-3 , NT-4 , or NT-5 protein levels in the retina associated with glaucoma , but they did observe complex changes in NTF receptor mRNA and protein levels in conjunction with an increase in pro-apoptotic signals mediated by Jun and activating transcription factor Atf -3 . Therefore , the effects of OHT on RGC survival are unlikely due to NTF deprivation alone , but also dysfunction of multiple NTF signaling pathway components , including receptor expression Rudzinski et al. , 2004 . As a result , the effects of therapeutic NTF administration on RGC survival may change over time and deter-mining an optimal dose of NTFs to promote RGC survival may prove difficult . Another member of the NGF family which binds TrkB and has been implicated in glaucoma pathogenesis is NT-4 . A recent mutation screen Pasutto et al. , 2009 of the NT4 gene in 399 glaucoma patients identified 6 heterozygous missense mutations in 9 patients 2 % which are predicted to impact TrkB interaction and dimerization . In contrast , no such mutations were found in a control group of 376 age-matched healthy control subjects . The authors of this study went on to show experimentally that the most common mutation R206W reduced the ability of NT-4 to activate TrkB in PC12 cells . Interestingly , NT-4 lies on chromosome 19q13.33 , a locus previously associated with glaucoma in a genome-wide linkage scan Wiggs et al. , 2000 . Alterations in expression patterns and activity of other NTFs have also been observed in models of glaucoma . For example , expression of CNTF and FGF was found to decline following epis-cleral vein ligation-induced OHT while BDNF and GDNF expression remained steady Yu et al. , 2006b . In contrast , another study using the same model found an increase in CNTF mRNA and protein expression over time Wu et al. , 2007 . Furthermore , other retinal injury models , including optic nerve transection Valter et al. , 2005 and needle incision Cao et al. , 1997 , 2001 , have been associated with increases in retinal expression of FGF and CNTF . Interestingly , while STAT3 activation by CNTF is thought to be neuroprotective in RGCs Ji et al. , 2004 , CNTF activation of the STAT3 pathway is also known to induce glial reactivity . Reactive glial changes are in turn implicated in the pathophysiology of numerous neurodegenerative diseases , including those of the retina Bringmann et al. , 2006 . Whether the changes in NTF expression and downstream signaling associated with OHT , and other retinal insults , represent aspects of pathology or physiological attempts to protect the local tissue remains unresolved . 4 . Neurotrophic factor delivery methods Given that NTF supply is important for neuronal survival during development and may be impaired in glaucoma , thereby poten-tially contributing to RGC loss , experimental protective strategies have aimed to supply exogenous NTFs to curb neurodegeneration . It is well documented that NTF supplementation enhances survival of cultured RGCs in vitro , however , here we will focus on the success of such approaches in experimental in vivo models of RGC neuro-degeneration . Fortunately , direct access to the retina is relatively straightforward and circumvents the need for systemic adminis-tration . This avoids formidable pharmacological challenges to NTF delivery to the CNS such as blood-brain-barrier transit and degra-dation in the circulation Webster and Pirrung , 2008 . Nonetheless , sustained delivery of NTFs to the retina presents its own challenges . 4.1 . Administration of purified protein The phenomenon of supplemented NTF protection of RGCs in OHT models of glaucoma was first demonstrated by studies that delivered purified BDNF via intraocular injection . This method of application required repeated intravitreal injections of BDNF to achieve an observable neuroprotective effect Ko et al. , 2000 , 2001 , with maximal protection derived after four injections which increased RGC survival from 73 % to 81 % of uninjured controls . Interestingly , the maximal effective dose of BDNF was found to be less than 5 mg per injection Ko et al. , 2000 , possibly due to a ceiling effect above which negative feedback-mediated down-regulation of TrkB attenuated BDNF neuroprotection Frank et al. , 1996 Chen and Weber , 2004 . Injection of recombinant CNTF is also neuroprotective in glau-coma . In rats with IOP elevated to roughly 1.5 times normal levels , a single intravitreal injection of 2 mg CNTF reduced RGC loss from approximately 22 % e5 % after four weeks Ji et al. , 2004 . This effect correlated with activation of STAT3 in cells within the RGC layer and the inner nuclear layer . Importantly , it should be noted that CNTF impairs retinal electrophysiology when administered at very high doses McGill et al. , 2007 , therefore therapeutic doses of this particular NTF are limited . While short-term beneficial effects have been demonstrated in some cases for single intraocular administrations of NTFs , long-term neuroprotection in glaucoma patients will likely require sus-tained NTF supply . It is perhaps this problem of sustained delivery that has most seriously hampered clinical translation of NTF therapy for glaucoma . Although repeated intravitreal injections are routine in many retinal clinics , for example for administration of vascular endothelial growth factor antagonists to treat wet age-related macular degeneration , alternate less invasive routes of administration capable of stable long-term delivery are of great interest . As an alternative to repeated intraocular injections , at least one group has assessed a potential role for topical NTF administration in the treatment of glaucoma . After observing that elevated IOP reduces NGF expression in the optic nerve Sposato et al. , 2008 and in the visual cortex and lateral geniculate nucleus Sposato et al. , 2009 , Lambiase et al. 2009 tested the effects of NGF eye drops in a rat model of OHT . In this case , protein levels reaching the posterior chamber of the eye were not directly assessed and so bioavailability of NGF after topical administration remains unclear . Nonetheless , the authors found that topical administration of NGF 4 times daily for 7 weeks increased RGC layer cell density by approximately 37 % and concomitantly reduced TUNEL reactivity in the RGC layer . The authors went on to administer topical NGF to three human glaucoma patients for a period of three months and reported improvements in inner retinal function , as assessed by pattern electroretinography , visual evoked potential , and in the visual field . It must be noted , however , that the authors assessed only a small number of patients with severe disease and did not include a control group . Thus , it remains undetermined whether the changes in visual function seen in this study were greater than what would be expected with placebo . A controlled clinical trial is required to determine whether topical NGF administration may be a viable neuroprotective treatment option for glaucoma . 4.2 . Slow release of protein from microreservoirs Delivery of NTFs over time might be sustained by implantation of a slow-release device loaded with a given factor s . One such application that has been tested in models of glaucoma is biode-gradable microspheres commonly made of poly-DL-lactide-cogly-colide PLGA . PLGA can be mixed with bioactive molecules during manufacture and subsequent degradation of the material in vivo results in slow , sustained NTF release . Ward et al. 2007 intra-vitreally transplanted microspheres infused with GDNF into DBA 2J mice , which exhibit a form of chronic secondary glaucoma that accelerates at about 8 months of age . In this scenario , multiple injections of microspheres 3e4 injections spaced 2e3 months apart significantly increased RGC survival up to 15 months of age . The same group Jiang et al. , 2007 have also shown that GDNF microspheres remain in the vitreous cavity 30 days after injection in a rat model of induced OHT , with improved RGC axon and soma survival 8 weeks after initial IOP elevation . While slow-release devices may prolong the interval between treatments , they are unlikely to eliminate the need for re-treat-ment , as only a finite amount of NTF can be delivered each time . Nonetheless , the benefits of this approach include pharmacokinetic control over the amount and duration of factor released , along with highly reproducible fabrication at relatively low cost . Numerous types of slow-release devices are FDA approved or in clinical trials for various applications , including slow release of drugs into the vitreous cavity for the treatment of macular edema Kuppermann et al. , 2007 Mansoor et al. , 2009 , posterior segment uveitis , Jaffe et al. , 2006 or CMV retinitis Bourges et al. , 2006 . Success of these devices may lead to permutations that can be used to deliver NTFs for glaucoma . 4.3 . Gene therapy The concept of gene therapy could be applied to NTF supple-mentation for glaucoma in order to overcome the problem of sus-tained delivery . By using viral vectors to increase endogenous retinal production of select NTF s , it may be possible to ameliorate RGC degeneration over the long term . For example , adenovirus AV has been utilized to induce M�ller glial over-expression of BDNF in a rat model of optic nerve transection Di Polo et al. , 1998 . This study found that BDNF over-expression increased RGC survival approximately 4.5 fold at 16 days post lesion . This effect was tran-sient and prolonging production of BDNF to 30 days with immune suppression to improve viral efficacy did not further enhance survival . Another approach used an AV vector to deliver GDNF to the retina prior to optic nerve transection and observed a 1.25 fold increase in RGC survival at 14 days post lesion Schmeer et al. , 2002 . However , the efficacy of AV-mediated gene transfer is limited by its relatively short duration of expression and by the fact that AV triggers significant inflammatory reactions . We used an alternative vector , adeno-associated virus AAV , to transduce retinal cells in the laser-induced OHT model of glaucoma Martin et al. , 2003 . By incorporating a cytomegalovirus CMV promoter , chicken b-actin enhancer , and the woodchuck hepatitis post-tran-scriptional regulatory element WPRE driving the BDNF gene in an AAV-2 vector , we were able to efficiently transduce more than 70,000 cells within the RGC layer per eye . This represented an upper limit of about 75 % RGC transduction following a single injection . With this treatment , BDNF gene therapy reduced RGC axon loss in the optic nerve from 52.3 % to 32.3 % relative to uninjured contra-lateral eyes four weeks after the onset of experimental glaucoma . Similarly , the effect of CNTF gene therapy in the laser-induced OHT model of glaucoma was investigated by Pease et al. 2009 . Using a vector similar to that described above , but lacking the WPRE , the authors were able to triple CNTF expression within the retina . This resulted in a decrease in RGC axon loss from 53.9 % to 39.7 % relative to uninjured contralateral eyes four weeks after the onset of OHT . Interestingly , co-administration of CNTF and BDNF vectors did not improve RGC survival , possibly because this combination reduced the transduction efficiency of CNTF compared to administration of that vector alone . The translational prospects for AAV-mediated gene therapy in glaucoma are good considering that clinical trials using similar vectors to treat Leber�s Congenital Amaurosis have so far proved to be safe and the injections have been well tolerated Bainbridge et al. , 2008 Maguire et al. , 2008 , 2009 Simonelli et al. , 2010 . Furthermore , recent advances in recombinant AAV engineering have led to the development of vectors that are less susceptible to ubiquitin-mediated degradation Petrs-Silva et al. , 2009 . This results in greater vector stability and significantly stronger retinal expression . Furthermore , expression has been targeted to RGCs using AAV serotype 8 and 9 vectors , which was previously only accomplished with AAV-2 . Application of more appropriate sero-types could increase viral transduction efficacy to permit use of lower doses , thus enhancing prospective clinical protocols . None-theless , genetic manipulation of endogenous cells with viral transduction may always represent a potential safety issue and will require careful testing prior to clinical translation . 4.4 . Cell transplantation therapy Recent studies have demonstrated that a wide variety of stem progenitor cells possess neuroprotective properties when thera-peutically transplanted in retinal disease models , including those for glaucoma Bull et al. , 2008 . It is thought that cell trans-plantation-mediated neuroprotection is frequently conferred via the production and secretion of NTFs Bull et al. , 2008 . In light of this , cell transplantation therapy is attractive because grafted cells could conceivably produce and secrete NTFs locally for the life of a patient , without the need for repeated applications or to geneti-cally alter endogenous cells . We have shown that intravitreal transplantation of inflamma-tory-stimulated oligodendrocyte precursor cells OPCs , a type of neural stem cell , can protect RGCs in experimental glaucoma Bull et al. , 2009 . In this study , OPC transplantation resulted in a reduction in RGC optic nerve axon loss from 60.3 % to 28.3 % . Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem stromal cells MSCs have been utilized extensively in neuroprotection research as these cells have been shown , in vitro , to produce and secrete a battery of NTFs including BDNF , CNTF , GDNF , and others Li et al. , 2002 , 2009 Ye et al. , 2005 Crigler et al. , 2006 Yu et al. , 2006a Arnhold et al. , 2007 Inoue et al. , 2007 Wilkins et al. , 2009 Zwart et al. , 2009 . MSCs are also therapeutically attractive because they can be iso-lated and expanded from bone marrow aspirates of adult patients to facilitate autologous transplantation , thereby circumventing logistical , ethical and rejection issues associated with other stem cell sources . Intravitreal transplantation of MSCs into rats with OHT induced by episcleral vein cauterization Yu et al. , 2006a or laser photocoagulation of the trabecular meshwork Johnson et al. , 2010 has demonstrated significant RGC neuroprotection . For example , we recently showed that local MSC transplantation reduced RGC optic nerve axonal loss from 38.3 % to 10.7 % four weeks after glau-coma onset Johnson et al. , 2010 . While studies of MSC-mediated neuroprotection in other parts of the CNS suggest that cells deliv-ered intravenously �home� to sites of injury , for example in ischaemic and multiple sclerosis models Kassis et al. , 2008 Karp and Leng Teo , 2009 Kim et al. , 2010 , we observed no such homing ability and no neuroprotective benefit following systemic administration of MSCs in glaucoma Johnson et al. , 2010 . While stem cells secrete relatively high levels of NTFs , there has been great interest in genetically modifying these cell types to increase NTF production and delivery further . For example , viral transfection of MSCs has increased the secretion of targeted NTFs by more than 20-fold Kurozumi et al. , 2004 . Accordingly , trans-plantation of such NTF �enhanced� MSCs has demonstrated impressive neuroprotective efficacy in pre-clinical models of neurodegenerative conditions Kurozumi et al. , 2004 Ikeda et al. , 2005 Liu et al. , 2006 Sasaki et al. , 2009 . As viral transfection raises several important clinical safety issues , protocols are also being developed to modify culture conditions to increase endoge-nous MSC secretion of NTFs without introducing exogenous genetic material . For instance , Sadan et al. 2008 , 2009a , b have developed a method for culturing rat and human MSCs in a defined cocktail of growth factors and other substances that up-regulates MSC production and secretion of a variety of NTFs , including BDNF and GDNF , by several fold . They have also demonstrated that this approach delivers enhanced neuroprotective properties in numerous neurodegenerative models . Despite such promising results , there are some important caveats to cell transplantation for neuroprotection in glaucoma . These include immune rejection of transplanted cells limiting graft survival and the tumorigenic potential associated with trans-planting undifferentiated cells . However , as diffusible factors mediate much neuroprotection by engrafted cells it is possible that both of these problems could be circumvented by enclosing transplanted cells in semi-permeable capsules to isolate them from the retinal microenvironment . If necessary , an encapsulated cell device could be surgically removed . Accordingly , there is interest in using encapsulated cell technologies intravitreally to provide trophic support while providing protection from rejection and tumorigenicity . Recently the results of a phase-I clinical trial using immortalized human retinal pigmented epithelial cells genetically modified to over-express CNTF for the treatment of retinitis pig-mentosa RP were reported Sieving et al. , 2006 . While not powered to evaluate the efficacy of the procedure on treating RP , this report did suggest that the encapsulated cell transplant was safe , allowed survival of grafted cells for at least 6 months , and released CNTF in clinically therapeutic doses . A phase-II placebo-controlled clinical trial is currently under way investigating use of a similar encapsulated cell system in patients with atrophic macular degeneration ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier NCT00447954 . Success in these trials may suggest that a similar approach could be undertaken for the treatment of glaucoma . NTF signaling pathways are often subject to complex regulation , therefore simply increasing NTF levels does not always benefit neuronal survival . As previously discussed , in addition to promoting cell survival via TrkA , NGF can bind to p75 and trigger pro-apoptotic signals . In fact , it has been proposed that the lack of efficacy for NGF delivery in glaucoma might be due to over-acti-vation of p75 since administration of a selective TrkA agonist , instead of NGF , was highly neuroprotective in hypertensive rat eyes Shi et al. , 2007 . As such , engineering of receptor-specific ligands , with binding kinetics altered compared to naturally occurring NTFs , is being explored as a way to achieve higher levels of neuro-protection . Recently , the combination of NGF , or a selective TrkA agonist , with a p75 inhibitor was shown to convey strong RGC protection following optic nerve transection Lebrun-Julien et al. , 2009 . This study also suggested that the deleterious effects of p75 activation were primarily mediated by glial cells . p75 activation could also attenuate the beneficial effects of BDNF delivery and blocking p75 signaling appears to potentiate the effect of this growth factor as well . In rats with laser-induced OHT , co-administration of BDNF and a LINGO-1 fusion protein LINGO-1 is a signaling partner of p75 has been found to augment BDNF neuroprotection Fu et al. , 2009 . Interestingly , blocking LINGO-1 without concomitant BNDF application was also neuroprotective in this model Fu et al. , 2008 . Alternatively , novel ligands which activate TrkB but not p75 might be of interest . A monoclonal anti-body which selectively activates TrkB has demonstrated RGC neu-roprotection following optic nerve transection Hu et al. , 2010 . In light of these results , it is possible that selectively activating multiple Trk receptors while blocking p75 using synthetic receptor ligands may produce a much more robust neuroprotective effect than delivery of traditional NTFs . Of course , such compounds would be subject to the same considerations concerning sustained delivery to the retina as their naturally occurring counterparts . Instead of developing ligands with greater specificity for pro-survival NTF receptors , it may be advantageous to circumvent receptor activation by promoting downstream pro-survival path-ways directly . Added benefits of this approach include the possi-bility of activating pathways common to multiple NTFs at once and bypassing complications associated with altered receptor expres-sion induced by glaucoma . For example , Zhou et al. 2005 used AAV to transduce RGCs with a constitutively activated form of MEK1 , an upstream activator of Erk1 2 , which is a member of the pro-survival MAPK pathway that is common to many NTFs Fig. 1 . This treatment increased RGC soma survival from 41 % to 61 % at five weeks , and from 23 % to 37 % at seven weeks , after the onset of OHT in a rat model of glaucoma . Conversely , suppression of downstream pro-apoptotic pathways may also provide an avenue for RGC neu-roprotection . Indeed , DBA 2J mice deficient in or completely lack-ing the Bax gene exhibited a lower degree of RGC soma death compared to control DBA 2J mice , although while RGC axon degeneration was slowed it was not prevented Libby et al. , 2005 . In addition , intraocular administration of caspase inhibitors has been shown to attenuate RGC death following optic nerve axotomy Chaudhary et al. , 1999 . Numerous systemically-administered compounds have also been suggested to activate pro-survival pathways , or suppress pro-apoptotic pathways , downstream of NTFs and might be considered for neuroprotective therapy in glaucoma . Continued research aimed at understanding these pathways in greater detail could be key to providing sustained neuroprotection in the context of altered NTF receptor expression and upstream signaling . 4.6 . Neurotrophic factors and optic nerve regeneration While neuroprotection may more effectively slow or halt glau-comatous vision loss , regeneration of RGC axons could instead provide a way to restore vision that has been lost . Optic nerve regeneration represents an extensive field that has been reviewed in detail elsewhere Benowitz and Yin , 2007 , 2008 Bull and Martin , 2007 Berry et al. , 2008 , however it is worth noting here that NTF administration may be applicable to RGC axon regeneration , in addition to having a role in neuroprotection . Besides influencing cell survival and apoptosis pathways , NTF signaling interacts with pathways involved in cytoskeletal rearrangement , growth cone stability , and axon elongation . However , as discussed previously in the context of neuroprotection , it should be noted that NTF signaling is complex and can produce both positive and negative effects on axon regeneration , which is dependent upon receptor expression and other upstream signals . 4.7 . Limitations and combinatorial approaches As evidence suggests that the expression levels and activity of several NTFs are disrupted in glaucoma , it is unlikely that treatment with a single NTF will optimally ameliorate the disease process . Instead , it is possible that combination therapies utilizing multiple NTFs will be more beneficial . However , as observed by Pease et al. 2009 , combined administration of NTFs is unlikely to enhance neuroprotection if the method used reduces delivery efficiencies compared to single factor administration . Another potential limi-tation of NTF delivery is suggested by the observation that main-taining NTF supply by repeated injection Ko et al. , 2000 or viral transduction Di Polo et al. , 1998 Schmeer et al. , 2002 reveals a ceiling effect for RGC protection . While this may be specific to the acute axotomy models employed by these studies , this ceiling effect might be caused by altered expression of NTF receptors by RGCs due to injury or via negative feedback mechanisms Frank et al. , 1996 Chen and Weber , 2004 . This implies that there might be a maximum potential benefit attainable from NTF delivery alone . Further research into the regulation of NTF receptors and their pathway components in RGCs could inform new methods to modulate NTF signaling . Given additional degenerative processes , including oxidative stress Mozaffarieh et al. , 2008 , inflammation Wax and Tezel , 2009 , mitochondrial dysfunction Kong et al. , 2009 , and excito-toxicity Seki and Lipton , 2008 , have been implicated in glau-comatous pathophysiology , combinatorial treatments that provide trophic support and also regulate alternative neurodegenerative pathways may prove highly effective . In support of this , Ko et al. 2000 demonstrated that BDNF treatment combined with free radical scavenging was more effective at slowing RGC loss in a rat model of glaucoma than BDNF treatment alone . Of course , any neuroprotective therapy for glaucoma should be adjunctive to IOP reduction , as this is the only clinically proven treatment for glau-coma Collaborative-Normal-Tension-Glaucoma-Study-Group , 1998 Kass et al. , 2002 . Such an approach is exemplified by Shi et al. 2007 who combined beta-blocker therapy with applica-tion of a TrkA agonist to effectively halt RGC loss from 2 to 4 weeks after initial experimental IOP elevation . 5 . Conclusions Published evidence suggests that NTF deprivation and dysfunction may play an important role in the pathophysiology of glaucoma . The observations that elevated IOP blocks retrograde transport of BDNF and that delivering BDNF directly to the retina can be neuroprotective support this hypothesis . However , dysre-gulation of other NTFs , as well as NTF receptors and signaling pathway components in the retina , should not be forgotten . The notion that RGC loss might be attenuated by NTF supplementation is supported by numerous pre-clinical studies that demonstrate neuroprotection in models of OHT glaucoma and mechanical optic nerve injury . In addition , alternative molecules with high affinity for certain NTF receptors may prove to be more effective neuro-protective agents than NTFs themselves , and should be further investigated . However , developing methods of sustained , safe delivery of biologically active NTFs at therapeutic levels to RGCs in vivo is a major stumbling point for the clinical translation of this potential therapy . The most promising delivery strategies appear to involve intraocular implantation of slow-release devices loaded with NTFs , gene therapy to enhance endogenous retinal production of NTFs , or intraocular transplantation of NTF-secreting cells encapsulated or otherwise . While safety issues need to be addressed for all of these approaches , variations are already being clinically applied to other diseases of the retina . Success of clinical trials in other diseases strengthens the case for using similar approaches in glaucoma . While much work remains before NTF-based therapies are delivered to the glaucoma clinic , such an adjunctive treatment is sorely needed for patients who continue to go blind despite application of the best currently available ocular hypotensive therapies .

20689555	The p53 tumor suppressor protein is a transcription factor that prevents damaged cells to proliferate in response to various cellular stresses.1�3 However , the ways by which p53 determines the cell fate outcome remain elusive.4 So far , the best described mechanism is its ability to modulate gene expression by binding directly and specifically to p53 responsive elements p53REs on DNA.5 We previously established that the human p53 gene expresses nine p53 protein isoforms p53 , p53b , p53g , D40p53a , D40p53b , D40p53g , D133p53a , D133p53b and D133p53g because of alternative splicing , alternative initiation of translation at codon 40 and alternative internal promoter . The D133p53a , D133p53b and D133p53g isoforms are N-terminally truncated p53 protein isoform deleted of the first 132 aa , of which mRNA is initiated from the internal promoter in intron-4 of the human p53 gene.6,7 p53 isoforms are expressed in normal human tissues and in tumors.8�15 We have previously shown that ectopically expressed D133p53a negatively regulates p53 tumor suppressor activity by inhibiting p53-mediated apoptosis.6 However , little is known about the molecular mechanisms by which human D133p53a modulates p53 activities at physiological level . In this study , we investigated the regulation of D133p53a expression and its physiological role in modulating the cellular response to DNA damage . We determined that endogenous D133p53a does not exclusively function in a dominant-negative manner toward p53 to regulate gene expression . Results Mapping of the p53 internal promoter within intron-4 of the human p53 gene . In the p53 homologous genes , p63 and p73 , DN isoforms are transcribed from an internal promoter P2 , located within intron-3 of both genes.15 We previously established that human p53 gene contains an internal promoter located in the intron-4.6 To map the transcription initiation site of p53 internal promoter 1555 bp upstream of exon-5 of the human p53 gene , we generated different luciferase reporter constructs Figure 1A , which were transfected into p53-null H1299 cells . As shown in Figure 1B , the 1555 bp fragment pi3i4luc a contains a promoter activity . Its activity is similar to the basal promoter activity of Bax and is approximately four times greater than the basal activity of the promoterless pGL3-basic plasmid . Deletion of residues 1�1304 Figure 1A , constructs c , d and f did not abolish the promoter activity Figure 1B , c , d and f , suggesting that the minimum p53 internal promoter region is located within the last 251 bp of the intron-4 Figure 1A , f . Moreover , the minimum p53 internal promoter Figure 1B , f showed a significant increase in the basal promoter activity fourfold , as compared with the basal activity of the pi3i4-luc construct Figure 1B , a , suggesting that the region 1�1304 bp contains negative regulatory elements such as silencers . In fact , the basal promoter activity of the construct f 1304�1555 is increased by threefold compared with the basal promoter activity of the construct d 1042�1555 , suggesting that the region 1042�1304 contains a silencer element . Deletion of the last 251 bp from the 30 end of intron-4 Figure 1A , constructs b and e completely abolishes the promoter activity Figure 1B , b and e , confirming that the initiation site of the p53 internal promoter is located within the last 250 bp of intron-4 of the human p53 gene . bioinformatic software and our refined consensus p53RE , 16 we identified a cluster of five p53 consensus decamers at the junction of exon-4 and intron-4 of the human p53 gene corresponding to the residues 757�804 in the pi3i4-luc construct Figure 2A , dashed box . To determine whether p53 directly transactivates its own internal promoter , deletion constructs c and d Figure 1A were assessed for their responsiveness to p53 Figure 2A , c and d , respectively . A luciferase construct driven by the p21 promoter was used as a positive control . As shown in Figure 2B , p53 induced the luciferase activity in all constructs containing the putative p53RE Figure 2A , a and c . Interestingly , the greatest induction sixfold was obtained with the construct containing the 723�1555 bp fragment Figure 2A , construct c , which contains all five decamers , but lacks the upstream 722 bp region of the p53 internal promoter . This suggests that the region 1�722 contains Human D133p53 is a direct p53 target gene . Using our several negative regulatory elements . Interestingly , deletion of the five putative decamers Figure 2A , construct d resulted in a significant decrease in p53 responsiveness Figure 2B , d compared with c without abolishing it , suggesting that p53 can induce p53 internal promoter through other transcription factors . Bioinformatics analysis revealed that the p53 internal promoter could be regulated by other transcription factors , including AP1 , elk-1 , N-myc , E2F , HIF-1a , HSF1 and ER Supplementary Figure A . To further confirm that the p53RE is functional , four single base mutations were generated by site-directed mutagenesis within the first two decamers of the internal promoter . As shown in Figure 2C , the four mutations are sufficient to significantly decrease p53 transactivation of the entire p53 internal promoter construct a . This result clearly demon-strates that intron-4 of the p53 gene contains a functional p53RE . However , these mutations do not completely abolish p53 activation probably because of the presence of the remaining decamers . Further analysis will be required to establish whether the remaining decamers can confer responsiveness to p53 . Endogenous p53 can directly bind to and transactivate its internal promoter . We next investigated whether 4 4i a c d endogenous p53 could directly bind to and transactivate its own internal promoter . MCF7 cells WTp53 were left untreated or treated with 60 ng ml of actinomycin D Act D for 2 h and a chromatin immunoprecipitation ChIP assay was performed . The immunoprecipitated DNA was quantified by RT-qPCR Figure 3a . A probe and primers specific for a 1 Fold region within the GAPDH gene that is not bound by p53 , was used as a negative control . The binding of p53 to the p21 promoter was analyzed as a positive control Supplementary Figure B1 . We further quantified the genomic DNA co-immunoprecipitated with p53 protein and containing either the p53RE intron-4 or exon-8 of the p53 gene . In unstressed cells Figure 3a , no significant binding of p53 to either intron-4 or exon-8 was observed . However , following Act D treatment , endogenous p53 was bound to intron-4 , but not to exon-8 , demonstrating that p53 binds to its own internal promoter . RT-qPCR experiments were carried out in MCF7 and MCF7-DDp53 devoid of functional p53 cells , to determine whether there is a p53-dependent induction of D133p53 mRNAs in response to Act D. Figure 3b . We designed a probe and primers from the unique 50UTR region of D133p53 mRNAs , encoding D133p53a , D133p53b and D133p53g , to quantify the transcriptional activity of the p53 internal promoter . p21 mRNA expression was determined as a positive control Supplementary Figure B2 . In Figure 3b , the expression of D133p53 mRNAs is significantly induced 2 h following Act D treatment in MCF-7 cells , but no induction of D133p53 mRNAs was seen in MCF7-DDp53 cells , confirming that the induction of D133p53 mRNAs is p53-dependent . To assess D133p53 mRNAs induction in other cell lines , we compared the expression of D133p53 mRNAs in response to doxorubicin treatment in colorectal carcinoma cell lines , expressing WTp53 HCT116 ? ? or devoid of full-length p53 FLp53 expression HCT116 . In HCT116 cells , the neomycin gene has been integrated within exon-2 of the p53 gene , resulting in the loss of FLp53 expression.17 However , HCT116 cells still express p53 isoforms at the mRNA and protein levels D40p53 and D133p53 iso-forms .7,18 We show here that D133p53 mRNAs are inducible in response to doxorubicin only in HCT116 ? ? , but not in HCT116 cells Figure 3c . Similar results were obtained in response to etoposide treatment data not shown . We further determined that D133p53 mRNAs is significantly induced on doxorubicin treatment in U2OS osteosarcoma cell line WTp53 and primary normal human dermal fibroblasts NHDF Figure 3d and e , respectively . Altogether , these results demonstrate that in vivo , the p53 internal promoter located within intron-4 , is directly transactivated by p53 in response to DNA damage in multiple cell lines . D133p53a protein expression is induced by p53 in response to DNA damage . Western blot analyses were performed to determine whether the increase of D133p53a protein is associated with the expression of D133p53 mRNAs . The rabbit polyclonal antibody CM1 can detect all p53 protein isoforms , including D133p53a . We thus analyzed D133p53a protein expression in HCT116 ? ? and HCT116 cells , treated or not with doxorubicin . To prevent any in vitro protein degradation , cells were directly lyzed in SDS-Laemmli buffer . Upon doxorubicin treatment , HCT116 ? ? cells induces p53 and some p53 isoforms migrating at 48 , 45 and 35 kDa Figure 4a . In HCT116 cells , a strong expression of D40p53 was detected , but neither D40p53 nor other p53 isoforms were induced in response to doxorubicin treatment . To identify the bands corresponding to D133p53a , we designed two distinct small interfering RNAs siRNAs si133a and si133b , which specifically target the 50UTR of D133p53 mRNA variants . Having confirmed the specificity and efficiency of si133a or si133b Supplementary Figure C1 , we transfected HCT116 cells with si133a , si133b or non-specific siRNA siNS as a negative control Figure 4b . Doxorubicin treatment induced the expression of p53 and also of some p53 isoforms migrating at 48 , 45 and 35 kDa Figure 4b lane 5 compared with 1 . The two D133p53 siRNAs , si133a and si133b , did not alter the level of endogenous p53 or of the other p53 isoforms corresponding to the bands at 48 and 45 kDa , but specifically reduced the expression of the 35 kDa band Figure 4b , lanes 4 , 6 compared with 5 , indicating that the 35 kDa band corresponds to endogenous D133p53a protein . The induction of D133p53a protein was further confirmed by western blot analysis in primary NHDF treated with doxo-rubicin Figure 4c . Altogether , these results demonstrate that in the cancer derived cell lines HCT116 WTp53 and in the normal primary fibroblasts , D133p53a isoform is induced by p53 at both mRNA and protein levels in response to DNA damage . Generation and characterization of U2OS-ctrl and U2OS - D133p53 cells . To determine the role of D133p53a in the cellular response to DNA damage , we investigated using bromodeoxyuridine BrdU cell cycle analysis and apoptosis assay annexinV assay , the experimental conditions that trigger cell cycle arrest , but not apoptosis of U2OS cells in response to doxorubicin . We established that U2OS cells grown for 24 h at 50 % confluence and treated with a low dose of doxorubicin 0.5 mM for 1 h , trigger G2 cell cycle arrest without promoting apoptosis 24 h after treatment . Those experimental conditions were then used in all the following experiments . Two cellular models were generated to define the biological relevance of D133p53a induction in response to DNA damage . U2OS cells were stably transfected with the empty pcDNA3 or pcDNA3-D133p53a expression vectors , to gen-erate U2OS-ctrl and U2OS-D133p53 cells , respectively . First , we analyzed ectopic D133p53a protein expression in U2OS-D133p53 cells by western blot analysis , using the CM1 antibody Figure 5A . U2OS-D133p53 cells transfected with si133a , si133b or siNS were left untreated or treated with doxorubicin 0.5 mM , 1 h . As shown in Figure 5A , lane 1 , ectopic D133p53a protein was expressed at 35 kDa . A weaker band at 32 kDa could also be detected and may correspond to a post-translationally modified form of D133p53a . Transfec-tion of U2OS-D133p53 cells with si133a or si133b specifically knock down the bands at 35 and 32 kDa corresponding to ectopic D133p53a protein , without affecting p53 protein level Figure 5A , lanes 2 , 3 compared with 1 . In U2OS-D133p53 cells , doxorubicin treatment induced p53 protein expression , but had no detectable effect on D133p53a protein level Figure 5A , lane 4 compared with 1 . This is because the ectopic expression of D133p53a , driven by the CMV promoter pcDNA3 plasmid , is exceeding the endogenous expression level and therefore masks the induction of endogenous D133p53a Figure 5B lane 1 compared with 7 . Depletion of D133p53a by si133a or si133b was equally efficient in doxorubicin-treated and untreated U2OS-D133p53 cells Figure 5A , lanes 2 , 3 compared with 1 and lanes 5 , 6 compared with 4 . The induction of p53 in response to doxorubicin is comparable in U2OS-D133p53 cells trans-fected with si133a , si133b or siNS Figure 5A , lanes 5 , 6 compared with 4 . Therefore , p53 can be induced in U2OS-D133p53 cells in response to doxorubicin treatment . To compare the expression level of D133p53a protein in U2OS-ctrl and U2OS-D133p53 cells , the same amount of protein from U2OS-D133p53 cells was loaded in Figure 5A , lane 1 and in Figure 5B , lane 1 . Endogenous D133p53a protein was not detectable in untreated U2OS-ctrl cells Figure 5B , lanes 2 and 3 . Transfection of si133a or si133b did not affect the expression of p53 in untreated U2OS-ctrl cells Figure 5B , lanes 4 and 5 . In response to doxorubicin 0.5 mM , 1 h , endogenous D133p53a was induced in U2OS-ctrl cells Figure 5B , lane 3 compared with 7 . It is noteworthy that in U2OS-ctrl cells treated with doxorubicin , endogenous D133p53a protein is induced , but is far less expressed than ectopic D133p53a protein in U2OS-D133p53 cells Figure 5B lane 7 compared with 1 . Transfection of U2OS-ctrl cells with si133a or si133b inhibited the induction of endogenous D133p53a protein in response to doxorubicin Figure 5B , lanes 8 , 9 compared with 7 . To determine whether the induction of D133p53a in doxorubicin-treated U2OS-ctrl cells is p53-dependent , cells were transfected with siTA , an siRNA that specifically targets p53 mRNAs containing exon-2 of the p53 gene without targeting D133p53 mRNAs . The results show that D133p53a protein induction is inhibited in doxor-ubicin-treated U2OS-ctrl cells depleted of p53 expression , confirming that D133p53a is induced by p53 Figure 5B , lane 6 compared with 7 . Human D133p53a antagonizes p53-mediated apoptosis and G1 cell cycle arrest without preventing G2 cell cycle arrest . We next investigated whether the cellular response to DNA damage could be regulated by modulating D133p53a expression . U2OS-ctrl and U2OS-D133p53 cells were transfected with si133a , si133b or siNS and were left untreated or treated with doxorubicin 0.5 mM , 1 h for 24 h . In parallel to the western blots presented in Figure 5A and B , cell cycle progression Figure 5C�E and apoptosis Figure 5F were also analyzed using BrdU assay and Annexin-V assay , respectively . A representative BrdU experiment is shown in Figure 5C . Untreated U2OS-ctrl and U2OS-D133p53 cells transfected with siNS showed similar cell cycle progression and a low percentage of spontaneous apoptosis 8 % , indicating that overexpression of D133p53a does not alter cell cycle progression and apoptosis in untreated cells Figure 5C-a , C-b , D , E and F . U2OS-ctrl and U2OS-D133p53 cells transfected with siNS and treated with a low dose of doxorubicin show statistically similar cell cycle progression with about 3 % of cells arrested in G1 and 79 % of cells arrested in G2 Figure 5C-c , C-d and E . In both cell lines , the low dose of doxorubicin did not significantly increase apoptosis compared with untreated cells Figure 5F . Altogether , this indicates that overexpres-sion of D133p53a in U2OS-D133p53 cells does not alter the cellular response to a low dose of doxorubicin , compared with U2OS-ctrl cells Figure 5C-c , C-d , D , E and F . U2OS-ctrl cells were transfected with siTA , we detected a statistically significant decrease in the percentage of cells arrested in G2 Figure 5E and in the percentage of apoptotic cells , compared with doxorubicin-treated U2OS-ctrl cells trans-fected with siNS Figure 5F . This is consistent with previous publications reporting that doxorubicin induces G2 cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in a p53-dependent manner in U2OS cells.19 As we have previously reported that overexpression of D133p53a can function in a dominant negative manner toward p53,6,7 it is surprising that the overexpression of D133p53a in U2OS-D133p53 cells does not inhibit p53-mediated G2 arrest . It implies that D133p53a does not exclusively function in a dominant-negative manner toward p53 . Strikingly , in response to doxorubicin treatment , depletion of the D133p53 isoforms with si133a or si133b significantly enhanced the percentage of U2OS-ctrl cells in G1 arrest 16 and 26 % , respectively , Figure 5C-e and D , suggesting that endogenous D133p53a inhibits G1 cell cycle arrest in U2OS-ctrl cells . To confirm this , U2OS cells overexpressing D133p53a U2OS-D133p53 were transfected with si133a or si133b . Although both siRNAs inhibit D133p53a expression in U2OS-D133p53 cells , D133p53a protein level was still over-expressed compared with endogenous D133p53a protein level in U2OS-ctrl cells Figure 5A . Transfection of si133a or si133b in U2OS-D133p53 does not significantly change the percentage of cells in G1 in response to treatment Figure 5C-f and D , confirming that si133a and si133b are specific and that D133p53a inhibits G1 arrest in U2OS-ctrl cells . Regarding apoptosis Figure 5F , in U2OS-ctrl cells transfected with si133a or si133b and compared with cells transfected with siNS , a statistically significant increase in the percentage of apoptotic cells was detected , suggesting that a low dose of doxorubicin can trigger apoptosis if cells are depleted of D133p53a . Consistent with this , in U2OS-D133p53 cells transfected with si133a or si133b a statistically significant lower increase in the percentage of apoptotic cells was observed in response to treatment . This indicates that overexpression of D133p53a rescued the resistance to C a 103 U2OS-ctrl Antibody-FITC U2OS - ? ? 133p53 U2OS-ctrl 39 apoptosis in response to a low dose of doxorubicin confirming that endogenous D133p53a inhibits p53-mediated apoptosis in U2OS-ctrl cells . Altogether , our results show that in response to a low dose of doxorubicin , endogenous D133p53a antagonizes p53-mediated apoptosis and G1 arrest , without inhibiting p53-dependent G2 arrest . This indicates that D133p53a does not exclusively inactivate p53 . Moreover , it demonstrates that the cellular response to DNA damage could be regulated by modulating D133p53a expression . Human D133p53a can form a protein complex with p53 and can differentially regulate p21 , HDM2 and Bcl-2 expression in response to stress . We have previously reported that ectopic D133p53a can act in a dominant-negative manner toward p53.7 To explain the regulation of p53 activities by D133p53a , we investigated whether D133p53a could directly interact with p53 . Co-immunoprecipitation assays were carried out on p53-null H1299 cells transfected with D133p53a and or p53 , using the mouse monoclonal antibody DO-1 , recognizing FLp53 but not D133p53a . Immunoprecipitated proteins were then analyzed by western blot with the rabbit polyclonal antibody CM1 , recognizing FLp53 and D133p53a . The results clearly show that D133p53a can form a protein complex with p53 Figure 6a . We then studied whether endogenous D133p53a could regulate p53 target gene expression in response to DNA damage . In this study , we focused on a few p53 target genes p21 , HDM2 and Bcl-2 , implicated in cell cycle progression and apoptosis . p21 encodes a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor involved in G1 and G2 cell cycle arrest , 20 whereas HDM2 is an E3-ubiquitin ligase that regulates p53 protein degradation.21,22 Both p21 and HDM2 genes are directly transactivated by p53 in response to stress , whereas Bcl-2 is an anti-apoptotic gene repressed by p53.23,24 Their expression was determined using western blot analysis Figure 6b , using protein extracts from U2OS-ctrl cells analyzed in Figure 5B . RT-qPCR analysis was also performed in parallel Supplementary Figure D . Doxorubicin treatment induced the expression of p21 and HDM2 at the mRNA and protein levels , but had no effect on Bcl-2 expression Supplementary Figure D and Figure 6b lane 2 compared with 1 . Depletion of FLp53 by siTA after doxorubicin treatment strongly inhibited p21 and HDM2 at the mRNA and protein levels , without altering Bcl-2 expres-sion Supplementary Figure D and Figure 6b lane 5 compared with 2 . This confirms that in U2OS-ctrl cells , induction of p21 and HDM2 expression in response to a low dose of doxorubicin is p53-dependent , whereas it suggests that Bcl-2 expression in U2OS-ctrl cells is not p53-dependent . Then , we compared with siNS , the effect of D133p53a depletion by si133a or si133b on the expression of p21 , HDM2 and Bcl-2 , in cells treated with doxorubicin Supple-mentary Figure D and Figure 6b lanes 3 , 4 compared with 2 . Depletion of D133p53a significantly increased the expression of p21 mRNA , but did not alter p21 protein expression . Interestingly , D133p53a depletion reduced the expression of HDM2 and Bcl-2 at both protein and mRNA levels . This suggests that D133p53a can increase Bcl-2 expression and contributes to the induction of HDM2 expression , in response to treatment . Therefore , our results show that D133p53a can differentially regulate p21 , HDM2 and Bcl-2 expression and that D133p53a can directly interact with p53 . Altogether , we show that p53-mediated expression of D133p53a in response to a low dose of doxorubicin , leads to the inhibition of p53-mediated apoptosis and G1 cell cycle arrest , without inhibiting p53-mediated G2 cell cycle arrest . Moreover , we show that D133p53a can directly interact with p53 and can differentially regulate the expression of p21 , HDM2 and Bcl-2 in response to doxorubicin . This indicates that D133p53a does not exclusively inhibit p53 , but rather modulates p53 activities . Of note , we can not exclude that it can modulate gene expression independently of p53 . Discussion We have recently reported that the human p53 gene encodes nine different p53 isoforms , which can modulate p53 target gene expression , in a promoter-dependent manner.6 In this study , we investigated the regulation of p53�s internal promoter leading to D133p53a expression and the biological activities of endogenous D133p53a in response to a low dose of doxorubicin . We determined that the initiation site of the p53 internal promoter is located within the last 250 bp of intron-4 of the human p53 gene . Moreover , we identified a functional p53RE composed of five putative decamers at the junction of exon-4 and intron-4 . Further analysis will determine whether all five decamers can confer responsiveness to p53 , p63 and or p73 . By bioinformatics analysis , we determined that the p53 internal promoter could be responsive to cell proliferation signals AP1 , Elk1 , N-myc and E2F , hypoxia HIF-1a , heat shock HSF1 or hormones estrogen receptor . In addition , we identified a silencer region position 1042�1304 contain-ing response elements to the repressor ZNF219 and CBF1 . To date , it is not possible to specifically quantify the expression of each separate D133p53 isoform D133p53a , D133p53b and D133p53g , encoded from the p53 internal promoter . Hence , to quantify the mRNA level of the D133p53 isoforms , we designed primers and probe specific for the 50UTR of D133p53 mRNAs , absent in FLp53 mRNA . We showed that the human p53 internal promoter is induced in response to doxorubicin or Act D treatment in normal and in cancer cell lines expressing WTp53 , suggesting that the p53-mediated regulation of its own internal promoter is conserved through evolution.25 Consistently , the expression of D133p53 mRNAs is associated with an increase in D133p53a protein level only in normal cells and in cancer cell lines expressing WTp53 as determined by transfection of two distinct siRNAs si133a and si133b , specific for the D133p53 mRNA variants . The endogenous D133p53a protein corresponds to a band at 35 kDa . It is noteworthy that ectopic and endogenous D133p53a give a band at 35 kDa and a weaker band at 32 kDa , in U2OS cells . We assume that the band at 32 kDa corresponds to a post-translationally modified form of D133p53a . We have recently published that D113p53 , the zebrafish homolog of human D133p53a , prevents p53-mediated apop-tosis in response to embryonic defects or DNA damage25 and that human D133p53a can inhibit replicative senescence.14 We investigated whether the cellular response to DNA damage could be regulated by modulating D133p53a expres-sion . We determined that treatment of U2OS-ctrl cells with doxorubicin 0.5 mM , 1 h induces exclusively p53-dependent G2 cell cycle arrest without promoting G1 cell cycle arrest and p53-dependent apoptosis . Then , we established that depletion of D133p53 mRNAs by si133a or si133b changes the cellular response of U2OS cells treated with doxorubicin 0.5 mM , 1 h , increasing the proportion of cells undergoing apoptosis and G1 cell cycle arrest . Overexpression of D133p53a restores resistance to apoptosis and abolition of G1 cell cycle arrest without preventing p53-mediated G2 cell cycle arrest . The inhibition of p53-mediated apoptosis and G1 cell cycle arrest in response to D133p53a expression is consistent with our previous reports showing that D133p53a can function in a dominant-negative manner toward p53.6,7,14 The direct interaction of D133p53a with p53 is in support of this mechanism . However , as the overexpression of D133p53a did not inhibit p53-dependent G2 cell cycle arrest , it indicates that D133p53a does not exclusively act by inactivating p53 . Indeed , D133p53a represses p21 , whereas it induces Bcl-2 and HDM2 expression in response to doxorubicin , suggesting that many genes are differentially regulated by D133p53a to modulate cell fate outcome in response to DNA damage . Further experiments will determine whether it can regulate gene expression independently of p53 . Our findings may have profound significance to extend our understanding of the mechanisms , by which p53 exerts its tumor suppressor activity . They demonstrate a new feedback loop , in which p53-induced D133p53a functions to modulate the cellular response to DNA damage . Materials and Methods p53 internal promoter constructs . The p53 internal promoter , corresponding to the region 11 523�13 076 bp of the human p53 gene accession no . X54156 , NCBI , was generated by PCR using the primers p53RE-a fwd and p53RE-a rev Table 1 . The PCR fragment was first cloned into the pCR4-TOPO vector using the TOPO TA Cloning kit Invitrogen , Paisley , UK and was further subcloned into the pGL3-basic plasmid , upstream of the luciferase reporter gene , to generate the pi3i4-luc construct construct a in Figure 1A . Subsequently , a number of deletion constructs of pi3i4-luc b , c , d and e in Figure 1A were made by enzymatic digestion using various restriction enzymes , followed by religation and subcloning of the obtained fragments . Two other pi3i4-luc constructs constructs c and d in Figure 2A , with or without p53REs , were generated by PCR using the primers� combination p53RE-b fwd p53RE-a rev and p53RE-c fwd p53RE-a rev for constructs b and c , respectively Figure 2A and Table 1 . Site-directed mutagenesis of the identified p53REs was carried out by PCR on the pi3i4-luc , using the primers Mut-p53RE fwd and Mut-p53RE rev Table 1 . All generated constructs were verified by DNA sequencing . Dual luciferase assay . H1299 cells 3 104 were seeded in 24-well plates , 24 h before transfection .

For each well , 0.5 mg of each p53 internal promoter construct as indicated in the legends and 50 ng of the Renilla luciferase reporter plasmid were co-transfected with 200 ng of the FLp53 expression vector or with the pSI empty expression vector , used as negative control .

20691180	a r t i c l e i n f o Article history Keywords 1 . Introduction The possibility that mitochondrial dysfunction may contribute to the pathogenesis of glaucomatous neurodegeneration has been a slowly growing research undercurrent . Secondary involvement of mitochondria in retinal ganglion cell death consequent to chronic hypoperfusion , excitotoxicity , alterations in immune or glial compartments , or genetic factors has been well covered in recent reviews Kong et al. , 2009 Osborne , 2010 Ray and Mookherjee , 2009 Tezel , 2009 . The phenotypic similarities of glaucoma and the primary mitochondrial optic neuropathies have also long been noted , and are the subject of excellent reviews Carelli et al. , 2004 , 2009 Votruba , 2004 . Here we review evidence for primary and secondary impair-ments of mitochondria in human glaucoma and in cell and animal models . The special features of the retinal ganglion cell are considered , as are the main glaucoma risk factors of elevated intraocular pressure and older age , in relation to mitochondrial function . Exciting developments from mitochondrial biogenesis research are then considered in some detail , as new findings bring some optimism that new therapies aimed at improving mito-chondrial function may slow neuronal cell loss in glaucoma and other age-related neurodegenerative diseases . 2 . Glaucoma Glaucoma is a neurodegenerative disease of the optic nerve characterized by the accelerated death of retinal ganglion cells RGCs and their axons . The death of RGCs ultimately leads to progressive visual field loss and eventual blindness . Electrophysi-ological tests such as the electroretinogram ERG can to some extent discriminate inner RGC and outer photoreceptor retinal neuronal function , especially using the dark-adapted scotopic threshold response Bui and Fortune , 2004 . For clinical diagnosis a combination of pattern ERG and multifocal visual evoked potential mfVEP provide useful adjuncts Graham and Fortune , 2009 . Currently , an estimated 60.5 million people have glau-coma , and it is the second leading cause of blindness in the world Quigley and Broman , 2006 . One risk factor for developing glau-coma is increased intraocular pressure IOP and reducing IOP is used clinically as a therapeutic modality to slow glaucoma progression however controlling IOP does not prevent progression of disease in all patients . A second major risk factor for glaucoma is aging , where the prevalence and incidence of glaucoma increase exponentially with age , even after compensating for the increase in IOP with age Leske et al. , 2007 . This suggests that aging may increase the vulnerability of the optic nerve to various stressors , including IOP , ultimately resulting in RGC death and optic nerve degeneration . This age-related neuronal vulnerability to injury has also been observed in other neurodegenerative disorders , such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis , Alzheimer�s disease , and Parkinson�s disease . The optic nerve is structurally unique within the body and is used to transmit information from the retina at the back of the eye , to the visual cortex in the brain . The optic nerve consists of RGCs originating in the unmyelinated retinal nerve fiber layer which then travel through the vitreous toward the optic nerve head . At this point , the RGCs make a 90 degree turn , passing through a series of perforated collagen plates called the lamina cribrosa before form-ing the optic nerve . The optic nerve then becomes myelinated and continues onto the visual cortex . Mitochondria provide energy for the proper function of the optic nerve , which has one of the greatest energy demands in the body and one of the highest relative rates of oxygen consumption Raichle and Gusnard , 2002 Yu and Cringle , 2001 . Within the optic nerve , mitochondrial distribution is skewed mitochondrial density is higher in the unmyelinated regions in the retina than in the myelinated region Andrews et al. , 1999 Bristow et al. , 2002 Hollander et al. , 1995 Minckler et al. , 1977 Mutsaers and Carroll , 1998 . The mitochondrial density changes according to local energy demands . The unmyelinated prelaminar and laminar optic nerve regions require more energy to restore electric potential , and there is a high density of voltage gated Na ? channels in this area of the optic nerve Barron et al. , 2004 . Accordingly , mitochondria , as well as structural cytoskeleton proteins neurofilaments , MAP1 and actin are found in their highest concentrations in the unmyelin-ated portion of the nerve , with a significant decrease in concen-tration occurring more posteriorly with optic nerve myelination Balaratnasingam et al. , 2009 . This variability may predispose certain regions of the optic nerve with higher energy dependence , such as the unmyelinated prelaminar regions , to be more suscep-tible to changes in mitochondrial distribution and function . The distribution of mitochondria within the optic nerve relies on mitochondrial fission and fusion to determine morphology and density . Mitochondrial fission and fusion help maintain the mito-chondrial network , as mitochondria are organelles which branch and form connections to allow for respiratory complementation and mixing of mtDNA Attardi et al. , 2002 Inoue et al. , 2003 . A balance of fission and fusion events allows for optimal function and an ability to respond to changing metabolic needs by adjusting mitochondrial distribution within the cell Chen and Chan , 2006 . Key proteins in the fusion machinery include mitofusin 1 Mfn1 , mitofusin 2 Mfn2 , and OPA1 . Inhibition of fusion via Mfn1 , Mfn2 , or OPA1 leads to excessive fission , resulting in fragmentation of the mitochondrial network , which in turn can lead to loss of mtDNA , reduced respiration , and loss of transmembrane potential Chen and Chan , 2006 Yaffe , 1999 . Mutations in OPA1 are a frequent cause of Autosomal Dominant Optic Atrophy ADOA , a rare but important hereditary optic neuropathy discussed further below . Overexpression of pro-fusion protein Mfn2 results in mitochondrial fusion and increased respiration Chen et al. , 2005 . Thus , excessive fission may have detrimental effects on cell survival , with evidence showing that fragmentation sensitizes cells to injury Barsoum et al. , 2006 and excessive fission is also present at early stages during apoptosis Karbowski et al. , 2004 . On the contrary , promoting mitochondrial fusion might be protective against injury Chen et al. , 2007 Jahani-Asl et al. , 2007 . Mitochondrial dynamics and their resulting distribution are essential to maintaining function , and are therefore an important component of mitochondrial health , and in turn , cellular health . Dysfunction in mitochondrial fission , fusion , and biogenesis can result in various pathologies and can also contribute to problems with mtDNA , oxidative phosphorylation OXPHOS , and ATP production . These various facets of mitochondrial dysfunction are hypothesized to contribute to the RGC degeneration seen in glau-coma , as well as that of various inherited optic neuropathies , and are thus targets for potential therapeutic interventions . 4 . Evidence for mitochondrial dysfunction in glaucoma While the pathogenesis of glaucoma remains unknown , numerous studies suggest a potential link to mitochondrial dysfunction . POAG has been associated with mtDNA mutations , where screening of 27 POAG patients showed 17 patients had novel non-synonymous mtDNA changes most were transversions resulting in changes between purine and pyrimidine orientation Abu-Amero et al. , 2006 . There was also a decrease in the mean respiratory activity of 24 of the 27 POAG patients , indicating that oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction may be contrib-uting to the pathogenesis of POAG . Normal tension glaucoma NTG has been associated with a number of mutations in genes encoding mitochondrial proteins Mabuchi et al. , 2007 Wolf et al. , 2009 . Both types of glaucoma exhibit evidence of oxidative stress , mediated through the proteins of the mitochondrial electron transport chain Tezel , 2006 . Furthermore , the proposed mecha-nism of RGC death through apoptosis mirrors that of other optic neuropathies that are associated with mitochondrial abnormalities such as ADOA Calandrella et al. , 2007 Kerrigan et al. , 1997 . These data point to mitochondrial dysfunction playing a role in glaucoma pathogenesis and in particular , may have a primary role in the initial susceptibility to the development of glaucoma . 4.1 . Oxidative stress is a manifestation of mitochondrial dysfunction Oxidative stress is a common manifestation of mitochondrial dysfunction and has been repeatedly implicated in pathogenesis of glaucoma Tezel , 2006 . Reactive oxygen species ROS are major contributors to oxidative stress , and they include free radicals such as superoxide anion , hydroxyl radical , lipid radicals , and nitric oxide . The mitochondria are the main generators of ROS , which are produced primarily from electron leakage of Complex I and III of the oxidative phosphorylation OXPHOS pathway Cadenas and Davies , 2000 . Any inhibition of electron transport through OXPHOS pathway also enhances ROS production Barros et al. , 2004 Cadenas et al. , 1977 Kushnareva et al. , 2002 Turrens and Boveris , 1980 . ROS also play a positive role in cell signalling , but their uncontrolled production can lead to cell damage , necrosis , or apoptosis via oxidation of macromolecules such as proteins Butterfield et al. , 1997 Cakatay et al. , 2001 Munch et al. , 2000 , lipids Papaioannou et al. , 2001 nuclear DNA Sohal et al. , 1994 , and mitochondrial DNA Jarrett et al. , 2008 . Cells protect against these effects of ROS with antioxidant enzymes including super-oxide dismutase , catalase , and glutathione transferase together with small molecule antioxidants such as glutathione . There is extensive evidence supporting the role of oxidative stress in glaucoma . We will further explore the oxidative stress seen in glaucoma in the context of the increased IOP and age , as these two risk factors for glaucoma can both individually lead to increased states of oxidative stress . This link suggests that IOP and age may exert their influence on glaucoma pathogenesis through mitochondrial dysfunction . 5 . IOP in glaucoma pathogenesis Increased IOP is often seen in association with the optic nerve degeneration of glaucoma , and the loss of RGCs leads to loss of the neuroretinal rim visualized in the fundus of glaucoma patients . The increased IOP can cause an outward bowing and distortion of the lamina cribrosa , and it has been proposed that the initial damage to the axons of the RGCs occurs at the level of the lamina cribrosa Quigley et al. , 1983 . Despite the rodent eye lacking the lamina cribrosa , studies using the DBA 2J mouse model of glau-coma have supported this , showing early axonal damage being limited to the analogous region in the mouse eye just posterior to the retina Howell et al. , 2007 . The remodelling of these connective tissue plates in the human eye is mediated by activated glial cells which alternately can provide protective factors and destructive factors to the neurons . Mechanically , these changes have been shown to block axonal transport of neurotrophic factors Minckler et al. , 1977 Pease et al. , 2000 , which may impair the survival of ganglion cell neurons Quigley , 1999 . Mitochondria are the largest of cellular cargo transported via axonal transport , and have to be delivered to distant synaptic endings which have high metabolic needs . Any impairment of axonal transport secondary to mechan-ical stress is likely to impact on mitochondrial movement . The RGCs ultimately degenerate via an apoptotic process as demonstrated in rats Garcia-Valenzuela et al. , 1995 , primates Quigley et al. , 1995 , and glaucoma patients Kerrigan et al. , 1997 . The elevated IOP affects the degenerative process of RGCs via mechanisms other than mechanical stress . Increased pressure in the eye has been associated with oxidative stress , with oxidative stress markers 4-Hydroxy-2-nonenal HNE and heme-oxygenase OH-1 increasing with acute IOP increases in a mouse model Liu et al. , 2007 . Chronic IOP elevation in rats leads to increased retinal lipid peroxidation Moreno et al. , 2004 . In glaucoma patients , there are elevated serum levels of heat shock proteins and glutathione s-transferase GST , which are protective proteins whose presence indicate increased stress Tezel et al. , 1998 Yang et al. , 2001 . Rosario Hernandez pioneered identification of astrocytic changes in glaucoma . Her group showed that activated astrocytes respond to increased IOP with protective factors that reflect the oxidative nature of glaucomatous damage Hernandez et al. , 2002 . One way in which glial cells typically protect neurons is by synthesizing glutathione GSH and by providing precursors for GSH synthesis . The antioxidant effects of GSH protect the mito-chondrial electron transport chain from oxidative damage . The astrocytes in human glaucomatous optic nerve heads exhibit increased expression of glutamate cysteine ligase , the rate-limiting enzyme of synthesis of GSH Hernandez , 2000 . Additionally , glaucomatous astrocytes also show increased expression of super-oxide dismutase , which is responsible for catalysing the conversion of superoxide anion to O2 and H2O2 Agapova et al. , 2006 . Astro-cytes are the major cell type in the optic nerve head , and are likely to be important for trophic support of RGCs Hernandez , 2000 . Beyond trophic factor support , the astrocyte may be directly involved in fuelling neurons via �neuron-glia metabolic coupling� see Magistretti , 2006 for review . While controversial , this theory has considerable experimental support , and proposes that astro-cytes supply the majority of neuronal fuel by converting glucose to lactate via glycolysis upon neuronal stimulation , where the lactate is transferred to neurons , and converted to pyruvate for mito-chondrial oxidation . Perturbation of astrocytes in the glaucomatous optic nerve head may therefore indirectly impact on mitochondrial energy generation by limiting lactate supply . The oxidative stress associated with elevated IOP is likely generated as a result of mitochondrial dysfunction . Recent evidence shows that elevated IOP may have direct impact on mitochondria studies in mice subjected to ocular hypertension have shown COX reduction , mitochondrial fission , and cristae depletion Ju et al. , 2007 . In addition , increases in IOP were correlated with changes OPA1 expression and induction of OPA1 release Ju et al. , 2009 . These findings further substantiate a major role of mitochondrial dysfunction in pressure-related glaucomatous optic nerve degeneration . 6 . Aging in glaucoma pathogenesis The link between increased age and prevalence of glaucoma suggests that aging may lead to increased vulnerability of the optic nerve to various stressors , ultimately resulting in RGC death and optic nerve degeneration . Studies in rodent models have demon-strated that RGCs in elderly rats are more susceptible to optic nerve crush injury and ischemia-reperfusion injury Katano et al. , 2001 . This age-related neuronal vulnerability to injury has also been observed in other neurodegenerative disorders , such as amyo-trophic lateral sclerosis , Alzheimer�s disease , and Parkinson�s disease . While the exact mechanisms underlying the relationship between age and neuronal vulnerability have not been fully eluci-dated , increasing evidence suggests that an impaired capacity to handle oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction may play a key role in predisposing to neuronal cell death in age-related neurodegenerative diseases such as glaucoma Joseph et al. , 2000 Olanow , 1992 . Oxidative stress is a prominent feature of aging and the processes that lead to its development with increased age may also contribute to neurodegeneration in glaucoma . Aging is associated with oxidative modifications of proteins Butterfield et al. , 1997 Cakatay et al. , 2001 Munch et al. , 2000 , lipids Papaioannou et al. , 2001 , as well as nuclear DNA Sohal et al. , 1994 . Oxidative damage of mitochondrial DNA mtDNA in neurons of the brain has also been demonstrated Wang et al. , 2008 . The aging retina is also associated with increased expression of oxidative stress response genes Yoshida et al. , 2002 and free radical accumulation Leung et al. , 2008 . Increased oxidative stress also enhances the develop-ment of advanced glycation end products AGEs , which are protein products formed from extended exposure to reducing sugars as part of the physiological process of aging . However , advanced accumu-lation of AGEs is found in the glaucomatous ONH and retina and can exacerbate disease progression by forming protein aggregates that interfere with normal cellular functions and by generating ROS that further contributes to the state of oxidative stress . B-amyloid is another example of a pathological protein whose accumulation can lead to oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction Crouch et al. , 2007 it has also been implicated in neuron damage in the retina Guo et al. , 2007 . Thus , the oxidative damage associated with aging may not only be the result of mitochondrial dysfunction but may also play a causative role as well . Other manifestations of mitochondrial dysfunction in aging include a decline of mitochon-drial ATP production , OXPHOS activity , and reduction in mito-chondria number Trounce et al. , 1989 Wei et al. , 1998 . 7 . Mitochondrial optic neuropathies Mitochondrial dysfunction is emerging as a key component of optic nerve diseases , as mutations in nuclear and mitochondrial genes encoding mitochondrial proteins have been linked to a number of primary optic neuropathies Carelli et al. , 2004 , 2009 Votruba , 2004 . However , the functional consequence of these mutations remainspoorly understood , although common findings in the optic neuropathies include reduced oxidative phosphorylation , fragmentation of the mitochondrial network , as well as heightened sensitivity to apoptosis . Leber�s Hereditary Optic Neuropathy LHON , ADOA , and NTG are conditions with mitochondrial abnor-malities in which RGCs are selectively lost . A more generalised neuronal loss that includes retinal ganglion cell loss is found in mitochondrial diseases such as MELAS , MERRF , Friedreich�s Ataxia , Mohr-Tranebjaerg syndrome MTS , Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease subtype CMT2A , and other OXPHOS mutations . The common involvement of the visual pathway in these diseases supports the hypothesis that mitochondrial failure may act as a common patho-genic mechanism for RGC loss resulting in visual failure . Excellent detailed reviews have addressed mitochondrial dysfunction in optic neuropathies Carelli et al. , 2004 , 2009 so that here we very briefly summarize the main findings . 7.1 . Leber�s Hereditary Optic Neuropathy LHON is a mitochondrially inherited degeneration of retinal ganglion cells and their axons . LHON is the most common mito-chondrial DNA mtDNA inherited disease , and in over 90 % of cases , LHON is due to mutations in one of three mtDNA encoded OXPHOS complex I genes 11778 ND4 , 14484 ND6 and 3460 ND1 Carelli et al. , 2009 . These mutations lead to decreased complex I enzyme rates Brown et al. , 2000 , decreased complex I and complex II-linked ATP production and decreased transmembrane potential Korsten et al. , 2010 . Although the primary genetic determinant of LHON is point mutation in complex I , it has been hypothesized that there are other genetic determinants , including nuclear modifying genes that may dictate disease progression Bu and Rotter , 1991 , 1992 . Morphologically , the nerve fiber layer of the papillomacular bundle , a group of rapidly-firing RGCs serving central vision , has been documented to be swollen in the acute phase , potentially from a compensatory increase in the mitochon-drial number in the prelaminar area Barboni et al. , 2005 Savini et al. , 2005 . Clinically , RGC degeneration occurs primarily in the third and fourth decade in life and leads to the painless loss of vision in one eye , rapidly followed by loss of vision in the other eye , resulting in permanent severe loss of central vision . Spontaneous vision recovery may occur , most commonly with the 14484 mutation Brown et al. , 2001 . 7.2 . Autosomal Dominant Optic Atrophy ADOA Mitochondrial dysfunction occurs in ADOA , where there is a specific loss of RGCs . The resulting atrophy of the RGC layer in ADOA leads to moderate to severe loss of visual acuity with insidious onset in early childhood . There is considerable inter-and intra-familial variation in visual acuity Hoyt , 1980 Kline and Glaser , 1979 , indicating there may be other genetic modifiers that dictate disease progression . The majority of cases of ADOA have been linked to over 60 mutations see Ferre et al. 2005 for extensive lists in the nuclear-encoded mitochondrial protein OPA1 Alexander et al. , 2000 Cohn et al. , 2007 Delettre et al. , 2000 . The OPA1 protein is a dynamin-related GTPase targeted to the mitochondrial intermembrane space Delettre et al. , 2002 Olichon et al. , 2006 . Regulation of OPA1 is hypothesized to occur via alternative splicing Delettre et al. , 2001 Ferre et al. , 2005 into two long isoforms with mitochondrial pro-fusion roles , which can be cleaved into three short isoforms with a pro-fission and anti-apoptotic role Duvezin-Caubet et al. , 2006 Ishihara et al. , 2006 . OPA1 plays an important role in mitochon-drial inner membrane fusion by maintaining the cristae structure in the mitochondria Chen et al. , 2005 Cipolat et al. , 2004 Frezza et al. , 2006 Olichon et al. , 2003 and blocking cytochrome c release independent of mitochondrial fusion Frezza et al. , 2006 . OPA1 also sits in close proximity to the OXPHOS complexes in the mitochondrial inner membrane and has been shown to interact directly with complexes I , II and III , playing a role in their assembly and overall stability Zanna et al. , 2008 . Fibroblasts from ADOA patients show mitochondrial network fragmentation Amati-Bonneau et al. , 2008 Olichon et al. , 2007 , and fibroblast cultures carrying OPA1 mutations show complex I defects Hudson et al. , 2008 Mayorov et al. , 2008 , decreased cellular respiration Chevrollier et al. , 2008 and ATP production Amati-Bonneau et al. , 2005 Chevrollier et al. , 2008 Lodi et al. , 2004 Zanna et al. , 2008 . 7.3 . Optic nerve loss occurs with mitochondrial dysfunction There are similarities in pathological and molecular character-istics in both LHON and ADOA , wherein both diseases there is specific loss of RGCs linked to mitochondrial dysfunction , increased ROS production , and eventual cell death by apoptosis . Glaucoma may share pathogenic mechanisms with the mitochondrial optic neuropathies and glaucomatous optic nerves often have striking clinical similarities to ADOA Buono et al. , 2002 , as well as common molecular associations including a single nucleotide polymorphism of OPA1 , which is associated with NTG and not high tension glau-coma Aung et al. , 2002a , b , and Mabuchi et al. suggest that the OPA1 IVS 8 ? 32T C polymorphism may also influence phenotypic features in high tension glaucoma Mabuchi et al. , 2007 Powell et al. , 2003 . Examining both microarray and RT-PCR data has shown downregulation of the OPA1 gene in LHON cells with the 11778 mutation Abu-Amero et al. , 2009 . A large study of 285 German glaucoma patients also showed a trend toward association with SNPs in the genes encoding mitofusin 1 and mitofusin 2 MFN1 MFN2 and presenilin-associated rhomboid-like PARL protease Wolf et al. , 2009 . MFN1 MFN2 are nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteins that play a role in fusionefission events , and PARL is hypothesized to play a role in OPA1 processing both associations support the role of mitochondrial dysfunction in glaucoma . While there is a lack of evidence supporting classical inheritance patterns in NTG , gene array data Wolf et al. , 2009 suggests multigenic inheritance where multiple variants may contribute to glaucoma . With the close clinical similarity to ADOA and the association with various genes crucial to mitochondrial function , NTG may fall into the category of mitochondrial optic neuropathies and share common mechanisms of RGC loss via mitochondrial dysfunction . More broadly , we also see involvement of the optic nerve in other mitochondrial diseases including Friedreich�s Ataxia , Mohr-Tranebjaerg syndrome MTS , Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease CMT , and other OXPHOS mutation conditions including MELAS and MERRF . These are covered in depth by Carelli et al. 2009 . For the current review , we emphasize the very common involvement of retinal dysfunction in syndromic mitochondrial diseases . These disorders often have other severe and progressive neurological involvement , suggesting that the retina , and RGCs in particular , represent a particularly susceptible neuronal population to mito-chondrial energetic insufficiency . 8 . Mitochondria as a target for therapeutic intervention Understanding the molecular pathways involved in optic nerve degeneration will provide avenues for therapeutic intervention to bypass or decelerate RGC loss . A rational research pathway lies in manipulation of mitochondrial biogenesis aimed at bypassing mitochondrial impairment seen in many optic nerve diseases . Bioactive compounds that are reported to stimulate mitochondrial biogenesis are linked to many health benefits such as increased longevity , improved energy utilisation and protection from ROS. Key players in these pathways include PGC1a , NRF-1 2 and TFAM . Pharmacological agents that may be used to stimulate these pathways include sirtuin activators such as resveratrol , or PPAR agonists including the fibrates family to directly influence PGC1a Fig. 1 . Calorie restriction CR is a robust form of non-genetic manip-ulation to decelerate the aging process , extend life in mammals and reduce susceptibility to many age-related disease processes including cancer , cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases Bordone and Guarente , 2005 Guarente and Picard , 2005 Means et al. , 1993 . The beneficial effects of CR appear to be through improved mitochondrial function , namely increased mitochondrial respiration Nisoli et al. , 2005 and biogenesis Lopez-Lluch et al. , 2006 Miwa et al. , 2008 Nisoli et al. , 2005 , and decreased mito-chondrial generation of ROS Descamps et al. , 2005 Sohal et al. , 1994 . These benefits extend to neuroprotection against injury and cellular death Anson et al. , 2003 . The beneficial effects of CR act via the SIRT1 pathway which is upregulated under CR Cohen et al. , 2004 Rodgers et al. , 2005 Rogina and Helfand , 2004 Tissenbaum and Guarente , 2001 though this can be tissue specific Chen et al. , 2008 . SIRT1 is an NAD ? -dependent deacetylase regulating genes involved in energy and oxidative regulation . Sirtuins can have neuro-protective effects independent of its deacetylase activity , possibly due to its antioxidant effects Pfister et al. , 2008 and can also regulate oxidative stress genes through binding with FoxO tran-scription factors Brunet et al. , 2004 . It also interacts with , and deacetylates PGC1a Gerhart-Hines et al. , 2007 Rodgers et al. , 2005 which induces mitochondrial biogenesis Civitarese et al. , 2007 Tan et al. , 2008 , maintains PGC1a in its active form bound to chromatin and increase rates of gene transcription . The much-touted resveratrol , a plant-derived polyphenol found in red wine and other berry products is a SIRT1 activator Inoue et al. , 2003 Lagouge et al. , 2006 Parker et al. , 2005 . Although CR proves to be a key means by which to manipulate mitochondrial function for improved health , pharmacological interventions may prove to be a much more palatable approach . 8.2 . Key regulators of mitochondrial biogenesis Mitochondrial biogenesis involves signalling via numerous transcription factors and transcriptional co-activators . PGC1a is a critical regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis Lin et al. , 2002 Scarpulla , 2008 , energy homeostasis and respiration Corton and Brown-Borg , 2005 Feige and Auwerx , 2007 Puigserver and Spiegelman , 2003 Wu et al. , 1999 . PGC1a is a key nutrient sensing system that in turn activates peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors PPARs , and a host of nuclear transcription factors including NRFs , ERRa , MEF-2 that drive mitochondrial biogenesis Civitarese et al. , 2007 . The most prevalent transcrip-tion factors of mitochondrial genes are nuclear respiratory factors NRF-1 and NRF-2 Virbasius et al. , 1993a , b and the estrogen related receptor ERR8-alpha that works in concert with the PGC1 family Scarpulla , 2002 . Recent work in cell and animal models of mito-chondrial disease points to increased mitochondrial biogenesis through PGC1a activation as a potential therapeutic intervention for diseases of mitochondrial dysfunction Bastin et al. , 2008 Srivastava et al. , 2009 Wenz , 2009 Wenz et al. , 2008 . The activity of PGC1a is in turn regulated by control of expression levels , as well as post-translational modifications . PPARs are groups of ligand controlled transcriptional regulators that have been shown to regulate PGC1a activity Hondares et al. , 2007 Scarpulla , 2008 . PPARs are metabolic sensors that bind DNA at the PPAR response element , and are responsible for the tran-scription of many genes involved in mitochondrial metabolism , fatty acid transport and mitochondrial oxidation and energy uncoupling . There are numerous fatty acids that bind to PPARs to allow targeted gene expression Gervois et al. , 2000 . PPARs are often activated by dietary factors such as fatty acids , providing a direct link between gene expression and metabolic state . Synthetic PPAR alpha agonists are of the class fibrates including Bezafibrate , Clofibrate , Fenofibrate , Ciprofibrate and Gemfibrozil or thiazolidinediones and are used to normalize lipid and glucose parameters and exert anti-inflammatory effects . These fibrates have already been demonstrated to benefit metabolic syndrome Akiyama et al. , 2005 Barish et al. , 2006 Staels , 2007 , type 2 diabetes Cheng and Leiter , 2008 Gross and Staels , 2007 Nehlin et al. , 2006 . Bezafibrate has been shown to increase respiration in patient cell lines with OXPHOS defects Bastin et al. , 2008 Wenz et al. , 2008 . Targeted usage of fibrates as PPAR agonists may be a means to control expression of selected genes responsible for mitochondrial biogenesis Bastin et al. , 2008 Benton et al. , 2008 Wenz et al. , 2008 . Another relevant process that holds therapeutic potential is the cycling or turnover of mitochondria , perhaps as a means to increase the surveillance of damaged organelles . Cells have the capacity for degradation of unwanted or damaged proteins Varshavsky , 2005 , as well as the means to dispose of entire organelles by autophagy Scherz-Shouval and Elazar , 2007 . In calorie restriction there is increased mitochondrial autophagy �mitophagy� Jia and Levine , 2007 in conjunction with increased mitochondrial biogenesis Lopez-Lluch et al. , 2006 Miwa et al. , 2008 Nisoli et al. , 2005 . These changes have been reported to be responsible for the increased lifespan seen in CR a key player in regulation of this process may be SIRT1 as discussed earlier . An increase in the mitochondrial turnover rate might be beneficial for cells since mitochondria are one of the key organelles damaged during aging . Mitochondrial fission also plays a role in turnover , as it is involved in separating out damaged mitochondria , by dissection of depo-larised mitochondria , which are then selectively removed by autophagy Wikstrom et al. , 2009 . The overall outcome for the increased cycling is thus replacement of damaged organelles with younger , more efficient mitochondria . We summarize these key mitochondrial biogenesis factors , their intersecting networks and their clinically trialled agonists in the scheme of Fig. 1 . 9 . Conclusion The retinal ganglion cell is highly susceptible to primary or secondary impairment of mitochondrial energy generation , where many neurodegenerative diseases with proven mitochon-drial defects show preferential loss of this neuronal population . The optic nerve therefore represents a unique model system to further investigate mechanisms of neurodegeneration and experimental neuroprotection , especially since direct , non-invasive functional measurements can be performed using electrophysiological tests . Common themes in pathogenesis are OXPHOS defects , increased ROS production and altered mitochondrial dynamics . Glaucoma is increasingly seen as a neurodegenerative disease , and both circumstantial and direct evidence is building in the literature for mitochondrial defects contributing to the pathogenesis of this common blinding disease . Viewing glaucoma as a mitochondrial neurodegenerative disease opens up new avenues of therapeutic approach , based on increasing mitochondrial biogenesis or improving quality control in the mitochondrial life cycle . Further work guided by this hypothesis may define sub-types of glaucoma amenable to such therapies , and allow a shift from the traditional IOP management approach .

20706273	Review www.nature.com cdd Apoptosis is a form of programmed cell suicide in which damaged or unnecessary cells implicated in biological processes ranging from embryogenesis to ageing , from normal tissue homoeostasis to many human diseases , are discarded cleanly without affecting the surrounding cells and without unleashing an inflammatory or immune response.1,2 Apoptosis is a regulated and controlled mode of cell death with defined phenotypic and biochemical characteristics resulting in cell dismantling into smaller , membrane-bound , spheroid corpuscles called apoptotic bodies . Apoptotic bodies contain cytosol , degraded proteins and deoxyribonucleic acid DNA , organelles , intracellular membrane structures and fragments of the nucleus , and prevent cell content to be poured into the extracellular space . Apoptotic bodies externalize eat-me signals in the form of specific molecules such as phosphatidyl-serine or certain membrane carbohydrates , which are critical for their recognition and phagocytosis by neighbouring and immune system cells.1,2 In addition to cell dismantling into apoptotic bodies , other hallmarks of apoptosis include i the onset of core signalling cascades leading to the activation of determined proteases most prominently caspases that cleave and inactivate specific target molecules related to key cellular processes and activate others required for the execution of apoptosis ii internucleosomal DNA fragmentation , chromatin conden-sation and nuclear rupture iii disruption and reorganization of the cytoskeleton and contractile proteins and iv cell shrinkage.1,2 Apoptotic volume decrease AVD leading to cell shrinkage is generally an early event in the course of apoptosis . It was noticed in the initial studies describing the process of apoptosis as a universal characteristic of apoptotic cells.3,4 The precise mechanisms underlying AVD are not fully understood . It is believed that K ? Cl efflux and Na ? movements drive water extrusion off the cell . Two stages of AVD have been described , with distinct roles in the process of apoptosis.5�7 The first stage is characterized by a reversal of the normal Na ? and K ? gradients , leading to Na ? accu-mulation and K ? extrusion . It is estimated that these electrolytic movements are responsible for 20�40 % of the cell volume decrease , which occurs before cytochrome c release from the mitochondria.6 A second , independent stage of volume loss to 80�85 % depends on correct cytoskeleton organization and also relies on further K ? extrusion . Different cytoskeleton-disrupting agents , such as cytochalasins B , D and E and latrunculin A , prevent this second round of volume loss , along with DNA degradation and formation of apoptotic bodies.7,8 In this second stage , both cytochrome c release and caspases seem to be involved and required for AVD reviewed in Remillard and Yuan6 . Yet , a channel-mediated K ? outward movement is activated by cytochrome c independently of initiator caspase-9 activation.9 However , the specific channels and transporters implicated in the electrolytic movements , their specific modulators during apoptosis and their effect on downstream apoptotic effectors have not yet been univocally unravelled , and they fall out of the scope of this article . Indeed , there are some indications suggesting that the channels behind AVD i might be different from cell type to cell type , and ii might be redundant to ensure AVD under a variety of external and internal scenarios . This reinforces the important role of AVD in apoptosis.10�12 Experimental prevention of AVD inhibits the execution of apoptosis and even cell death in most cell types.10�12 However , it is still unclear whether AVD is per se a primary activator of the apoptotic machinery , or is another conse-quence of the electrolytic imbalance occurring early in the apoptotic process.13�16 Independently of whether AVD is a cause or a consequence , this article intends to show that AVD is Required for Cell Dismantling into Apoptotic Bodies The mathematical relationship between the volume V and surface area S of a sphere d the number of V units enclosed in each S unit , or volume-to-surface ratio equals the radius r divided by 3 Figure 1 . It follows that the shorter the radius the lower the d . Consequently , the total volume contained in any number of spheres whose total surface area equals that of a A B C AVD provides a solution for a geometrical requirement of cell dismantling into apoptotic bodies . In fact , inhibition of AVD with mechanistically different manoeuvres prevents apoptotic body formation see below . Hitherto , research on AVD has been mainly addressed towards understanding the under-lying mechanisms and towards establishing a cause�effect relationship with apoptosis and with other apoptotic events . However , speculations on potential teleological functions of AVD have not been put forward yet . In this article , we show that , for geometry�s sake , decomposition of a sphere into smaller ones under constant surface area conditions requires that a part of the volume be lost during the process . This rule has a direct parallelism with round cell e.g . lymphocyte dismantling into apoptotic bodies . The same principle is also discussed and extended over non-spherical forms and cells . Retinoid larger one is lower than the volume of the large sphere Figure 1 . In other words , decomposition of a sphere into smaller ones requires either an increase in the total surface area or a decrease in the total volume contained . Lympho-cytes and , in general , non-attached cells are spheroid cells whose dismantling into apoptotic bodies clearly resembles this situation . In order to comply with these geometrical determinants , either cell volume must grow lower or cell membrane surface area must grow larger . Among other potential functions , AVD provides a solution to spheroid cell dismantling . Figure 2 exemplifies the case of Jurkat cell dismantling into apoptotic bodies after treatment with a retinoid . Increasing extracellular potassium prevents AVD , membrane blebbing and cell fragmentation . For illustrative purposes , the total volume and surface area of apoptotic bodies formed in Jurkat cells are measured as indicated in the figure legend and compared with the volume and surface area of an average non-apoptotic cell . It can be seen that the volume wrapped in apoptotic bodies totalling the same surface area as that of a native cell is much smaller than the volume of the normal cell . The case of non-spherical cells is not so straightforward , although the same principles can be applied with some clari-fication . For simplicity , the case of a parallelepiped under-going decomposition into spheres is depicted in the poster Figure 3 . The sphere is the geometrical figure with the highest d the sphere has the smallest surface area among all surfaces enclosing a given volume and it encloses the largest ? V -57 % ? S 10.94 % volume among all closed surfaces with a given surface area . Accordingly , a parallelepiped can not be transformed into a sphere with the same volume and surface area Figure 3 . However , a parallelepiped can be mathematically decom-posed in a determined number of spheres , the whole volume of the parallelepiped being exactly divided into the spheres , and the sum of the surface area of the spheres equalling the surface area of the parallelepiped , as long as each sphere has the same d as the parallelepiped . Beyond this threshold , decomposition of the parallelepiped into a higher number of smaller spheres requires volume reduction or an increase in surface area . As all investigators in cell biology know , following detachment all cells become spheroids . This is an advantage for the package of fragments , because of the sphere having the lowest d of all geometrical figures . Again , AVD provides a solution to polygonal cell dismantling into small , spheroid apoptotic bodies . Interestingly , experimental data support a relation between AVD and apoptotic body formation . Indeed , suppression of apoptotic sodium accumulation fails to inhibit several down-stream apoptotic events initiated by Fas stimulation , such as phosphatidylserine externalization , caspase activation , poly-adenosine diphosphate -ribose polymerase cleavage , chromatin condensation and internucleosomal DNA fragmen-tation but completely abolishes cell shrinkage cells even swell and apoptotic body formation.16 This suggests that AVD and apoptotic body formation might be mechanistically related . Another link between AVD and apoptotic body w 7.757 ? M h 18 ? M Isovolumetric sphere formation is provided by the action of inhibitors of cytoskeleton organization . Cytoskeletal disruption inhibits the second stage of AVD and also apoptotic body formation.7 As far as we know , these experimental manoeuvres do not exist in nature , but serve to unravel and support a connection between AVD and apoptotic body formation . Apoptotic body formation is thought to be the intermediate goal of cells committed to dying , which is directed towards facilitating the end point of the process , namely the clean disappearance of the cell remains by phagocytosis.1,2 As such , the apoptotic machinery targets specifically , rather than indiscriminately , key cellular structures and functions so that cell viability is disrupted , and cell content is fragmented and packed in small , sealed vesicles readily marked for phago-cytosis.17 Apoptosis as a whole is an active , adenosine For smaller spheres more spheres r� 6.887 ? m triphosphate ATP -consuming process18 during which certain cellular functions are preserved and reoriented towards the new fate . Among other substrates , caspases cleave proteins forming part of the cellular cytoskeleton and focal adhesion complexes , leading to i cytoskeleton rearrange-ment towards securing the apoptotic phenotype , and ii cell detachment from surrounding cells and basement mem-branes , as a landmark of the apoptotic course towards cell dismantling.1 Cytoskeleton rearrangement enables cell membrane blebbing , another hallmark of apoptosis . Blebbing is intrinsi-cally related to the formation of apoptotic bodies . Indeed , membrane protrusions originated by blebbing are considered to be the progenitors of apoptotic bodies.1,19 Blebbing also named zeiosis occurs in two stages . Interestingly , the first one occurs only in attached cells . In these cells , d is , in all cases , lower than the d of the sphere or round cell upon detachment enclosing the same cell volume , under a cytosol volume conservation principle supported by experimental evidence , and mathematically modelled under an energy minimization assumption.20 As a consequence , upon rounding , cell surface is in excess for the volume.19 This type of blebbing is also seen in cells undergoing important structural rearrangements , such as division , migration , etc.19 However , the mechanisms of this blebbing may be different from those underlying the formation of apoptotic blebs . Different types of blebs have been recognized , involving distinct participation of the different elements of the cytoske-leton and their connection with the plasmalemma.21 Still , in all situations coursing with blebbing , the cell�s shape changes , and thus blebbing-mediated crumpling of the cell membrane may serve to accommodate d . As such , ruffling of the membrane by blebbing provides a more than coincidental reconciliation for volume and surface area during the detachment phase of apoptosis until division into smaller fragments . In apoptosis , membrane blebbing is originated by microtubule disassembly and actin polymerization in the cortical microfilament network . This actin polymerization forms restriction rings for bleb enucleation and formation , and enables actin�myosin-driven contraction.22,23 Contrac-tion creates intracellular pressure and provides surface isometric tension for membrane herniation within the restriction rings , with the size of the bleb being proportional to tension.23 Actomyosin contraction is activated by phos-phorylation24 mediated by the Rho kinase isoform Rho-associated coiled-coil-forming kinase I ROCK-I , which in turn is cleaved and activated by caspases during apoptosis.19 However , other activators of ROCK-I must exist during apoptosis , since some cell types may bleb for long periods of time in the presence of caspase inhibitors.24 ROCK activity is necessary and sufficient for the formation of membrane blebs , and participates in myosin ATPase activity and in the coupling of actin�myosin filaments to the plasma membrane . The second round of blebbing occurs in all types of cells . It is partly dependent on ROCK activity and intimately related to apoptotic body formation . In fact , incubation of apoptotic cells with ROCK-I inhibitors inhibits cell fragmentation , but not other apoptotic events such as DNA fragmentation.19 Membrane blebs pinching off the cell�s main body by strong contraction give rise to independent apoptotic bodies . The release of bleb vesicles is a protease-dependent process , in which caspases seem to have a central role.24,25 It has been shown that caspase inhibition prevents the release of apoptotic bodies induced by extrinsic and intrinsic pathway activators , but not their formation by blebbing.25 Membrane blebbing induced by retinoids activators of the intrinsic pathway and Fas stimulation extrinsic pathway is comple-tely abolished by stable overexpression of B-cell lymphoma 2 Bcl-2 . However , inhibition of caspase 9 by stably over-expressing a catalytically inactive mutant of this caspase prevents apoptotic body release but only partially inhibits membrane blebbing induced by all these stimuli.25 In addition , the pan caspase inhibitor N-benzyloxycarbonyl�valine�alanine� aspartic acid�fluoromethylketone Z-VAD-fmk completely inhibits blebbing and apoptotic body release induced by Fas stimulation , but only the apoptotic body release induced by retinoids . These results indicate that the apoptotic signal must reach the mitochondria for membrane blebbing to occur , whereas the release of apoptotic bodies bleb individualization is prevented by all manoeuvres inhibiting the activation of executioner caspases . In the case of Fas stimulation , both Z-VAD-fmk by inhibiting the apoptotic signal very apically , at the level of caspase 8 10 and Bcl-2 overexpression by inhibiting mitochondrial depolarization and hyper perme-ability prevent not only apoptotic body release , but also membrane blebbing and cell death . However , inhibition of caspase 9 and downstream executioner caspase 3 prevents Fas-induced apoptotic body release but not blebbing.25 However , in the case of retinoids , the apoptotic signal upstream of mitochondria is caspase-independent.26 That is why the pan caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk can not block retinoid-induced blebbing , but prevents the executioner caspase-dependent apoptotic body release . The whole process of apoptotic execution is active at room temperature RT 19�251C , including membrane blebbing , except apop-totic body release.27 Because caspases are normally active at RT , 27 there is a caspase-independent , temperature-dependent step in the process of apoptotic body release , which remains to be determined . Most importantly , coinciding with the decisive role of AVD in securing the apoptotic goal , it might be considered that AVD plays a sentry position in the regulation of downstream events . More accurately , the electrolytic movements occurring early in the apoptotic process control both AVD and other down-stream events.6,7 Inhibition of K ? extrusion by increasing K ? extracellular concentration , or by means of K ? channel blockers , prevents all or the most relevant downstream events from taking place , including AVD and cytochrome c transloca-tion.28,29 The latter is inhibited even in cells stimulated for apoptosis with insults , whose mechanisms of action do not require caspases for cytochrome c release . This is not a trivial issue because mitochondrial injury has been proposed as the no-return point in the commitment of cells to apoptosis.30,31 Furthermore , both caspases and several nucleases responsible for apoptotic DNA fragmentation remain inhibited under the normal intracellular concentration of K ? Ki ? , whereas they become active when Ki ? lowers.10,32 This is a biochemical property , as it has been corroborated in vitro with purified enzymes subject to different K ? concentrations.32 Apoptosis protease-activating factor-1�cytochrome c�pro-caspase 9 apoptosome formation is also inhibited at physio-logical Ki ? .33 In addition , there seems to be a direct link between AVD and apoptotic body formation , independently from the control of other apoptotic events , and also indepen-dently from K ? extrusion . As explained above , inhibition of apoptotic Na ? entry also prevents AVD and apoptotic body formation , without affecting the development of the other typical characteristics of apoptosis , or the activity of caspases and nucleases . This indicates that apoptotic body formation is controlled from the first stage of AVD . At the organism level , the most important aspect of apoptosis is that cell death occurs without the release of molecules with the potential to unleash inflammation or cause injury to neighbouring cells . The end point of the apoptotic execution phase is to insure that the dying cellis appropriately packaged to avoid homeostatic havoc . In the model we propose , AVD is a predetermined and key event that , among other functions , allows the apoptotic cell to be fragmented into small apoptotic bodies by reducing the volume that has tobe packed in vesicles , whose d decreases with size . As commented , for spheroid non-attached cells this is a geometric requirement in all cases , whereas for attached cells it becomes necessary for division beyond a threshold of size . In all cases , cell volume shrinkage endows the cell membrane surface with the capacity to form an a priori undetermined number of small , sealed vesicles in which to pack intracellular debris for a clean disposal , in the case that they need to be formed in the process of cell dismantling . In a view , AVD provides a reservoir of d to be used or not by the apoptotic cell , and the potential to decide on an individual basis the size and number of apoptotic bodies , depending on the course of other cell death-related events . For instance , the apoptotic cell often culminates intoone single , shrunken corpse , or is completely split into multiple small apoptotic bodies , whereas also frequently itis fragmented into a large-or medium-sized body containing or not the nucleus and a variety of smaller ones.1 We also speculate that AVD is an early process during apoptosis10 partly because extrusion of volume out of the cell is an energy-consuming process.34 In fact , energy-depleted cells swell rather than shrink and dye through necrosis rather than apoptosis.35,36 Necrotic volume increase is caused by dysfunction of regulatory volume response due to impairment of volume-sensitive Cl channels under conditions of ATP deficiency.34 In the course of apoptosis , the cell�s energetic status must be preserved initially to some extent in order for the apoptotic machinery to work properly.18,37,38 A rapid energetic crisis aborts apoptosis and turns cell death into a necrotic-like phenotype . If AVD were left to later stages of the apoptotic course , at some point and under determined circumstances it might be compromised along with the possibility of fragmenting into small apoptotic bodies , or fragmenting at all in the case of non-attached cells . Given the important role of apoptosis not only in development and homeostasis but also in human disease , the so-called cytoplasmic events of the apoptotic course gain special impor-tance as determinants of the final fate of the cell and of the disposal of cell remains.1 Thus , further knowledge on these processes may also be of clinical interest . Precisely , aborted apoptosis or failed phagocytosis of the apoptotic cell ultimately leads to membrane disruption , release of content and activation of an inflammatory response.39,40 Inappropriate or defective cyto-solic events leading to failure of cell dismantling into apoptotic bodies may lead to a less effective phagocytosis and inflamma-tory damage potentially contributing to the appearance or magnification of pathological processes , including autoimmune diseases.17 An in-depth knowledge of the precise mechanisms underlying these processes , and those failing in disease or being altered by pathological circumstances , may help to design new therapeutic strategies.6 Conflict of interest The authors declare no conflict of interest . 10 .

20706274	Induction of apoptosis in tumor cells is one of the therapeutic strategies against different types of cancer.1�3 Apoptosis may be induced through the mitochondrial intrinsic pathway or through death receptors of the tumor necrosis factor TNF receptor superfamily , such as CD95 APO-1 Fas and the TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand TRAIL receptors , TRAIL-R1 and TRAIL-R2.3,4 Intrinsic death stimuli e.g. , anticancer drugs directly or indirectly activate the mitochon-drial pathway resulting in the release of cytochrome c and sequential activation of caspases-9 and 3 , finally leading to apoptosis.2 The receptor-mediated apoptosis pathway is initiated by ligation of death receptors with their cognate ligands , such as TRAIL and CD95 ligand CD95L , resulting in activation of caspases-8 and 10 , which induces apoptosis by subsequent activation of the executioner caspase-3 or indirectly through the mitochondria by cleavage of the Bcl-2 family protein Bid , which induces cytochrome c release.3,4 One major negative regulator of receptor-mediated apoptosis is the cellular caspase-8 FLICE -inhibitory protein c-FLIP , which blocks processing and activation of caspase-8 at the level of the death-inducing signaling complex.4 TRAIL , in contrast to the CD95L , shows virtually no toxicity on normal cells and , therefore , is a promising anticancer agent that is currently under clinical trails.3,5,6 Unfortunately , many cancer cells remain partially or completely resistant to TRAIL , and in some resistant cancers , TRAIL even stimulates survival and proliferation.7,8 The human T-cell leukemia virus type-1 HTLV-1 -associated adult T-cell leukemia lymphoma ATL is a malignancy of clonally proliferating infected mature CD4 ? T cells.9 We and others have shown that primary HTLV-1-ATL samples and ATL cell lines derived from HTLV-1-infected patients are more resistant to TRAIL-and CD95L-mediated apoptosis compared with non-HTLV-1-infected leukemic cells.10�12 Worldwide HTLV-1 has infected 15�20 million people . Patients have a poor prognosis with a survival range of less then 1 year after disease onset . So far , HTLV-1-associated ATL is incurable by presently known therapies.9 Expression of the virus transactivator protein Tax has been found to correlate with resistance to TRAIL and CD95L.10,12 Recently , we and others have shown that HTLV-1 Tax increases c-FLIP expression , which is responsible for the resistance to receptor-mediated apoptosis.12,13 Downregula-tion of c-FLIP by siRNA has been shown to be sufficient to sensitize various types of cancer cells , including the HTLV-1-associated ATL to death ligands.12,13 Therefore , c-FLIP represents a promising therapeutic target , especially for TRAIL-based therapies . c-FLIP expression is controlled at multiple levels . At the transcriptional level , c-FLIP is the target of the inducible transcription factors NF-kB and NF-AT.14,15 In addition , the 60 50 apoptosis 40 30 % 10 extracellular-signal-regulated kinase ERK and the phospha-tidylinositol 3-kinase PI3K both have been shown to regulate c-FLIP expression.16�20 Furthermore , c-FLIP protein turnover has been shown to be actively regulated by ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation.21,22 Especially , the short form of c-FLIP proteins , c-FLIPS , contains a unique C terminus that confers its preferred ubiquitination and , thus , a consider-ably shorter half-life than the long form of c-FLIP c-FLIPL .21 Activation of the stress�response c-Jun N-terminal protein kinase JNK may also promote c-FLIPL ubiquitination through phosphorylation of the E3 ubiquitin ligase Itch.22,23 We have previously shown that Rocaglamide Roc , a naturally occurring herbal compound , derived from the traditional Chinese medicinal plant Aglaia for reviews , see Proksch et al.24 and Kim et al.25 , preferentially induces apoptosis in malignant but not normal proliferating lympho-cytes.26 This preference has been partially explained by its activation of the stress�response mitogen-activated protein kinases MAPK p38 and JNK in contrast to suppression of survival MAPK ERK activity in malignant , but not normal cells.26 Recently , in vitro and an in vivo mouse T-cell leukemia model , we showed high toxicity to tumor cells and only minor toxicity towards normal cells , e.g. , activated T cells.26,27 Toxicity and cell death is mediated through suppression of c-FLIP expression at the transcriptional level by blocking NF-AT activation.27 Here , we further investigated whether Roc inhibits c-FLIP expression by additional mechanisms and whether it can be used as a sensitizer of receptor-mediated apoptosis . We show that Roc sensitizes resistant ATL cells to receptor TRAIL-R1 2 -mediated apoptosis by translational suppression of c-FLIP through inactivation of the translation initiation factor 4E eIF4E . Our studies demonstrate that Roc may serve as an adjuvant of TRAIL-based therapies in c-FLIP-overexpressing malignant cells . Roc inhibits c-FLIP expression . Recently , we have shown that Roc suppresses activation-induced expression of c-FLIP in leukemic T cells at the transcriptional level by downregulation of NF-AT activity.27 In that study , we noticed that the basal level of c-FLIP expression without activation was also reduced upon Roc treatment . Thus , we asked whether Roc can sensitize ATL cells to receptor-mediated apoptosis through suppression of c-FLIP expression . To investigate this question , we randomly chose four different ATL cell lines derived from HTLV-1-infected ATL patients SP , MT-2 , CHAMP and ATL-3 . All cell lines are characterized by the expression of the viral trans-activator protein Tax Figure 1a , and are resistant to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis compared with non-HTLV-1-infected leukemic cell lines , e.g. , Jurkat and CEM Figure 1b . All ATL cell lines express TRAIL-R1 and TRAIL-R2 at levels comparable with those of CEM and Jurkat cells Figure 1c . Thus , resistance to TRAIL-induced 0 5 20 50 100 200 0 2 4 8 16 32 apoptosis in these cells is not due to a lack of sufficient amounts of cell surface TRAIL receptors . Consistent with previous studies , 12,13 all Tax-expressing ATL cell lines express elevated levels of c-FLIP , Bcl-xL and Bcl-2 proteins Figure 1d . We then treated these cells with different concentrations of a Roc derivative , Roc-AR Figure 2a . The experiment showed that Roc-AR inhibited c-FLIP expression in a dose-and time-dependent manner Figure 2b and c , only CHAMP and SP are shown . Similar results were observed in the other two cell lines . In contrast , the expression levels of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL were not downregulated by the concentration of Roc that suppresses c-FLIP expression Figure 2c . Roc treatment also did not affect the expression levels of the Tax protein Figure 2c . Downregulation of c-FLIP expression was also observed by another two Roc derivatives Roc-A and Roc-Q data not shown . As controls , the expression levels of procaspase-8 and tubulin were unchanged . Roc sensitizes CD95L-and TRAIL-mediated apoptosis in ATL , but not in normal T cells . As knocking-down of c-FLIP by an siRNA approach has been shown to sufficiently 30 60 ATL-3 50 SP restore the sensibility of Tax-expressing leukemic cells to receptor-mediated apoptosis , 12,13 we predicted that inhibition of c-FLIP expression by Roc would lead to sensitization of HTLV-1-infected ATL cells to receptor-mediated apoptosis . As expected , treatment of the ATL cells in the presence of Roc-AR synergistically increased CD95L-and TRAIL-induced apoptotic cell death Figure 3a . In contrast , Roc-AR did not sensitize normal peripheral blood T cells to CD95L-and TRAIL-mediated apoptosis Figure 3b . The ability of Roc-AR to enhance receptor-mediated apoptosis was further demonstrated by western blot showing that the activity of caspase-8 , the main caspase involved in the extrinsic death pathway , was enhanced by the combination treatment that could be observed as early as 4 h after treatment Figure 3c . The sensitization is not due to enhanced expression of the receptors as Roc-AR did not influence cell surface expression levels of CD95 and TRAIL receptors after 12 h treatment Supplementary Figure S1 . These data demonstrate that Roc can sensitize HTLV-1-infected leukemic cells towards CD95L-and TRAIL-mediated apoptosis by downregulation of c-FLIP . Roc inhibits protein synthesis . We first investigated whether Roc-AR inhibits c-FLIP mRNA expression in c-FLIP 10 mRNA 7.5 expression c-FLIP 5 Roc-AR 1 2 3 4 Roc-AR nM CHX ng ml HTLV-1-infected ATL cells . SP cells were treated with different doses of Roc-AR for 4 h or with 100 nM Roc-AR for different times . Quantitative real-time PCR analysis showed that Roc-AR treatment had no influence on c-FLIP mRNA expression levels Figure 4a . This experiment indicates that Roc-mediated downregulation of c-FLIP in HTLV-1-infected ATL cells is not regulated at the transcriptional level . Roc belongs to a group of cyclopenta [ b ] benzofuran derivatives . Several cyclopenta [ b ] benzofuran derivatives have been shown to inhibit protein synthesis without affect-ing DNA and RNA synthesis.25 Therefore , we carried out a 35S-methionine incorporation assay to examine whether Roc-AR downregulates c-FLIP expression through inhibition of protein synthesis . In parallel , cycloheximide CHX was used as a control , which inhibits protein biosynthesis by the ribosomal machinery.28 The experiment showed that Roc-AR strongly inhibited 35S-methionine incorporation with an IC50 of approximately 30 nM Figure 4b . These data suggest that Roc-AR may downregulate c-FLIP expression through inhibition of translation . To further investigate whether Roc directly inhibits the protein synthesis machinery , we carried out an in vitro translation assay using a rabbit reticulocyte cell-free system . Luciferase mRNA was incubated with the rabbit reticulo-cyte lysate in the absence or presence of different con-centrations of Roc-AR 0�200 nM or CHX 0�200 ng ml . Luciferase protein synthesis was quantified by luminescense . The experiment showed that CHX blocked protein synthesis in a dose-and time-dependent manner Figure 4c . In contrast , 100 nM of Roc-AR , which was shown to completely block 35S-methionine incorporation Figure 4b , showed no effect on protein synthesis in the rabbit reticulocyte cell-free system Figure 4c . These data indicate that Roc does not directly inhibit the translation machinery , but rather acts through inhibition of the signaling pathway that is required for translation . Roc inhibits the MEK�ERK�MNK�eIF4E signaling pathway . Initiation of translation involves a highly regulated process . The rate-limiting step of translation is the binding of the initiation factor eIF4E to the mRNA 50 cap structure.29 The activity of eIF4E is regulated by two major signaling pathways , the ERK and the PI3K pathway.29�31 ERK phosphorylates the kinase Mnk , which in turn phosphorylates eIF4E . Phosphorylation of eIF4E increases its affinity for the 50 cap structure and thereby stimulates translation schematically depicted in Figure 5a . PI3K acti-vates eIF4E through activation of the kinase mammalian target of rapamycin mTOR .29�31 mTOR activation disrupts the interaction between 4E-BP1 and eIF4E , allowing eIF4E to bind to the 50 cap structure schematically depicted in Figure 5b . Both , ERK and PI3K pathways have been shown to regulate c-FLIP expression.17�20 We have previ-ously shown that Roc-A , a Roc derivative with a structure similar to Roc-AR , can downregulate ERK activity in different leukemic cell lines and in leukemic samples from patients.26 To investigate whether Roc-AR could also inhibit the ERK pathway in HTLV-1-infected ATL cells , SP cells were treated with Roc-AR 100 nM for different times , and the phosphorylation status of MEK1 2 , ERK , MNK1 and eIF4E was analyzed by western blot . The experiments showed that Roc-AR inhibits the phosphorylation of MEK1 2 , ERK , MNK and eIF4E and the inhibition could be detected as early as 30 min after Roc-AR treatment Figure 5a . We then investigated whether Roc-AR also interferes with the PI3K-mTOR pathway . The experiment showed that Roc-AR at a dose that inhibits c-FLIP protein expres-sion did not inhibit mTOR phosphorylation Figure 5b . As a positive control , phosphorylation of mTOR was blocked by Rapamycin in a time-dependent manner Figure 5b . Therefore , Roc can inhibit protein synthesis , e.g. , of c-FLIP by blocking the MEK�ERK�MNK�eIF4E signaling pathway . To further investigate the role of the MEK�ERK�MNK signaling pathway in regulation of the receptor-mediated apoptosis , we carried out an experiment using specific inhibitors that target activities of MEK and ERK , respectively . As expected , inhibition of MEK or ERK alone could sensitize TRAIL-induced apoptosis Figure 5c . Thus , Roc-mediated inhibition of the MEK�ERK signaling pathway contributes to sensitization of TRAIL-induced apoptosis in HTLV-associated ATL cells . It has been shown that JNK can promote c-FLIPL ubiquitination and degradation through phosphorylation of the E3 ubiquitin ligase Itch.22 We have previously shown that JNK can be transiently activated by Roc.26,27 Thus , Roc-mediated downregulation of c-FLIPL might also involve a JNK-mediated mechanism . To investigate this possibility , we carried out the experiment in the presence of the JNK-specific inhibitor SP600125 . However , we did not see clear reversal of the Roc effect using different concentrations of SP600125 Supplementary Figure S2 . This unresponsiveness to the JNK inhibitor may be explained by the fact that 1 turnover of c-FLIPL but not c-FLIPS is controlled by JNK activity.22 Therefore , preventing degradation of c-FLIPL alone may not be sufficient to overcome Roc-mediated sensitization. 2 JNK is only transiently activated by Roc 0.5�2 h .26 Thus , such short activation may not have a main role in degradation of c-FLIPL . 3 As Roc inhibits de novo protein synthesis , Roc-AR nM 0 50 100 0 50 100 the c-FLIPL level will be eventually reduced even in the presence of the JNK inhibitor . To further confirm that downregulation of c-FLIP expression by Roc is regulated through inhibition of cap-dependent translation , we examined the effect of Roc on the expression of c-FLIP whose translation is regulated through IRES , a translation mechanism independent of cap-structure.32 The experiments showed that Roc treatment resulted in the inhibition of the endogenous c-FLIPL and c-FLIPS protein expression in HeLa cells Figure 6 , left panel , transfected with the empty plasmid pGFP-IRES . In contrast , Roc failed to inhibit c-FLIPL ectopically expressed by the pGFP-IRES-c-FLIPL plasmid but could still inhibit the endogenous c-FLIPL and c-FLIPS expression Figure 6 , right panel , transfected with pGFP-IRES-c-FLIPL . This study further demonstrates that Roc inhibits translation by targeting the eIF4E-mediated translation . Discussion Although TRAIL is a promising anticancer agent that kills various cancer cells with no toxicity to normal cells , many cancer cells remain resistant to TRAIL . For instance , most leukemias including HTLV-1-associated ATL show restricted sensitivity to TRAIL.7 We and others have recently shown that HTLV-1 Tax , the major HTLV-1 protein with oncogenic potential , confers resistance to receptor-mediated apoptosis by enhancing c-FLIP expression.12,13 This underscores the demand of therapies with agents that can target c-FLIP expression to enhance the TRAIL-signalling pathway . In this study , we show that Roc-AR enhances TRAIL-mediated apoptosis in HTLV-1-infected ATL cells by downregulation of c-FLIP expression . Two main signaling pathways , the Ras-ERK and the PI3K pathway , have been implicated in controlling c-FLIP expres-sion.16�20 The Ras�ERK pathway is also the target of the HTLV-1 oncogenic protein Tax.33,34 Recently , Ras�ERK signaling was shown to be particularly important for Tax-mediated protection of cells from apoptosis.35 Our study demonstrates that Roc can block the Ras�ERK signaling pathway and thereby downregulate c-FLIP expression through inhibition of eIF4E function , a key factor that controls the rate-limiting step of translation.29 Although inhibition of eIF4E function will lead to inhibition of translation in general , only the expression levels of c-FLIP proteins were shown to be downregulated by Roc treatment . No suppression of the expression levels of Bcl-2 , Bcl-xL and Tax was seen in Roc-treated ATL cells . It is known that c-FLIP turnover is actively regulated by a mechanism of ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation and , therefore , c-FLIP has a short half-life.21,22 Especially , c-FLIPS protein contains a unique C terminus that confers its preferred ubiquitinilation and , thus , has an even shorter half-life than the c-FLIPL.21 Thus , inhibition of de novo protein synthesis by Roc leads to downregulation of only short-lived proteins , such as c-FLIP , especially c-FLIPS . c-FLIP expression has also been shown to be controlled by the PI3K pathway.19,20 However , in our experiments , Roc did not show an inhibitory effect on the PI3K pathway . So far , HTLV-1-associated ATL is incurable by the presently known therapies.9 As TRAIL is a promising antic-ancer agent , this study is aimed to explore an approach to overcome TRAIL-resistance in HTLV-1-associated ATL cells . Sensitivity and resistance of HTLV-1-associated ATL cells to other chemotherapeutic drugs are another important issue . As Roc inhibits the MEK�ERK signaling pathway , we speculate that combinations of Roc with other chemother-apeutic drugs that target the signaling pathways different from Roc could have beneficial effects on the treatment . Future studies are planned to investigate this issue . In summary , we demonstrate that Roc inhibits expression of c-FLIP at the translational level , and thereby breaks TRAIL resistance in HTLV-1-infected ATL cells . We also show that Roc does not directly inhibit the translation machinery , instead Roc inhibits the ERK pathway leading to inhibition of phosphorylation of eIF4E , a key factor for controlling the rate-limiting step of translation . So far , therapy shows only very limited benefit to HTLV-1-associated ATL patients because of resistance of the tumor cells to apoptosis . Our study raises the possibility to develop Roc as a TRAIL adjuvant for treatment of HTLV-1-associated ATL . As many tumors express elevated levels of c-FLIP and siRNA , knock-down of c-FLIP has been shown to sensitize these cells to death ligands Roc may also be used to enhance the success of TRAIL therapy in c-FLIP-overexpressing cancers .

20706275	Intracellular acidification is , besides cell shrinkage , membrane blebbing , DNA fragmentation , and phosphatidylserine expo-sure , a commonly described phenomenon during the apoptotic process . It constitutes an early event during apoptosis and precedes mitochondrial dysfunction.1 A wide variety of apoptosis signals can cause this pH drop , typically in the range of 0.3�0.4 pH units , such as UV-irradiation , death receptor triggering , growth factor deprivation , and anticancer com-pounds , and also genes such as p53 and Bax activation.1�3 This can be accomplished by modulating the activity of plasma membrane transporters such as the alkalinising transporter Na ? H ? exchanger 1 NHE1 , which seems to be inhibited during apoptosis.1 Although it has been suggested that the pH change can contribute to caspase activation , 4 exactly how pH changes are linked to more downstream signals during apoptosis induction is only poorly understood . Reactive oxygen species ROS are long known as general mediators of apoptosis . Mitochondria are regarded as the main , but not the sole source for ROS.5 Although complex I and III have long been recognised as supplying ROS for apoptosis , 6 in recent years complex II has also been established as an efficient producer of ROS , particularly superoxides , for apoptosis induction.7 Sensitive detection methods indicated that it can surpass even complex III for ROS formation.8 Structural studies likewise indicate that complex II can produce ROS.9 However , the exact mechanism by which complex II generates ROS in response to apoptosis signals remains unknown . With only four subunits , complex II is the smallest protein complex of the mitochondrial respiratory chain and the only complex to be fully encoded by nuclear DNA.10 The SDHC and SDHD proteins form the membrane-anchoring components , which associate with two subunits facing the mitochondrial matrix SDHB , an Fe-S protein , and SDHA , a FAD-containing protein11 Supplementary Figure 1a . Com-plex II is also a component of the Krebs cycle with its succinate dehydrogenase SDH activity oxidising the metabolite succinate to fumarate . The electrons generated in this reaction are then channelled in a not completely understood pathway within complex II to ubiquinone , which is reduced to ubiquinol by the succinate ubiquinone oxidoreductase SQR activity of complex II . Finally , the reduction equivalents are shuttled to complex III in the respiratory chain.12 Here we demonstrate that various compounds and cytokines cause an intracellular pH pHi acidification and ROS formation during apoptosis . We found that these prominent features of apoptosis are linked by the specific inhibition of complex II . Results Early intracellular acidification and ROS formation during apoptosis . We set up a suitable cellular system to study the early events of apoptosis signalling . At 7 h after addition of various anticancer agents , HeLa cells showed no signs of apoptosis induction such as nuclear DNA degradation Figure 1a or phenotypic changes not shown . However , after 24h , these drugs at the concentrations used caused apoptosis as evidenced by an increase of the sub-G1 cell population . The Fas ligand FasL and tumour necrosis factor a TNF-a cytokines exerted a delayed effect on apoptosis with only a marginal sub-G1 cell population at 16h but a substantial apoptosis after 36 h Figure 1a . An additional assay for caspase-3 activity and poly ADP-ribose polymerase PARP cleavage confirmed apoptosis induction Supplementary Figure 2 . When we measured pHi 8 h after treatment and before apoptosis , we observed a pHi decrease with all pro-apoptotic signals used Figure 1b . EIPA , an inhibitor of the alkalinising transporter NHE1 used as an acidification control , markedly potentiated apoptosis in co-treatments with all agents Figure 1c . Conversely , when we transiently overexpressed NHE1 , we prevented acidification following drug and cytokine treatment and strongly reduced apoptosis Figure 1d . We were also able to show that the mitochondrial matrix acidified in parallel with the cytosolic pHi drop Figure 1e . We then studied whether ROS could be causative for apoptosis triggered by the compounds shown in Figure 1 . Using the dihydroethidium DHE probe Supplementary Figure 3a and the mitochondria-specific probe MitoSOX Figure 2a , we confirmed that all these agents could elicit the formation of ROS at 8 or 16 h after their application . Different efficiencies in ROS generation were noticed , probably because some compounds can induce ROS formation through additional pathways.13,14 Moreover , we showed that pre-treatment with PEG catalase , a cell-permeable form of catalase , 15 could reduce their potential to induce apoptosis , underlining the fundamental role of ROS in the apoptotic cascade Figure 2b . We also demonstrated that acidification impairment through NHE1 overexpression markedly reduced drug-induced mitochondrial ROS production Supplementary Figure 3b . Finally , as our previous work showed a role of complex II in ROS production and apoptosis , 16 we used the SDH inhibitor malonate and observed a reduction of apoptosis induced by all compounds , suggesting that complex II-dependent ROS accumulation is at least partly responsible for apoptosis induction Figure 2c . Specific inhibition of complex II for apoptosis induction . On the basis of our previous work16 and the results with the complex II inhibitor malonate Figure 2c , we investigated the effects of the apoptosis inducers on complex II in more detail with two assays classically used for the enzymatic activities of complex II described in Supplementary Figure 1b and c . We found that at 7 h anticancer drugs and 16h cytokines after treatment , the SDH activity of complex II was not compromised , whereas its SQR activity was inhibited by B20 % Figure 3a . Thus , we hypothesised that complex II contributes to apoptosis induction only when the SQR activity is inhibited while the SDH activity is still fully functioning , creating an uncoupling phenomenon at the complex II level . This model , however , seemed to be in conflict with the discovery in cancer cells with inactivating mutations in the complex II membrane anchoring subunits SDHC and SDHD17 that appear to lead to apoptosis resistance and tumour formation rather than cell death induction . Consequently , we set up experiments to test the consequences on the SQR and SDH activity and on apoptosis induction upon specific disruption of the various complex II subunits by shRNA constructs . Figure 3b shows that the mRNAs of all targeted complex II components were reduced after 72h , whereas the mRNA expression levels of their associated subunits remained unaffected . We also confirmed the downregulation of the respective proteins by western blot Figure 3c . Our expectation was that we detect apoptosis when the membrane-bound subunits are downregulated but not then the peripheral components of complex II were targeted . However , we did not observe any apoptosis induction following a 72-h transfection with these shRNA Figure 3d . When we measured the enzymatic activities of complex II , we found that both SDH and SQR activity were markedly and equally downregulated when SDHA and SDHB were targeted , and also when SDHC and SDHD were inhibited Figure 3e . This seems to be due to a major impairment of the whole complex assembly in the mitochondria Supplementary Figure 4 . When we targeted SDHC , SDHD , or SDHB , all the other subunits were likewise reduced in the mitochondria , except SDHA . Hence , inactivation of complex II subunits as observed in cancer cells could impair the whole complex II and , consequently , the association of an active SDH activity with an inhibited SQR function is not possible , rendering complex II incapable of apoptosis induction and promoting tumourigenesis . To further prove that the observed effects depend on complex II , we made use of SDHC and wild-type wt SDHC-reconstituted B9 cells.18,19 Stable clone 4 expressed the SDHC transgene at a level comparable to that of the parental wt B1 cells Supplementary Figure 5a . We found that by expressing wt SDHC clone 4 we could restore both SDH and SQR activity to a similar level than in parental B1 cells Supplementary Figure 5b . Importantly , complex II-reconstituted cells were also re-sensitised to apoptosis induction by anticancer drugs Figure 3f . Thus , on the basis of all these findings , we hypothesised that complex II contributes to apoptosis induction when functional complex II aggregates become inactive for the SQR activity , whereas the SDH function is still fully effective . Although this can not happen in tumour cells with complex II-inactivating mutations , in wt cells it creates uncoupling at the complex II level leading to ROS production and subsequent apoptosis . In order to assess the cellular consequences of a selective and partial SQR inhibition as observed in Figure 3a , we turned to complex II inhibitors , which facilitate a specific , concentra-tion-dependent attenuation of complex II activities 3-nitropro-prionic acid 3NP , a succinate analogue , binds to the active site of SDHA and inhibits complex II irreversibly.11 Thenoyltri-fluoroacetate TTFA inhibits a later step of the electron flow as it binds to the ubiquinone docking sites and abrogates the transfer of electrons to this molecule.11 Apoptosis assays revealed that 3NP did not elicit an apoptotic effect at the concentrations tested , whereas TTFA caused a time-and dose-dependent increase of apoptosis Figure 4a . In line with the known specificity of these compounds , we have observed an inhibition of both , SQR and SDH activity , with 3NP , while TTFA reduced only the SQR activity , before apoptosis Figure 4b , upper panel . Of note , 0.5 mM TTFA , which caused apoptosis Figure 4a , diminished the SQR activity by 20 % , a reduction also observed with the pro-apoptotic compounds Figure 3a . An in vitro dose-escalation experiment on isolated mitochondria confirmed the concentration-dependent SQR inhibition by TTFA Figure 4b , lower panel . Apoptosis signals are mediated through complex II-dependent ROS production . On the basis of the above experiments , which highlight the importance of an inhibited SQR activity without SDH impairment for apoptosis induction , we speculated that if electrons provided by succinate oxidation could not efficiently be transferred to ubiquinone , they would leak out from complex II , generate ROS , and eventually trigger apoptosis . Using DHE , we found that after an 8-h treatment and before apoptosis , ROS were rapidly generated by TTFA in a dose-dependent manner . The 3NP , on the contrary , did not show ROS production at all doses used at this early time point Figure 5a . With MitoSOX , we also demonstrated that TTFA-induced ROS had a mitochondrial origin Supplementary Figure 3c . Pre-treatment with antioxidant enzymes PEG-catalase and superoxide dismutase SOD or ROS quenchers Trolox could reduce TTFA-induced ROS production and likewise apoptosis Figure 5b and c . In addition , the transfection of plasmids coding for catalase and for mitochondrial manganese SOD MnSOD also potently diminished TTFA-induced apoptosis Figure 5d . These results suggested that complex II , if specifically inhibited , can function as a source for ROS and apoptosis induction . ROS are known to also cause the passive cell death of necrosis.20 Hence , to examine whether the observed cell death was apoptosis , we analysed specific features of apoptosis , such as caspase-3 activity and PARP cleavage , and found that both of them increased upon TTFA treatment Supplementary Figure 2 . We also performed propidium iodide PI and annexin V AV double staining and found that necrotic PI ? AV cells only marginally accumulated upon TTFA treatment Supple-mentary Figure 6a in contrast to PI AV ? apoptotic cells . PI ? AV ? double-stained necrotic or late-apoptotic cells significantly increased in response to TTFA . Nevertheless , the cell populations positive in sub-G1 apoptotic or 7-aminoactinomycin D 7-AAD necrotic and late apoptotic assays could potently be reduced by zVAD-fmk , a pan-caspase inhibitor Supplementary Figure 6b and c . We hypothesised that , if the TTFA pro-apoptotic effects are due to specific inhibition of complex II at the SQR level , upstream inhibitors of complex II such as those of the Krebs cycle fluoroacetate , fluorocitrate or of the SDH activity 3NP , malonate , would also reduce TTFA-induced ROS formation and apoptosis . Figure 5e reveals that all the upstream inhibitors of complex II reduced both ROS and apoptosis in TTFA-treated cells . Hence , these results , summarised in Supplementary Figure 7 , suggested that specific complex II inhibition contributed to pro-apoptotic ROS formation through electron leakage between the SDH activity , which is linked to the Krebs cycle , and the SQR activity , as part of the respiratory chain . Also , in contrast to pcDNA3-transfected cells , SDHC-reconstituted B9 cells were again able to produce ROS and undergo apoptosis when treated with TTFA Figure 5f con-firming the specificity of our observed effects for complex II . pH change leads to specific disintegration of complex II . We tested both complex II activities in the mitochondria kept in buffers with reduced pH in vitro , and observed a reduction in the SQR activity while the SDH activity remained unchanged Figure 6a , left panel . Cytosolic acidification imposed on cells by EIPA also triggered a reduction of the SQR activity without affecting the SDH activity Figure 6a , right panel . To explain at a molecular level the observed different enzymatic activities of complex II during apoptosis , we investigated the integrity of this protein aggregate . We separated mitochondrial proteins in a blue native gel after incubating these organelles in a phosphate buffer with normal or reduced pH . A western blot for SDHA revealed an additional band indicating the dissociation of the 100 kDa SDHA B subcomplex , which is exposed to the mitochondrial matrix , from the integral membrane protein SDHC and SDHD Figure 6b , left panel . This partial complex II dissociation is correlated with the partial loss of the enzymatic activity of SQR . The emergence of the SDHA B subcomplex was likewise apparent when intact HeLa cells were treated for 7 h with As2O3 or doxorubicin and total protein extracts separated on a blue native gel Figure 6b , right panel . The same dissociation pattern was also observed in human 293T cells Supplementary Figure 8 . Moreover , inhibition of acidification by NHE1 overexpression in HeLa cells significantly reduced the partial dissociation of complex II after drug treatment Figure 6c . Discussion pH changes cause specific inhibition of complex II . The mitochondria contain a number of master regulators for apoptosis . We have proposed that complex II of the respiratory chain constitutes such a mitochondrial factor for apoptosis control . In a previous study , we showed that defects in complex II rendered cells resistant to apoptosis induction by a wide array of pro-apoptotic signals.16 Additional independent studies also implicate complex II as an important sensor that is used by various signals for apoptosis induction . SDHD downregulation by RNAi , for example , was shown to protect neuronal cells against apoptosis by NGF withdrawal.21 Moreover , complex II inhibition by transfecting an SDHC mutant for the ubiquinone-binding site induced apoptosis.7 In this study , we addressed why complex II constitutes a major target in pro-apoptotic signalling and the mechanism of this process . Our results show that various anticancer compounds and pro-apoptotic cytokines are able to inhibit complex II specifically at the SQR level , which is responsible for ubiquinone reduction and links complex II with the respiratory chain . At the same time , the upstream SDH activity , which is associated with succinate oxidation and hence with the Krebs cycle , is not impaired . We provide evidence that this is accomplished through intracellular acidification , concomitant with mitochondrial pH decrease . This pHi drop appeared to be a synchronic event in the whole HeLa cell population , as shown by the flow cytometry density blots depicted in Supplementary Figure 9 . As pHi decline is a general phenomenon during apoptosis , 1 it could explain the ubiquitous involvement of complex II in apoptosis induction . Accordingly , pH changes were previously found in connection with some of the compounds tested here , such as FasL , TNF-a , etoposide , cisplatin , or arsenic.1,2,22�24 However , very few studies analysed the role of mitochondrial matrix pH pHM during chemically induced apoptosis . Although one work described an early mitochondrial matrix alkanisation , 4 it appears that this transient phase is followed by a significant matrix acidification leading to apoptosis.25 In our study , pHi acidification , associated with pHM drop , appears to be essential for specific SQR inhibition and subsequent apoptosis , as pHi modification by EIPA acidifying compound or NHE1 overexpression acidification inhibition can either potentiate or block cell death , respectively . Moreover , assays both in vitro Figure 6a and in intact cells Figures 3a with 1b and e for complex II activities underline the specific sensitivity of the SQR function to acidification . These data suggest that complex II is an important sensor for pro-apoptotic signals through its pH sensitivity schematised in Figure 7 . Our experiments with isolated mitochondria in buffers with different pH or recovered from cells treated with drugs indicated that complex II is unstable and can specifically dissociate . Blue native gel electrophoresis of complex II indicated that SDHA and SDHB , the two subunits exposed to the matrix and attached to the complex II-membrane anchors can be released from this complex Figure 6b . This is in agreement with earlier studies showing that their association can be broken by chaotrophic ions and treatments such as freeze�thawing.26,27 As the SDH activity is associated with SDHA B this dissociation retains this enzymatic activity but abrogates the downstream SQR function , leading to the uncoupling between SDH and SQR activity Figure 7 . ROS generation by respiratory chain complex II . Before apoptosis induction we observed a partial reduction of the total cellular complex II SQR activity Figure 3a . We believe that this is due to some of the complex II aggregates in the affected cells shutting down the SQR activity while maintaining the SDH activity Figure 7b . As a result of this specific complex II inhibition , the electron flux from the citrate cycle through complex II is altered in three ways i electrons can not efficiently be transferred to the ubiquinone-binding sites ii the electron flow is disrupted within the complex and iii the electrons react with molecular oxygen to produce superoxide radicals , which eventually trigger apoptosis Figure 7 . Of note , the DHE and MitoSOX probes used in this study have been described as relatively specific for superoxide detection , even though they may give an unspecific response for superoxides , 28 notably at the 488 nm excitation wavelength used for FACS application . However , we showed that the superoxide scavenger SOD can potently reduce i the DHE and MitoSOX signals induced upon complex II inhibition and ii the subsequent apoptosis Figure 5b�d and Supplementary Figure 3d , confirming that the complex II blockade generates superoxides . A block in various complexes of the respiratory chain has been shown to induce ROS formation and subsequent apoptosis , 5 particularly at the complex I and III level.6 Interestingly , the cleavage of complex I subunits NDUFS1 or NDUFS3 by caspases29 or granzyme A , 30 respectively , can lead to superoxides and apoptosis . Long considered a physiologically negligible site for ROS production , complex II has been recently described by us16 and others to mediate intracellular signalling through superoxide generation in a number of scenarios , such as i mutations of the coenzyme Q CoQ -binding site of SDHC in Caenorhabditis elegans , 31 Escherichia coli , 12 Saccharomyces cerevisiae , 32 and mammals 7 ii mutation or destabilisation of SDHB 33 and iii chemical inhibition of the succinate or CoQ-binding site.34 Different sites for superoxide generation within complex II have been proposed depending on the cause of complex II inhibition , notably at the SDHC D CoQ-binding site32 or between the SDHA-embedded FAD group and a downstream obstruction.33 Nevertheless , the precise molecular mechanisms of such a blockade were rarely explored . Some recent studies have evoked either a stabilisation of the ubisemiquinone radical35 or a modification of the glutathionylation and the tyrosine nitration status of SDHA.36 Our data demonstrate that another major cellular factor , pHi homoeostasis , can have an impact on complex II functions and facilitate ROS production . Role of complex II in tumourigenesis . Mutations in the SDHB , C and D subunits that cripple complex II have been found in various cancers , particularly paragangliomas and phaeochromocytomas , 17 suggesting that this confers a selective growth advantage to cells and led to define its subunits as tumour suppressor proteins.10 During the past 10 years , research exploring the biochemical causes of complex II inhibition and tumourigenesis found different metabolic pathways to be involved . First , in complex II-impaired cells , the SDH substrate succinate accumulates in the mitochondria , is transported into the cytosol , and inhibits HIF1a prolyl hydroxylase . This leads to HIF1a stabilisation and activation , 37 and finally to a pseudohypoxia tumor phenotype38 and apoptosis inhibition.21 A second pathway involves the generation of ROS in association with mutated or destabilised complex II7,33 leading to mtDNA damage39 and likewise HIF1a activation.33 Our results allow us to propose a third pathway that highlights the role of complex II as a major apoptosis regulator Numerous pro-apoptotic signals target complex II and lead to i a specific inhibition of SQR activity without SDH impairment ii uncoupling of these two enzymatic activities iii superoxide production and finally iv cell death induction . Our shRNA experiments Figure 3b�e and Supplementary Figure 4 and data from SDHC-negative B9 cells Figures 3f and 5f indicate that specific downregulation of complex II subunits inhibits the aggregation of the whole complex II in the mitochondria . This on its own does not elicit apoptosis HeLa cells , Figure 3d and even leads to anticancer drug resistance B9 cells , Figure 3f . These findings are also supported by other independent studies showing that , in cancer patients with mutations in complex II subunits , the remaining components of this complex are either not present40 or display a profoundly reduced complex II activity.41 Hence , in tumours harbouring such altered genes , the combination of a partial SQR inhibition and a fully active SDH is not possible , as both activities are downregulated , therefore impairing the apoptotic process . We believe that this is the reason why these cells can survive the onset of such mutations and eventually form tumour cells . This model does not exclude that parallel processes , such as a hypoxia-like pathway through the stabilisation of the HIF1a transcription factor , 37 also contribute to tumorigenesis . Nevertheless , our findings can contribute to explain why components of complex II function as tumour suppressor genes . In conclusion , our study brings together two common features of apoptosis in response to pro-apoptotic signals pHi change and ROS formation . We found that they are interconnected by the specific inhibition of complex II of the respiratory chain , which is accomplished by the release of the SDHA SDHB subunits from the whole complex . Cell culture and treatments .

Apoptotic cells were quantified using flow cytometry by determining the percentage of cells with subG1-DNA content . This subG1 population was analysed after cell permeabilisation and subsequent PI staining , as previously described.16,44 For some experiments , apoptosis and necrosis were quantified at the same time on non-permeabilised cells by flow cytometry with an Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated AV and PI kit , according to the manufacturer�s protocol Invitrogen , Paisley , UK .

Introduction and scope Lowering intraocular pressure IOP remains the only proven method of preventing the onset and progression of glaucoma . The role of IOP in the disease , however , remains controversial . This largely arises from the wide spectrum of individual susceptibility to IOP wherein a significant number of patients with normal IOPs develop glaucoma e.g . normotensive glaucoma , and other indi-viduals with elevated IOP show no signs of the disease . It is therefore important to understand the relationship between glau-comatous optic neuropathy and IOP , an inherently mechanical phenomenon . One common clinical feature of glaucoma is ONH cupping . This cupping can be described as having two components prelaminar and laminar Yang et al. , 2007a , b Burgoyne and Downs , 2008 . Prelaminar cupping of the ONH surface is characterized by progressive loss of the prelaminar neural tissues , which serves to increase both the depth and width of the cup , thereby increasing the cup-to-disk ratio . Laminar cupping is connective tissue-based , with the lamina cribrosa progressively moving posteriorly and excavating beneath the anterior scleral canal . In most cases , glau-comatous cupping is a combination of these two components , reflecting both damage to and remodeling of the laminar connec-tive tissues and progressive loss of retinal ganglion cell RGC axons . The purpose of this review is to examine the literature in an attempt to elucidate a biomechanical basis for glaucomatous cupping . In particular , this work will focus on the role of biome-chanics in driving cell-mediated connective tissue remodeling in the progression of laminar morphology from a normal state to that of an excavated glaucomatous state Fig. 1 While we acknowledge that there are multiple contributing factors to the pathogenesis of glaucoma Fig. 2 we will focus on laminar extracellular matrix ECM remodeling in glaucoma and the feedback mechanisms and signals that may guide progressive laminar cupping . We review the 2 . A biomechanical perspective of glaucoma It is generally accepted that the laminar region of the ONH is the principal site of RGC axonal insult in glaucoma , and therefore a natural site of interest when studying glaucoma Quigley , 2005 . In addition , the region is also interesting from a biomechanical perspective because it is a discontinuity in the corneo-scleral shell . Such discontinuities are often considered weak spots in mechan-ically loaded systems as they can sometimes be the site of substantial stress concentrations . The biomechanics of the tissues includes both the acute mechanical response of tissues to mechanical load i.e. , how they deform under load and the longer term changes in morphology , microstructure , and material properties that are driven by the mechanical environment . In a biomechanical paradigm of glau-comatous optic neuropathy , an ONH�s susceptibility to IOP insult is a function of both the acute and long-term response of the constituent tissues to elevated IOP Burgoyne et al. , 2005 . Tissue biomechanics can modulate ischemic , cellular , and other events in the ONH . Eyes with a particular combination of connective tissue geometry and stiffness , blood supply , and cellular reactivity may be more susceptible to damage at normal levels of IOP , whereas others may have a combination of these factors that can withstand pro-longed periods of relatively high levels of IOP without clinically significant deleterious effects . Our group Burgoyne et al. , 2005 Downs et al. , 2008 Sigal and Ethier , 2009 and others Levy and Crapps , 1984 Radius , 1987 Zeimer , 1995 Albon et al. , 2000 Edwards and Good , 2001 Jonas et al. , 2004 Quigley , 2005 Wells et al. , 2008 Ren et al. , 2009 have hypothesized that IOP-related deformations cause acute yield and or failure of the anterior laminar beams , thereby transferring load to adjacent beams in a cascade of damage that results in glaucomatous connective tissue cupping . While this seems plau-sible , there is surprisingly little evidence to support acute mechanical damage to the lamina as the principal mechanism of cupping . We are not aware of any studies that have reported IOP-induced yield or failure of the laminar beams , although this may be due to the lack of appropriate experimental assessment methods . Several studies have indicated that optic disk hemorrhages are a risk factor for focal glaucomatous progression Leske et al. , 2003 . These hemorrhages could arise from rupture of prelaminar 3 . Laminar connective tissue remodeling Roberts and coworkers have shown that in a monkey model of early experimental glaucoma , the volume of the laminar connective tissues is approximately 80 % larger in glaucoma eyes compared to their contralateral controls Roberts et al. , 2009 , but that the relative proportion of connective to neural tissue within the laminar region changed minimally . This study also showed that the early glaucoma eyes had an average of 27 % more horizontally oriented laminar beams through the thickness of the lamina than their contralateral controls . One interpretation of these results is that in the experimental glaucoma eyes , the immediate retro-laminar septa synthesized connective tissue and were essentially recruited into the 3D load-bearing structure of the lamina . These changes may be driven by responses to the altered biomechanical environment see below , and we propose that the lamina cribrosa be viewed as a portion of the larger 3D glial structure of the ONH Oyama et al. , 2006 that has synthesized the additional connective tissue components necessary to bear the forces of IOP . There is also evidence suggesting that remodeling of the lamina results in a progressive posterior movement of the laminar inser-tion into the canal wall . Such a migration eventually results in the posterior lamina inserting into the pia mater . This has been observed in ostensibly healthy human eyes Sigal et al. , 2010a Fig. 5 , and more recently in monkey eyes with experimental glaucoma Yang et al. , 2010 . Careful inspection of the glaucoma eye in Fig. 1 suggests that the lamina may partially insert into the pia . Extensive remodeling of the lamina cribrosa extracellular matrix ECM occurs in primary open angle glaucoma . For example , in et al. , 2009 , which could act as another potential mechano-transduction mechanism in the lamina . It has been established in other systems that the biologic response of tissues and cells depends strongly on the mode of the strain stimulus tension , compression or shear , as well as on their magnitudes and temporal profiles Edwards et al. , 2001 LaPlaca et al. , 2005 Pedersen and Swartz , 2005 . It is therefore of interest to determine which modes of strain and stress the tissues of the ONH are exposed to as IOP is elevated . Note that strains are generally not homogenous Sigal et al. , 2007 . When the LC deforms , some regions could be highly strained in different modes , while others remain largely unaffected . This is important because the biological effects on cells are likely to be more dependent on the local levels of strain or stress than on global levels Tan et al. , 2006 Wang and Thampatty , 2006 . Developing a comprehensive mechanistic understanding of the role of biomechanics in glaucoma using in vitro studies has been hampered by the lack of data on the true stresses and strains that the cells in the lamina experience . This is principally due to the technical challenges of measuring these quantities in vivo . Advances in imaging , such as second harmonic imaging Brown et al. , 2007 , or deep-scanning SD-OCT Kagemann et al. , 2008 Agoumi et al. , in press may soon enable the reliable measure-ment of IOP-induced laminar deformation in vivo . 5 . Modeling of laminar biomechanics Numerical modeling has therefore become a common approach to study ONH biomechanics and evaluate hypothetical scenarios Edwards and Good , 2001 Sigal et al. , 2005 , 2009a , b Sander et al. , 2006 Downs et al. , 2009 Grytz and Meschke , 2009 Sigal , 2009 Roberts et al. , 2010 , in press . Fig. 6 shows an example of the predictions made with a finite element model of the ONH . Although the magnitude and distribution of the strains depends on the assumed shape and mechanical properties of the tissues , there has been remarkable consistency in the predictions made with generic Bellezza et al. , 2000 Sigal et al. , 2005 Grytz and Meschke , 2009 Sigal , 2009 , eye-specific Sigal et al. , 2007 , 2009a , b Roberts et al. , 2010 , in press , and analytic Edwards and Good , 2001 Sander et al. , 2006 models . All models consistently predict regions of relatively large strain in the peripheral lamina . Models have also been used to study how ONH biomechanics are affected by the changes in the lamina and sclera associated with early experimental glaucoma . Eye-specific models created from 3D reconstructions of monkey ONHs show that for an identical IOP increase , laminar stresses were lower in the early experimental glaucoma eye than in the contralateral normal eye Roberts et al. , in press . The stress-lowering effects of laminar thickening and cupping have also been reported in sensitivity studies based on axisymmetric generic models of the human ONH Sigal et al. , 2005 Sigal , 2009 and in parameterized models of the monkey eye Sigal et al. , 2010c , d . When considered together , these studies suggest that connective tissue remodeling may be triggered within an ONH exposed to levels of stress and strain that exceed the physiologic tolerance of the resident cells . This suggests a biomechanical feedback mechanism through which cells modify their local envi-ronment in an attempt to return to a homeostatic mechanical environment . Note that this cascade of events could occur at IOPs in the normal range in eyes that are particularly susceptible to IOP-related stress , strain , ischemia , or cellular activation because of their individual geometric , material , vascular , and other properties . 6 . Conclusion When viewed in the context of ONH biomechanics and the glaucomatous changes in the laminar ECM at the anatomic , struc-tural , cellular and subcellular levels , it seems plausible that connective tissue remodeling is a mechanism in the progression of laminar morphology from a normal state to that of a cupped , excavated glaucomatous state Fig. 7 . This remodeling is adaptive , at least for the load-bearing connective tissue , although it may not prevent irreparable harm to the retinal ganglion cells .

20708611	Review Rudolf Fuchshofer* a r t i c l e i n f o Article history Keywords 1 . Introduction In patients with primary open angle glaucoma POAG , the optic nerve head ONH shows characteristic cupping correlated with visual field defects . The progressive optic neuropathy is character-ized by irreversible loss of retinal ganglion cells RGC . The critical risk factor for axonal damage at the ONH is an elevated intraocular pressure IOP Collaborative-Normal-Tension-Glaucoma-Study-Group , 1998a , b The-AGIS-Investigators , 2000 Gordon et al. , 2002 Leske et al. , 2003 . IOP is increased when aqueous humor AH outflow resistance in the juxtacanalicular region JCT of the human trabecular meshwork TM is abnormally high Grant , 1963 Johnson , 2006 . The mechanisms that are responsible for the increase in TM outflow resistance in POAG are unclear Johnson , 2006 Tamm and Fuchshofer , 2007 . There is some evidence though that changes in the amount and quality of the TM extra-cellular matrix ECM are involved , as eyes with POAG show a significant increase in fibrillar ECM in the JCT outflow pathways Lutjen-Drecoll et al. , 1986 Rohen et al. , 1993 . The increase in IOP correlates with axonal loss in the ONH , which might be due to an impaired axoplasmatic flow leading to inhibition of retrograde transport of neurotrophins Quigley et al. , 2000 , and finally to the loss of RGCs . In addition , it is known from histological studies that glaucomatous changes of the ONH are associated with reactivation of astrocytes Quigley , 1993 Neufeld and Liu , 2003 , which is characterized by an increased expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein GFAP and neural cell adhesion molecule NCAM Varela and Hernandez , 1997 Pena et al. , 1999a , b Yang and Hernandez , 2003 . Damage to the optic nerve is thought to occur in the lamina cribrosa LC region of the ONH Quigley and Addicks , 1980 Quigley et al. , 1983 , which is composed of characteristic sieve-like connective tissue cribriform plates through which RGC axons exit the eye Oyama et al. , 2006 . The cupping of the optic disc , and the compression and excavation of LC are characteristic signs of glaucomatous ONH remodelling Quigley and Addicks , 1980 Quigley et al. , 1983 . The prelaminar and laminar regions undergo massive changes in POAG , and frequently show an increase in elastic fibers with a disorganized distribution and deposition , embraced by the term elastosis Pena et al. , 1998 . In the postlaminar compartment , a typical pronounced thickening of the connective tissue septae surrounding the optic nerve fibers is found Hernandez et al. , 1989 , 1990 , 1994 Gottanka et al. , 2005 . Among these differences , an increase in density and area occupied by basement membrane BM material is a prominent finding in human glaucomatous ONH Hernandez et al. , 1994 . The pathogenic factors responsible for the structural alterations in POAG patients are still unknown , but as there are homologues changes in the ECM of the TM and the ONH , it was hypothesized that in POAG there are factors , which circulate in the aqueous humor AH and which are present in the vitreous . Such factors could cause glaucomatous changes in the optic nerve , either alone or synergistically with increased IOP . A major candidate fulfilling these demands is transforming growth factor TGF -b2 , a factor that is significantly elevated in the AH of approximately 50 % of POAG eyes Granstein et al. , 1990 Tripathi et al. , 1994 Inatani et al. , 2001 Picht et al. , 2001 . Support for a possible involvement of TGF-b2 in ONH modification was provided by the finding that the TGF-b2 levels in the ONH of glaucomatous eyes are elevated and that astrocytes of the ONH , the major glial cell population in that region , which participates in ECM synthesis , predominantly express this isoform of the TGF-b-family Pena et al. , 1999a , b . 2 . Transforming growth factor b Transforming growth factor-b TGF-b is a member of a family of dimeric polypeptide growth factors . There are three isoforms of TGF-b TGF-b1 , TGF-b2 , and TGF-b3 , which are each encoded by a distinct gene . In the eye , TGF-b2 has been demonstrated to be the predominant TGF-b isoform present in the neural retina , retinal pigment epithelium , choroid , and in the vitreous Pfeffer et al. , 1994 . TGF-b2 has been detected as the predominant isoform of TGF-b in ONH and in AH Pena et al. , 1999a , b Picht et al. , 2001 . Localization of TGF-b2 in the ONH suggests that TGF-b2 is probably synthesised by neuroglial cells . In glaucomatous ONH , there is a massive increase in the levels of TGF-b2 which is mainly localized to reactive astrocytes that line the vitreal surface and occupy the prelaminar region , the compressed cribriform plates , and the nerve bundles in the lamina cribrosa Pena et al. , 1999a , b . These astro-cytes are characterised by cellular hypertrophy , increased glial fibrillary acidic protein GFAP expression , and round cell bodies with retracted cell processes . The reactive astrocytes migrate from the core of the cribriform plates into the nerve bundles Varela and Hernandez , 1997 . TGF-b2 was mainly localized in the cytoplasm of the astrocytes in the glaucomatous ONH , which were located inside the nerve bundles Pena et al. , 1999a , b , leading to the assumption that the increased TGF-b2 concentration represents a de novo synthesis of this growth factor by the reactive astrocytes . New synthesis of TGF-b2 would predominantly result in the formation of the latent complex of TGF-b2 , which could not be discriminated by histological stainings in the ONH . The fact that there is more total TGF-b in POAG eyes suggests that there is presumably more available TGF-b that can be activated to exert its effects in these tissues . In vitro data supports this suggestion as TGF-b2 has the capability to induce thrombospondin-1 TSP-1 in cultured ONH astrocytes Fuchshofer et al. , 2005 . TSP-1 is a matricellular protein which belongs to a small family of secreted glycoproteins Adams et al. , 2001 and is a very potent activator of latent TGF-b in vivo and in vitro Schultz-Cherry et al. , 1994 Crawford et al. , 1998 Murphy-Ullrich and Poczatek , 2000 . Matricellular proteins are secreted proteins that influence cell function by modulating cellematrix interactions Bornstein , 2001 . Accordingly , TSP-1 mightbe critical forTGF-b2 activationin the ONH . 3 . TGF-b2 and extracellular matrix remodelling Normally , the ECM of the ONH forms a framework and gives structural resiliency to the ONH Oyama et al. , 2006 . In POAG , basement membrane thickening involving altered collagen fibers increased collagen I and VI and elastin fibers disorganized distri-bution and deposition has been correlated to weakness of the LC Hernandez et al. , 1990 Pena et al. , 1996 . ONH astrocytes and LC cells are two major cell types present in the ONH that support axons by synthesizing growth factors and ECM Hernandez et al. , 1988 , 2000 . Different in vitro studies showed that increased concentra-tions of TGF-b2 in the ONH could be involved in the remodelling of the ECM in ONH of POAG patients . TGF-b2 induces the synthesis of collagen types I , IV and VI as well as of fibronectin . The dysregulation of these ECM components could thereby contribute to the basement membrane thickening in the LC of the ONH . Moreover , a massive induction of elastin and its mRNA by TGF-b2 was observed in ONH astrocytes . Failures in the amount and deposition of elastin are the major cause of elastosis in the LC of glaucomatous patients . It is of great interest to note that all of these changes in ECM synthesis are mediated by a downstream factor of TGF-b2 , namely connective tissue growth factor CTGF . CTGF is a member of the CCN CTGF , cysteine-rich angiogenic protein 61 , and nephroblastoma over-expression gene family of regulatory proteins . CTGF was detected in different compartments of the eye like the TM Tomarev et al. , 2003 or in the aqueous humor van Setten et al. , 2002 . In a recent study Junglas et al. , 2009 , we could show that recombinant CTGF is as potent as TGF-b2 to induce ECM expression in TM cells . In ONH astrocytes , silencing of CTGF with the help of siRNAs prevents the induction of ECM proteins by TGF-b2 Fuchshofer et al. , 2005 , making CTGF to a potent target for therapeutical modulations . Not only an increased synthesis of ECM proteins could lead tothe malformation in the LC of ONH , but also an impaired degradation of ECM proteins can lead to the disruption of the homeostatic balance between formation and degradation of ECM proteins . Neumann et al. could show that increased TGF-b2 activity might also result in the thickening of the connective tissue septae by a reduced prote-olysis Neumann et al. , 2008 . The degradation system is mainly represented by matrix metalloproteinases MMP which are secreted as inactive proMMPs . Activation is mediated by different enzymes like plasmin . Activated MMPs can be blocked by tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases TIMP activity , which inhibits the active MMPs through reversible binding . In vitro all of these components are expressed by astrocytes , MMP-1 , -2 , -3 , -7 , -12 are constitutively present , as well as TIMP 1 -3 . Regarding the activation of the plasminogen-plasmin system , two components are synthe-sized in astrocytes the activator of this system namely tissue plasminogen activator tPA and the endogenous blocker plasmin-ogen activator inhibitor-1 PAI-1 . TGF-b2 has no significant effects on the expression of MMPs , TIMPs and tPA , whereas PAI-1 is dramatically increased by TGF-b2 Neumann et al. , 2008 . The upregulation of PAI-1 can lead to an decrease of MMP activity in astrocytes as it was previously described in the TM Fuchshofer et al. , 2003 . In astrocytes the TGF-b2 induced expression of PAI-1 leads also to a reduced activity of MMPs and thereby shifts the balance towards an enhanced ECM deposition . According to knock down experiments using siRNA , the effect of TGF-b2 on the degradation system is not mediated by CTGF , a finding that is in accordance with data from the TM , where recombinant CTGF does not alter the expression and activity of the degradation system . 4 . Bone morphogenetic proteins and gremlin In the last couple of years other members of the TGF-b super-family came into the focus of glaucoma research , namely the bone morphogenetic proteins BMP . Wordinger et al. described that BMP-2 , BMP-4 , BMP-5 , and BMP-7 and the BMP-receptors BMP-RIA , BMP-RIB , and BMP-RII are expressed by ONH astrocytes and LC cells Wordinger et al. , 2002 . In general , BMP signals are mediated by type I and II BMP receptors and their downstream molecules Smad1 , 5 and 8 . Phosphorylated Smad1 , 5 and 8 proteins form a complex with Smad4 and are translocated into the nucleus to interact with other transcription factors and to initiate transcription of target genes Chen et al. , 2004 . In contrast , activation of TGF-b receptors bytheirligands causes the activation and phosphorylation of Smad2 and 3 , followed again by heterodimerization with Smad4 and translocation into the nucleus Attisano and Wrana , 2002 . It is known that BMPs play an essential role for the development of the eye , especially BMP-4 as heterozygous deficiency of BMP-4 leads to abnormalities of the optic nerve and to an elevated IOP . In adult human ONH the occurrence of BMP-4 and of phosphorylated Smad1 was demonstrated by western blot experiments and immunohis-tochemistry . In addition , in vitro studies in ONH astrocytes and LC cells observed that exogenous treatment with BMP-4 activates the canonical BMP signaling pathway by phosphorylation of Smad 1 , 5 and 8 Zode et al. , 2007 . More recent experiments showed a constitutive expression of BMP-4 and BMP-signaling in the ONH , which might play a role for homeostatic balance between growth factors . BMP-4 can counteract TGF-b2 effects in ONH astrocytes . The enhanced expression of ECM components like FN , elastin , collagen type I and VI through TGF-b2 is markedly reduced by BMP-4 in ONH astrocytes and LC cells Zode et al. , 2009 . Also the TGF-b2 induced PAI-1 synthesis is blocked by BMP-4 , so that the dysregulation of ECM synthesis and of the degradation system is kept in balance by BMP-4 treatment Zode et al. , 2009 . Overall , the effects of BMP-4 on OHN astrocytes are markedly similar to those observed for BMP-7 and BMP-4 in the TM Fuchshoferet al. , 2007 . Astheexpression ofBMP-4 isnot changed in the glaucomatous ONH , the disruption of the homeostatic balance betweenthe growthfactors seems to bedue tothe increase of TGF-b2 , especially through the induction of gremlin by TGF-b2 . Gremlin is an important extracellular BMP antagonist that binds to BMP-2 , BMP-4 and BMP-7 , thus preventing these BMPs from interacting with their receptor complex Balemans and Van Hul , 2002 . In ONH astrocytes and in LC cells TGF-b2 leads to an induction of gremlin and thereby to an induction of FN . The presence of large amounts of gremlin in the ONH of POAG patients could be one link in the interaction between TGF-b2 and BMP-4 in the ONH Fig. 1 . The upregulation of TGF-b2 could lead to an induction of gremlin and thereby to an inhibition of BMP-4 . This would lead to unopposed TGF-b2-stimulated ECM synthesis , and deposition and remodelling of the ONH . 5 . Conclusion The available in vitro and in situ data strongly indicate that TGF-b2 is a key player in modulating those ECM changes that are associated with remodelling of ONH structures in POAG patients , supporting the hypothesis that the changes in the TM and in the ONH of POAG patients are under control of the same signalling molecule , namely , TGF-b2 . This idea is further supported by the striking parallels between TM and OHN regarding the molecules which interact with TGF-b2 signaling such as CTGF , gremlin and BMP-4.Overall , ECM synthesis is kept in balance in the OHN by factors that augment or block the activity of TGF-b2 Fig. 1 . Future tasks will be to identify further parts of the signaling network which regulates homeostasis of ECM turnover in the OHN , and to elucidate why the system fails in POAG .

20709058	G�lg�n Tezel a , b , * a r t i c l e i n f o Article history Keywords It is today�s common view that glaucoma is a multifactorial disease and many of the proposed mechanisms traditionally linked to elevated intraocular pressure IOP -related factors may facilitate disease progression independently from IOP elevation . Elevated IOP-related factors are well recognized to trigger initial neuronal damage through biomechanical and ischemic injury processes . However , a complex interplay of cellular events triggered by IOP-related or -unrelated stimuli may also amplify the primary injury process and contribute to disease progression . IOP-dependent versus IOP-independent components of the glaucomatous injury are commonly thought to be determined by individual suscepti-bility factors related with various genetic and epigenetic parame-ters yet to be further identified Weinreb and Khaw , 2004 Quigley , 2005 . Keeping the big picture of glaucoma in view , in addition to endogenous signals triggered in retinal ganglion cells RGCs , environmental influences , particularly including neuroneglia interactions , are equally important for neuronal cell death or survival decisions . Complex cellular interactions determining the RGC fate in response to glaucomatous stress also exhibit important links to different components of the immune system Tezel , 2009 . The pioneering work of Rosario Hernandez on optic nerve head astrocytes has provided important impacts in the field of glaucoma research Hernandez and Ye , 1993 Hernandez and Pena , 1997 * Department of Ophthalmology Visual Sciences , University of Louisville School of Medicine , Kentucky Lions Eye Center , 301 E.

Hernandez et al. , 2008 and inspired many other studies illumi-nating different aspects of neuroneglia interactions in glaucoma-tous neurodegeneration and immune response . Besides intrinsic signals triggered in different subcellular compartments of RGCs , signals arisen from the microenvironment are also critically important for neuronal cell fate decisions during glaucomatous neurodegeneration . Macroglial cells , including retina and optic nerve astrocytes and retinal M�ller cells , constitute the major cell type exhibiting important homeostatic interactions with RGCs . Another glial cell type , also having important impacts in glaucomatous neurodegeneration , is microglia , specialized tissue macrophages . Progressive degeneration of optic nerve axons and RGCs in human glaucoma is accompanied by chronic alterations in structural and functional characteristics of glial cells in the optic nerve head Hernandez and Pena , 1997 Hernandez et al. , 2008 and retina Wang et al. , 2002 Tezel et al. , 2003 . Elevation of IOP in experimental animal models similarly results in a prominent acti-vation response of both macroglial and microglial cells Wang et al. , 2000 Naskar et al. , 2002 Lam et al. , 2003 Woldemussie et al. , 2004 Ju et al. , 2006 Inman and Horner , 2007 . Rosario Hernandez was the front-runner of experimental studies focused on the glial response to glaucomatous conditions . Over the past two decades , experimental studies using in vitro and in vivo models , along with the studies of human donor eyes , have substantially contributed to current understanding of the diverse roles of glial cells in glaucoma . Findings of these studies show that the high level of plasticity of glial cells allows them to rapidly respond to any homeostatic imbalance by exhibiting a phenotype commonly referred to as activated on the basis of changes in cell morphology and expression of cell markers Hernandez and Pena , 1997 Tezel et al. , 2003 Hernandez et al. , 2008 . Another widely accepted outcome of these studies is that after transformation into an activated phenotype , glial cells may exhibit insufficiency or dysfunction in their normal neurosupportive abilities , thereby leading to increased vulnerability of RGCs and their axons to injury Morgan , 2000 Neufeld and Liu , 2003 Hernandez et al. , 2008 Johnson and Morrison , 2009 Tezel , 2009 . Altered glial functions in glaucoma are supported by dramatic alterations in gene expression involved in signal transduction , cell proliferation , cellecell interaction , cell adhesion , extracellular matrix synthesis , and immune response Johnson et al. , 2000 Hernandez et al. , 2002 Miyahara et al. , 2003 Ahmed et al. , 2004 Steele et al. , 2006 Kompass et al. , 2008 . Despite progress in understanding of glial responses , little is known about their distinct states or temporal sequences during the course of glaucomatous neurodegeneration Nickells , 2007 . For example , a prominent increase in astrocyte reactivity has been detected early in the neurodegeneration process in different animal models of glaucoma . In contrast , the activation of microglia and the loss of oligoden-drocytes have occurred late after large-scale neuronal loss Son et al. , 2010 . In a more recent study of experimental rat glaucoma , astrocytic dedifferentiation and proliferation , rather than reactive hypertrophy , have characterized early response in the glaucoma-tous optic nerve head Johnson et al. , 2010 . These early responses of astrocytes may be important for their compromised ability to provide axonal support in early disease stages . In addition to temporal and spatial alterations in glial responses , evidence also supports distinct profiles of gene expression in optic nerve head astrocyte cultures derived from human donor eyes Miao et al. , 2008 . The population-based differences in glial responses may be related to differential susceptibility for the development and or progression of glaucomatous neurodegeneration . With an emphasis on the relative protection of glial cells from glaucomatous injury , chronic activation response of stressed glial cells may increase their own survival Tezel and Yang , 2005 but result in a lessening of their neurosupport functions . For example , the ability of glial cells in buffering extracellular glutamate may diminish in glaucoma Martin et al. , 2002 Moreno et al. , 2005 . Besides such a passive neurodestructive influence , glial cells may also be actively damaging through a range of cellular processes that promote neuronal injury . Owing to the increased production of extracellular matrix and adhesion molecules , glial cells play important roles in remodeling of the optic nerve head in glaucoma Hernandez , 2000 . Alterations in the biomechanical environment of the optic nerve head through tissue remodeling events may generate additional stress on axons Downs et al. , 2005 and inhibit axonal regeneration Silver and Miller , 2004 . A complex range of glial responses in human glau-coma also includes an increased production of cell death mediators , such as TNF-a Yan et al. , 2000 Tezel et al. , 2001 and nitric oxide Liu and Neufeld , 2000 . Experimental evidence supports that these mediators produced by glia can be directly injurious to RGCs Neufeld , 1999a Yuan and Neufeld , 2000 Nakazawa et al. , 2006 Tezel , 2008 . Among diverse roles of glial cells during glaucomatous neuro-degeneration as neurosupportive or neurodestructive , one is linked to their immunoregulatory functions . Given their roles in phago-cytosis , glial cells , mainly including microglia , are important components of immune surveillance involved in clearing and shielding of the injured tissue Nimmerjahn et al. , 2005 . Although they act as standby cells in service of both the immune system and the neuronal tissue Schwartz , 2003a Ransohoff and Perry , 2009 , microglial cells have also been associated with chronic neurode-generative diseases Streit , 1996 Stoll and Jander , 1999 . It remains unclear whether there is an insufficiency in the glial removal of cell debris that may create an antigenic stimulus for abnormal immune response . However , recent studies increasingly implicate glial cells as participants of neuronal injury . It is clear that the glial pro-inflammatory cytokines produced at increased amounts are capable of promoting RGC death signals Tezel and Wax , 2000b , besides signaling to immune system cells and regulating their function . With respect to their increased production of cytokines Tezel et al. , 2001 , immunomediators Luo et al. , 2010b and complement components Kuehn et al. , 2006 Tezel et al. , 2010 , reactive glial cells appear to be well equipped candidates to participate in innate immune injury to neurons in glaucoma . In addition to innate immune activities , glial cells are also thought to play important roles in initiation of an adaptive immune response in glaucoma Tezel et al. , 2007b . Similar to CNS glia , retina and optic nerve head glial cells express MHC molecules and function as resident antigen-presenting cells . Not only microglial cells Matsubara et al. , 1999 , but also astrocytes express HLA-DR in human glaucoma Yang et al. , 2001b . Recent proteomic and immunohistochemical findings also support an up-regulation of glial toll-like receptors TLRs in the glaucomatous human retina Luo et al. , 2010b . Besides serving in the host defense against microbial components , specific signaling through TLRs exhibits a sensitive detection system involved in the immune response to intrinsic danger signals . In vitro studies of rat retinal microglia and astrocytes have shown that components of the glaucomatous tissue stress , including up-regulated heat shock proteins HSPs and oxidative stress Tezel et al. , 2000 , 2007a , can similarly stimulate innate and adaptive immune responses through the glial TLR signaling as evident by increased cytokine production and MHC class II expression of glial cells , and increased proliferation and cytokine production of co-cultured T cells Luo et al. , 2010b . These findings support that as being local players of the immune system in the retina and optic nerve , glial cells are able to rapidly sense the tissue stress and initiate an immune response . Another immunoregulatory function of glial cells is linked to maintaining the perivascular barrier integrity Ransom et al. , 2003 Nimmerjahn et al. , 2005 . This glial function is important for securing the immune privileged status of retina and optic nerve head to protect neurons against any vision-threatening systemic effects . Cytokines produced by perivascular microglia or astrocytes Zlokovic , 2008 Banks and Erickson , 2010 Nishioku et al. , 2010 and various other glia-related alterations in the milieu may potentially contribute to a perivascular barrier dysfunction in glaucoma . For example , increased production of matrix metal-loproteinases by optic nerve head astrocytes in human glaucoma Yan et al. , 2000 Agapova et al. , 2001 may lead to degradation of the basement membrane and glia limitans consisting from astro-cytic and microglial end feet . Splinter hemorrhages at the border of the optic nerve head that are commonly detected in glaucoma patients may best exemplify the weakened perivascular barrier integrity in glaucoma Grieshaber and Flammer , 2007 . In addition to perivascular barriers , peripapillary chorioretinal atrophy zones , also commonly detected in glaucomatous eyes , exhibit another site in which the blooderetina barrier is broken . Activation and redis-tribution of microglia in the peripapillary chorioretinal regions in glaucomatous eyes further support the gatekeeper functions of these cells in controlling the bloodebrain barrier Neufeld , 1999b . Taken together , glial cells profoundly respond to glaucomatous stress by exhibiting a chronic activation response . As discussed below , glial reactivation is commonly accepted as the hallmark of neuroinflammation in the CNS . Under normal physiological conditions , glial immunoregulatory functions do not cause an immunological imbalance and their activity may promote immune privilege rather than neurodegenerative immunity . However , in the presence of accumulating risk factors , chronic glial activation may result in a dysfunction of regulatory mechanisms , thereby leading to innate and adaptive cytotoxicity Ransohoff and Perry , 2009 . It is hoped that therapeutic manipulation may help modify the outcome of glial response for the gain of RGCs and optic nerve axons in glaucoma Tezel , 2009 . An improved understanding of glial responses and functional alterations at the molecular level may offer innovative treatment options targeting glial cells so that neurodestructive consequences of the glial activation response may be selectively inhibited without compromising glial neuro-supportive and homeostastic functions . 2 . Immune system activity and diverse consequences Evidence obtained from clinical and experimental studies over the past decade strongly supports diverse roles of the immune system in glaucoma as beneficial or destructive . An immune response is initially beneficial and necessary to restore tissue homeostasis and promote tissue cleaning , healing , and function-ality without causing an autoimmune disease . As opposed to the concept that autoimmunity is a deleterious phenomenon , the intriguing view of protective autoimmunity accepts that boosting the immune activity by immunization with the appropriate antigen , at specific timing and predetermined optimal dosing can provide neuroprotection Schwartz and Kipnis , 2002 Schwartz , 2003b . Despite seemingly conflicting aspects of the immune system involvement in glaucoma , it is now commonly recognized that if there is a defect in immune response pathways due to accumulating risk factors , the physiological equilibrium may be impaired , thereby switching the beneficial immunity into an autoimmune neurodestructive process Schwartz and Ziv , 2008 Tezel , 2009 . In view of the current knowledge summarized herein , there is an increased risk of failure in immunoregulation under glaucomatous stress conditions . Increasing number of evidence provided by clinical studies support an abnormal activity of the immune system in glaucoma patients Tezel and Wax , 2007 . Many patients with glaucoma exhibit increased prevalence of monoclonal gammopathy Wax et al. , 1994 Hammam et al. , 2008 and abnormal T cell subsets Yang et al. , 2001a similar to detected in autoimmune diseases . In addition , a recent study has detected significant alterations in Th1 and Th2 cytokine levels in the glaucomatous patient serum Huang et al. , 2010 . Ongoing studies have consistently detected increased titers of serum antibodies to various retina and optic nerve antigens which commonly include HSPs Tezel et al. , 1998 Wax et al. , 1998b Maruyama et al. , 2000 Joachim et al. , 2007 Tezel and Wax , 2007 Grus et al. , 2008 . Following applications of the mass spectrometry-based techniques have resulted in an increasing list of antigens that are recognized by serum autoantibodies in glaucoma patients Joachim et al. , 2008 Reichelt et al. , 2008 Thornton et al. , 2010 . It is important to clarify that clinical studies of immune activity have initially focused on patients with normal-pressure glaucoma due to the lack of IOP-related pathogenic factors . However , not only is the distinction of such glaucoma subgroups arbitrary , but many glau-coma patients with elevated IOP may also exhibit similar findings of aberrant immune activity . In addition to primary open-angle glaucoma , a more recent study using protein macroarrays has characterized increased serum antibodies in patients with pseu-doexfoliation glaucoma Dervan et al. , 2010 . In consistence with clinical observations , growing evidence obtained from histopathological and proteomic studies of human donor tissues supports the activation of glial immunoregulation and antigen presentation functions as discussed above in the previous section . Expression of MHC class II molecules Yang et al. , 2001b , TLRs Luo et al. , 2010b , and different complement components Kuehn et al. , 2006 Stasi et al. , 2006 Tezel et al. , 2010 is up-regulated in the retina and optic nerve head of glaucomatous human eyes . There is also evidence of immunoglobulin deposition in the glaucomatous human retina Wax et al. , 1998a . As discussed above , peripapillary chorioretinal atrophy areas Wax et al. , 1998a and splinter hemorrhages Grieshaber and Flammer , 2007 , both commonly detected in glaucomatous eyes , may provide a window of opportunity to contact with the systemic immune system and facilitate the access of serum autoantibodies into the retina and optic nerve head in these patients . Findings of experimental glaucoma are also consistent with the findings of human glaucoma . Experimental studies using micro-array analysis techniques have revealed a prominent up-regulation of gene expression mediating immune response in different animal models of elevated IOP-induced glaucoma Steele et al. , 2006 Johnson et al. , 2007 Hernandez et al. , 2008 Kompass et al. , 2008 Panagis et al. , 2010 . In addition to increased glial produc-tion of immunomediators and complement molecules , these animals with experimental glaucoma also exhibit increased proliferative activity of T cells Tezel et al. , 2008 and increased titers of serum antibodies to retina and optic nerve proteins Joachim et al. , 2009 . Similar findings in different experimental paradigms suggest that the immune activity reflects a native response to tissue stress and injury . Neurons and glia normally produce immunosuppressive signals to prevent immune-mediated injury to CNS Neumann , 2001 . Similarly , retina and optic nerve are thought to have an actively regulated immune privilege mechanism Caspi , 2006 Forrester , 2009 to protect these vital tissues against damaging effects of an inflammatory immune response . Among many factors controlling the immune privilege , elimination of infiltrating reactive T cells by apoptosis is an important common pathway in preventing the development of neurodegenerative autoimmune diseases , because these cells can recruit and activate other inflammatory cells and initiate an autoimmune injury process Bauer et al. , 1998 Pender and Rist , 2001 . Despite the immune privileged status and the immunological self-tolerance to CNS , the immune system is not fully ignorant of the nervous tissue . Parallel to profound alterations in the systemic immune repertoire , there is a shift in the local milieu of the brain from immune-hostile to immune-friendly during neurodegenerative processes Wekerle et al. , 1987 Odoardi et al. , 2007 . Many factors present in glaucomatous tissues may similarly create a proper environment to form an immunological synapse with T cells for antigen presentation . Glial antigen-presenting ability is increased in human glaucoma as supported by up-regulation of MHC class II molecules Yang et al. , 2001b and increased expression of immunomediators Luo et al. , 2010b and cytokines Tezel et al. , 2001 . Meanwhile , reactive oxygen species , production of which is amplified in human glaucoma Tezel et al. , 2007a , 2010 can function as co-stimulatory molecules during antigen presentation Tezel et al. , 2007b . Based on observations in the brain , loss of RGCs and their physiological activity during glaucomatous neurodegeneration may be particularly important in rendering these neurons recognizable by the immune system cells Neumann , 2001 . Many other factors summarized below may also contribute to an aberrant immune activity in glaucoma . Not only do numerous proteins exhibit increased expression in glaucoma , but also antigen exposure is increased due to neuronal injury . Obviously , dead cells represent an important source of autoantigens that can initiate an autoimmune response . The cell death process during the course of glaucomatous neuro-degeneration may similarly cause tissue specific systemic autoim-munity , since apoptotic RGCs with self-antigens are phagocytosed by microglia , where they may be processed and presented to the systemic immune system . It seems critically important that besides increased protein expression and exposure , various proteins exhibit post-translational modifications in glaucoma , such as oxidation Tezel et al. , 2005 , phosphorylation Yang et al. , 2008 , or citrulli-nation Bhattacharya , 2009 . By changing antigenic features of proteins , these protein modifications may also facilitate an auto-immune response . Recent observations using immunoproteomic analysis techniques support the possibility of altered antigenity in glaucomatous tissues . For example , glaucomatous patient sera react more with the glaucomatous human retinal proteins as opposed to retinal proteins obtained from non-glaucomatous control donors Thornton et al. , 2010 . Among numerous proteins exhibiting an up-regulated expres-sion in glaucoma , HSPs Tezel et al. , 2000 Luo et al. , 2010b are known to be highly antigenic and have been associated with various autoimmune diseases , including neurodegenerative diseases Young , 1992 van Noort et al. , 1995 . Besides intrinsic neuroprotective abilities of intracellular HSPs , membrane-bound or extracellular HSPs after active secretion or passive release from dying neurons may serve as immunostimulatory signals . HSPs may induce cytokine production , deliver antigenic peptides to MHC class I and class II , and activate TLR signaling , thereby playing important roles in the activation of innate and adaptive immunity implicated in autoimmune diseases van Eden et al. , 2003 Calderwood et al. , 2007 . Recent experimental findings support that glial TLRs can initiate immunostimulatory signaling upon binding by glaucomatous stress-related intrinsic ligands , including HSPs Luo et al. , 2010b . In addition to TLRs , other groups of pattern recognition receptors may also be involved in the immunostimu-latory signaling in glaucoma . For example , mannose-binding lec-tins , C-type lectins Tezel et al. , 2010 , and perhaps also C-reactive proteins Leibovitch et al. , 2005 although controversial Su et al. , 2007 , may promote innate immune activity with or without acti-vating the complement system . Taken together , various cellular events that are triggered in response to glaucomatous stress stimuli may serve as endogenous danger alarm signals to the immune system , thereby stimulating an immune response . However , it is currently unclear whether the immune activity evident in glaucoma patients is merely an epiphenomenon of the disease reflecting an intrinsic effort to facilitate tissue cleaning and healing , or whether it has any path-ogenic impact on neuronal injury . For example , autoantibodies and complement components may serve to opsonize the toxic cell debris , thereby facilitating their phagocytic removal as a necessary step towards promoting axon regeneration Vargas and Barres , 2007 . Nevertheless , growing evidence obtained using in vitro and in vivo models strongly suggests that any immune activity , if uncontrolled , may have destructive consequences contributing to the progression of neurodegenerative injury . In addition to innate cytotoxicity , cellular and humoral components of the adaptive immunity may also adversely affect neuronal survival . For example , autoreactive T cells may induce RGC apoptosis in culture mainly through Fas FasL signaling Wax et al. , 2008 . Regarding humoral immunity , HSP antibodies , when exogenously applied at concen-trations similar to detected in the glaucomatous patient serum , may be internalized by retinal neurons , co-localize with the native protein , and facilitate neuronal cell death in the isolated human retina Tezel and Wax , 2000a . Moreover , complement-mediated synapse elimination may become aberrantly reactivated in mouse glaucoma Stevens et al. , 2007 . Formation of the terminal membrane attack complex in human glaucoma Kuehn et al. , 2006 Tezel et al. , 2010 may also support the possibility of collateral cell lysis by uncontrolled complement activation . As an effort to better determine the pathogenic importance of immune system activity in glaucoma , ongoing research aims to produce animal models . Although many aspects remain unclear , initial findings of these studies support that the immunization of rats with HSPs can induce RGC loss in a topographically-specific pattern resembling human glaucoma Wax et al. , 2008 . Immuno-genic neuronal injury may also be induced by adoptive transfer using a rat model of experimental glaucoma Tezel et al. , 2008 . An interesting common observation of these studies using HSP immunization Wax et al. , 2008 or adoptive transfer Tezel et al. , 2008 is an early and transient T cell infiltration into the retina and optic nerve head . Seemingly contrary to observations in animal models , virtually no T cell invasion is evident in the glaucomatous human retina or optic nerve . Although previous studies have not specifically focused on T cell infiltration using the necessary labeling techniques , it should be emphasized that the lack of observations supporting a parenchymal T cell invasion in glaucomatous tissues is not a good argument against a pathogenic role of immune activity . This is because T cell invasion is a brief temporary event . However , depending on the nature of T cells , functional status of antigen-presenting cells , and the existing set of cytokines , chemokines and co-stimulatory molecules , even a small number of T cells can be sufficient to induce a massive cascade of events leading to neuro-degenerative injury Wekerle et al. , 1987 Odoardi et al. , 2007 . An immune-mediated component of the neurodegenerative injury in glaucoma is supported by a recent study that using immune defi-cient Rag1 knockout mice which lack mature B-and T-lymphocytes has provided robust neuroprotection when compared to wild-type controls in a mouse model of experimental glaucoma McKinnon et al. , 2010 . It is also important to highlight that despite the lack of clear evidence supporting classical hallmarks of inflammation in human glaucoma , continuous glial activation in the glaucomatous retina and optic nerve head may be sufficient to indicate an ongoing neuroinflammatory process . Such an adaptive response to tissue stress has been referred to as �para-inflammation� and implicated to contribute to the initiation and progression of aging-related neurodegenerative diseases Medzhitov , 2008 Xu et al. , 2009 . This type of inflammatory response that is intermediate between the basal homeostatic state and a classic inflammatory response is likely to be more common but of lower magnitude . While the physiological purpose of para-inflammation is to restore tissue homeostasis and functionality , it may become chronic or turn into overt destructive inflammation if tissue stress or cellular dysfunc-tion persists for a sustained period Medzhitov , 2008 Xu et al. , 2009 . Thus , despite limited evidence to support a definite pathogenic role for autoimmunity in glaucoma , current knowledge agrees with the neurodegenerative potential of uncontrolled immune activity . Present evidence collectively supports that innate immune cells , autoreactive T cells , autoantibodies , and excess complement attack all are potent stimuli to harm RGC somas , axons , and synapses Tezel and Wax , 2004 , 2007 Wax and Tezel , 2009 . The risk of developing autoimmune injury seemingly depends on co-existing risk factors , which include aging , chronic tissue stress and injury , efficiency of tissue cleaning , activity status of resident and systemic immune cells , and the ability to inhibit or activate T cell entry and activation . With an emphasis on the present evidence of such risk factors in glaucoma , a neurodegenerative process may possibly be stimulated through bystander autoreactive T cell activation as opposed to induction of regulatory T cells and protective immunity . As discussed in the next section , oxidative stress appears to be particularly important for fine tuning of the homoeostatic balance in glaucoma . Once the regulation of immune activity in glaucoma is better understood , immunomodulatory treatment strategies can be designed to manipulate the immune response towards enhanced tissue repair and function , while avoiding an autoimmune neuro-degenerative injury . 3 . Glaucoma-related and aging-related oxidative stress A number of cellular events triggered during glaucomatous neurodegeneration may result in conditions of oxidative stress when amplified production of reactive oxygen species exceeds antioxidant defenses Ko et al. , 2005 . Oxidative stress , due to mitochondrial dysfunction Tezel and Yang , 2004 Osborne , 2010 and perhaps also other mechanisms , has long been linked to pathogenic mechanisms by which elevated IOP-related or -unre-lated factors result in the neurodegenerative injury to RGCs and their axons in glaucoma Levin , 1999 Osborne , 2008 Kong et al. , 2009 . Oxidative stress is intimately linked with an integrated series of cellular phenomena , which all seem to contribute to further progression of glaucomatous neurodegeneration . For example , oxidative stress leads to oxidative damage to cellular macromolecules , such as DNA , proteins and lipids , and impairs the cellular redox balance Tezel et al. , 2005 . Oxidative stress may also trigger intracellular signaling pathways by acting as a second messenger and modulating protein function by redox modifications of downstream effectors Tezel , 2006 . Ongoing studies focused on the immunogenic aspects of glaucoma support that oxidative stress is also linked to immunostimulatory signaling as discussed in the next section Tezel , 2009 . Although neurons are prone to build up oxidative stress as implicated in many neurodegenerative diseases , there is also an aging-related component of the oxidative stress . While oxidative stress increases in aging brain , the intrinsic ability of cells to respond to oxidative damage declines with increasing age . Conse-quently , increased accumulation of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species produced from endogenous metabolic pathways is a main cause for the reduced ability of neurons to cope with stressful conditions in the elderly . Similarly , aging is a well recognized risk factor for the initiation and progression of glaucomatous neuro-degeneration Gordon et al. , 2002 Broman et al. , 2008 . In addition to an aging-related decline in optic nerve axon counts and function Mikelberg et al. , 1989 Repka and Quigley , 1989 Jonas et al. , 1992 , experimental studies using animal models of glaucoma also demonstrate increased susceptibility to neuronal injury with aging Wang et al. , 2007 . Thus , oxidative stress developing through the pathogenic cellular processes of glaucoma appears to be amplified by the aging-related oxidative stress . Enhanced accumulation of advanced glycation end-products AGEs in the glaucomatous retina and optic nerve head supports an accelerated aging process in glaucomatous eyes Tezel et al. , 2007a . Parallel to aging-related loss of neurons , glial cells exhibit remarkable alterations with increasing age . For example , aging-related alterations in glial extracellular matrix production Hernandez et al. , 1989 and biomechanics Burgoyne and Downs , 2008 have been proposed to account for the clinical behavior and increased susceptibility of the aged optic nerve head to glaucoma-tous damage . Existing evidence also supports the aging-related deterioration of microglia with implications for neurodegenerative diseases . Besides aging-related alterations in cytokine and chemo-kine profiles , growth factor production , and complement activation , the aging process also adversely affects the cellular viability and self-renewal capacity resulting in the generation of dysfunctional microglia Streit , 2006 . Aging can also cause a decline in immunocompetence and impair functional interactions thatoccur between the brain and the immune system . Aging of the immune system , referred to as immunose-nescence , appears to be closely related to chronic stress-related factors , mainly including the oxidative stress . The immune system cells show an increase in oxidant and inflammatory compounds and a parallel decrease in antioxidant defenses with aging Bauer et al. , 2009 Maue et al. , 2009 Panda et al. , 2009 . Oxidative stress and accumulation of oxidation products are considered to be major factors serving as local triggers for retinal para-inflammatory responses with aging and have been associated with the pathogen-esis of aging-related retinal diseases Xu et al. , 2009 . Paradoxically to this low-grade chronic inflammation , there is an aging-related decline in immune functions as characterized by a decrease in cell-mediated and humoral immune functions Bauer et al. , 2009 Maue et al. , 2009 Panda et al. , 2009 . This aging-related impairment is thought to cause increased vulnerability to infection , cancer , and autoimmune diseases with aging . One of the key roles of oxidative stress in cell aging mechanisms is dampening the telomerase activity leading to telomere shortening . Since the adaptive immune response relies on the ability of lymphocytes to undergo periodic massive expansion , aging-related decline in immune functions has been linked to critical roles of telomeres and telomerase in T cell differ-entiation and function Kaszubowska , 2008 . Despite seemingly contradicting aspects of the aging-related alterations in immune response , such as para-inflammation versus impaired immune functions , cumulative deterioration of regulatory mechanisms and functional interactions between the neurons , glia , and immune system cells during aging appear to be critically important . Potential mechanisms that contribute to increased autoimmune and or inflammatory responses with aging include epigenetic alterations , especially DNA methylation and histone acetylation Yung and Julius , 2008 Agrawal et al. , 2010 . Thus , oxidative stress besides cellular senescence is a major factor affecting normal cellular processes in the elderly , thereby leading to a cumulative deterioration with aging . Standing the hypothesis that oxidative stress favors immune processes inducing autoimmune and or inflammatory diseases , glaucomatous tissue stress along with the aging-related factors may lead to the loss of physiological homeostasis and create an environment that is permissive to immunogenic neurodegenerative injury . Experimental studies aiming to illuminate immunogenic aspects of glaucoma support that besides inducing neuronal injury , oxidative stress-related events may also alter the regulation of immune response in many different ways . One of these events is oxidative protein modifications as detected by proteomic analysis of the retina in experimental glaucoma Tezel et al. , 2005 . Oxida-tion may change the antigenic features of these proteins , thereby serving as an immunostimulatory signal during glaucomatous neurodegeneration . Rosario Hernandez�s work has indicated that during the transition of quiescent astrocytes to reactive phenotype altered astrocyte homeostatic functions include the release of antioxidant enzymes to counteract the cytotoxic effects of oxidative stress Malone and Hernandez , 2007 Hernandez et al. , 2008 . Despite the activation of antioxidant mechanisms however , not only RGCs , but also glial cells exhibit the evidence of protein and lipid oxidation in experimental glaucoma Tezel et al. , 2005 Govindarajan et al. , 2009 . Thus , in addition to increasing anti-genity , oxidative modifications may also affect the neurosupportive and immunoregulatory functions of glial cells . Oxidized proteins , lipids , and DNA become para-inflammatory stimuli and signal to resident immune cells , mainly including microglia , to initiate an innate immune response Xu et al. , 2009 . With enhanced scavenger functions , microglial cells are able to remove oxidation products by phagocytosis . In the meantime , they may release growth factors and cytokines to promote tissue healing Schwartz , 2003a Ransohoff and Perry , 2009 . This is in the same notion proposed for regulatory T cells Schwartz and Kipnis , 2002 . However , if oxidative stress reaches to a certain level , the physio-logical homeostasis may be impaired , thereby evolving into an injury process . In this case , initial glial response expands and leads to increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines . Relevant to human glaucoma , TNF-a is a major pro-inflammatory cytokine regulated by a redox-sensitive transcription factor , nuclear factor-kappa-B Tezel et al. , 2001 . Another consequence of this cascade of events is the induction of inflammatory enzymes , such as inducible nitric oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase-2 , also evident in human glaucoma Neufeld et al. , 1997 Liu and Neufeld , 2000 . Complement activation constitutes another important compo-nent of the innate immune activities detected in glaucomatous human donor eyes Kuehn et al. , 2006 Stasi et al. , 2006 Tezel et al. , 2010 . Although complement activation serves as a tissue cleaning process , uncontrolled complement activation may also accelerate the neurodegenerative injury through cell lysis . Interestingly , oxidative stress has recently been shown to also modulate complement regulation by down-regulating an important complement regulatory molecule Tezel et al. , 2010 . Other consequences of oxidative stress facilitating an aberrant immune activity in glaucoma include the augmented generation of AGEs through oxidative stress-dependent processes Tezel et al. , 2007a . AGEs may act as persistent antigenic stimulus and also be immunostimulatory through a specific receptor RAGE -mediated signaling that leads to pro-inflammatory cytokine production Lin , 2006 . Finally , oxidative stress that provides a common trigger for many downstream pathways compromising the perivascular barrier function Pun et al. , 2009 may similarly affect blood vessels in human glaucoma Feilchenfeld et al. , 2008 . Regarding the role of oxidative stress in adaptive immune responses , a recent in vitro study has revealed that oxidative stress stimulates antigen presentation to T cells by up-regulating glial MHC class II expression and cytokine production . Findings of this experimental study also support that reactive oxygen species act as co-stimulatory molecules during antigen presentation Tezel et al. , 2007b . In addition , up-regulated expression of glial TLRs and specific signaling molecules in the glaucomatous human retina supports their involvement in innate and adaptive immune responses in glaucoma . Based on in vitro findings , oxidation products similar to stress proteins may function as intrinsic ligands of the TLR signaling in glaucoma , thereby leading to T cell stimu-lation Luo et al. , 2010b . Ongoing experimental studies provide supportive evidence that the immunoreactivity of the glaucoma-tous patient sera against oxidatively stressed retinal cell culture proteins is greater than the immunoreactivity of the same sera to control retinal proteins Luo et al. , 2010a . 5 . Concluding remarks There is no doubt that the immune system functions for neuronal maintenance and repair . But , alterations in the immune system regulation due to accumulating risk factors may shift the physiological equilibrium and switch the protective immunity into a neuroinflammatory degenerative process over a chronic and cumulative period Fig. 1 . Oxidative stress developing through the pathogenic cellular processes of glaucoma , along with the aging-related oxidative stress , appears to contribute to altered regulation of immune response in glaucoma . Thus , elevated IOP-related factors can initiate neurodegenera-tive injury in glaucomatous eyes , but seems to be only a small aspect of the big picture . A complex interplay of cellular events , including glial activation dysfunction , mitochondrial dysfunction oxidative stress , and immune response , may also amplify the primary injury process and contribute to disease progression . Oxidative stress is a major component of this cycle of cellular events . IOP-dependent versus IOP-independent components of these injurious events are likely determined by a number of indi-vidual susceptibility factors Fig. 2 . Future studies should deter-mine whether therapeutic inhibition of oxidative stress may act to break the cycle of events leading to neurodegenerative injury in glaucoma . In summary , the proposed unifying scheme of multiple cellular processes integrates different risk factors , including neurodegen-erative insults , glial activation response , aging , and oxidative stress , with the altered regulation of immune response in glaucoma . Based on the view that alterations in the regulation of immune response have important impacts in glaucomatous neurodegeneration , an improved understanding of the regulatory mechanisms can help therapeutic modulation of the immune response to restore tissue homeostasis in the retina and optic nerve . Ongoing studies with the advent of refined experimental models and emerging sophisticated analysis techniques promise to expand the current knowledge and offer new treatment possibilities for glaucoma patients .

Consequently , understanding the mechanisms regulating adipocyte differentiation may provide valuable information in limiting obesity and its pathological consequences . The 3T3-L1 cell line has been widely used as adipogenesis model to elucidate the mechanism of adipocyte differentiation , in which confluent 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes differentiate into adipocytes upon exposure to a hormone cocktail including isobutylmethylxanthine , dexamethasone and insulin MDI .3,4 A number of transcription factors are involved in the regulation of adipogenesis , including the peroxisome proli-ferator-activated receptor PPAR family5�7 and CCAAT enhancer-binding proteins.8,9 PPARg is a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily , and is both necessary and sufficient for adipogenesis.10 PPARg1 and PPARg2 are generated by alternative splicing and promoter usage and induced during adipogenesis . PPARg1 is found in other cell types besides adipocytes , whereas PPARg2 is expressed specifically in adipocytes.11 In 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes , a hormonal adipogenic stimulus induces a transient increase in the expression of C EBPb and C EBPd , 12 which then stimulates cell proliferation and expression of PPARg2 and C EBPa . Once activated , PPARg2 and C EBPa can cross-regulate one another to maintain their expression and other adipogenic factors in mature adipocyte.13 Kruppel-like � factors KLFs are members of an emerging family of DNA-binding transcriptional regulators with crucial roles in development , differentiation and a number of other physiological cellular processes.14 The members of this protein family contain three C2H2 zinc fingers near their C-terminus , which recognize CACCC and related GC-rich elements in promoters and enhancers , and their N-terminal domains are highly variable and show different molecular functions.14 Previous reports showed that KLF proteins had different expression patterns during adipogenesis and several KLFs had been proved to either promote or inhibit this process.15�21 Kruppel-like � factor 9 KLF9 , previously designated as basic transcription element-binding protein-1 BTEB1 , was initially isolated from a rat liver cDNA library.22 KLF9 was further identified to be important for development and other physiological functions . For example , female mice null for the Klf9 gene show some defects such as uterine growth retarda-tion , fewer numbers of embryo implantation sites and decreased litter size.23 KLF9 could control intestinal crypt cell proliferation and villus cell migration.24 In addition , KLF9 is required for proper maturation of the central nervous system.25 Furthermore , KLF9 may function at the node of progesterone receptor and estrogen receptor genomic pathways to influence cell proliferation.26 In our previous study with mouse oligonucleotide microarray , it was identified that the expression of Klf9 was induced during 3T3-L1 adipocyte differentiation . In the present study , we found that KLF9 functioned in adipocyte differentiation through transacti - vating PPARg2 . Results The expression of KLF9 increases at the middle stage of adipogenesis . To detect whether KLF9 was related to adipogenesis , we isolated rat primary pre-adipocytes and induced these cells for differentiation . Western blot analysis showed that the protein level of KLF9 was elevated in adipocytes , but undetectable in pre-adipocytes Figure 1a . As expected , the expression levels of other adipocyte-specific proteins such as PPARg and aP2 were also greatly increased in adipocytes4 Figure 1a . As 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes have been widely used as an in vitro model for adipogenesis , we analyzed the expression of KLF9 during 3T3-L1 cell differentiation induced by the standard hormone cocktail MDI.3,4 Real-time PCR analysis showed that the KLF9 mRNA significantly increased from day 4 of the MDI induction , reaching a maximum at day 7 Figure 1b . As expected , the mRNA levels of other adipo-genesis-specific marker genes such as PPARg , C EBPa , Adiponectin and aP2 also increased during the process of 3T3-L1 cell differentiation Figure 1b . Furthermore , western blot analysis showed that the KLF9 protein was first clearly detected at day 4 after the MDI induction and continuously increased during the process of adipogen-esis , whereas this protein was undetectable in 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes Figure 1c . The expression pattern of KLF9 was similar to that of previously reported later transcription factors for adipogenesis such as C EBPa and PPARg , 27 but different from that of early transcription factors such as C EBPb12 Figure 1c . In addition , the results determined by immuno-fluorescence staining and sub-cellular fractionation assays showed that KLF9 proteins mainly lied in the nucleus at day 4 of adipogenesis , whereas a portion of KLF9 proteins was detected in the cytosol fraction at day 8 Supplementary Figure 1 . To find out if overexpression of KLF9 at the early stage had any effect on adipocyte differentiation , we forced exogenous KLF9 expression in 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes , and then induced the cells for adipogenesis with MDI . The results showed that KLF9 overexpression at the early stage of adipogenesis did not upregulate the expression level of C EBPa or PPARg Supplementary Figure 2 . It was not sufficient for the initiation of adipogenesis . KLF9 functions in adipogenesis at the middle stage of 3T3-L1 adipocyte differentiation . To address the function of KLF9 in adipogenesis , we established five stable cell lines containing different small interference RNA siRNA sequences against KLF9 see Materials and Methods . The results showed that KLF9 was knocked down at both the mRNA and the protein level in these stable cell lines with or without the MDI induction Figure 2a and b . Importantly , the results determined by Oil-red-O staining assay indicated that KLF9 knockdown by RNA interference RNAi suppressed adipocyte differentiation Figure 2c , suggesting that KLF9 is essential for adipogenesis . We further analyzed the expressions of adipocyte-specific markers in two KLF9-knockdown cell lines . Real-time PCR analysis showed that the mRNA expression levels of PPARg , C EBPa and aP2 were inhibited in these cells Figure 2d . In agreement with the mRNA results , the western blot results indicated downregulation of these adipogenic protein markers Figure 2e . Conversely , the mRNA levels of early transcrip-tion factors of adipogenesis , including C EBPb , C EBPd , KLF5 and Krox20 , did not show significant changes in these KLF9-knockdown cells , compared with that of the control cells Supplementary Figure 3 , suggesting that KLF9 does not function at the early stage of adipogenesis . Taken together , these results indicate that KLF9 is required for adipocyte differentiation and the time frame of its function is at the middle stage of adipogenesis , which is in accordance with the expression pattern of KLF9 during the process of adipocyte differentiation Figure 1 . To find out if differences in C EBPa and PPARg expression between the normal and KLF9-knockdown cell lines resulted from variations in mRNA stability , we analyzed the effects of KLF9 knockdown on the mRNA stability for PPARg and C EBPa . As shown in Supplementary Figure 4 , there was no significant difference in the mRNA stability for PPARg and C EBPa among the control and KLF9-knockdown cells , suggesting that downregulation of C EBPa or PPARg mRNAs in the KLF9-knockdown cells results from transcriptional suppression rather than reduction of mRNA stability . KLF9 could transactivate PPARc2 . As a transcription factor , what kind of target gene s KLF9 might regulate ? As shown in Supplementary Figure 3 , downregulation of KLF9 did not affect the expression of early adipogenic factors . In addition , downregulation of KLF9 also did not influence the expression of some inhibitory factors such as DLK1 , CHOP10 , KLF2 or GATA211 data not shown . In consi-deration of the time frame of its expression , we proposed three adipogenic transcription factors , C EBPb , C EBPa and PPARg2 , as potential KLF9 targets during the process of adipogenesis . Bioinformatics analysis showed that each of the three promoters , including 3.0 kb of the C EBPb promoter , 1.5 kb of the C EBPa promoter and 3.2 kb of the PPARg2 promoter , had many potential binding sites for KLF9 Figure 3a . To identify the KLF9-targeted promoter s from these three candidates , we co-transfected HEK293 cells with a plasmid expressing myc-tagged KLF9 protein and a luciferase reporter plasmid containing C EBPa , or C EBPb or PPARg2 promo - ters , respectively . The results showed that KLF9 could activate the PPARg2 promoter Figure 3d , whereas no such effect was detected on the promoters of C EBPa or C EBPb Figure 3b and c , suggesting that PPARg2 was the downstream target of KLF9 . The small proximal promoter region of PPARc2 is suffi-cient for KLF9 binding and transactivating activity . To identify the PPARg2 promoter region responsible for KLF9 transactivation , we analyzed the activity of the PPARg2 promoter in detail by generating a series of 50 deletions 0.6 , 1.3 , 2.1 kb within the 3.2-kb fragment Figure 4a , upper panel . The Figure 4b showed that 0.6-kb promoter of PPARg2 had similar activity as the 1.3-kb , or the 2.1-kb , and even the total 3.2-kb promoter in response to KLF9 activation in HEK293 cells , which was also confirmed in the NIH3T3 cell line Supplementary Figure 5a . These results suggest that the 0.6-kb proximal promoter region of PPARg2 is sufficient to drive the gene expression by KLF9 . Sequence analysis of the 0.6-Kb PPARg2 promoter predicted two possible KLF9-binding sites at 304 and 119 bp , respectively Figure 4a , upper panel . To verify if these two DNA fragments of PPARg2 promoter are respon-sible for KLF9 activation , we separately mutated the two sites Figure 4a , mutI and mutII and then analyzed the activity of these two mutated PPARg2 promoters by luciferase report assay . The results showed that either mutant significantly reduced the transcription activity induced by KLF9 in HEK293 cells Figure 4c , which was also confirmed in the NIH3T3 cell line Supplementary Figure 5b , suggesting that these two KLF9 binding sites are both functionally important . To test whether KLF9 could directly bind to the PPARg2 promoter , electrophoretic mobility-shift assays EMSAs were performed to analyze these two binding sites of the PPARg2 promoter see Materials and Methods . Results showed that the complexes formed in vitro by GST-KLF9 with labeled binding sites I and II , respectively , could be greatly decreased or diminished by excess cold DNA probes Figure 5a , compare lane 3 and 4 , and lane 10�l1 , whereas cold mutant probes did not have the same effect on these complexes Figure 5a , compare lane 3�5 , and lane 10�12 . In addition , these complexes could be super-shifted by an anti-myc monoclonal antibody directed to the fused protein Figure 5a , compare lane 3�7 , and lane 10�l4 , confirming the specificity of the DNA sequences binding to KLF9 . Collectively , these results indicate there is specific interaction between KLF9 and the PPARg2 promoter . To assess whether KLF9 could bind specifically to the PPARg2 promoter during adipogenesis , we analyzed the binding activity of KLF9 to the endogenous PPARg2 promoter in 3T3-L1 cells by chromatin immunoprecipitation ChIP assays see Materials and Methods . ChIP results showed that significant KLF9 binding to the 413 to 247 region of the PPARg2 promoter was detected at day 4 after MDI induction Figure 5b , left panel Supplementary Table S1 . As positive control , C EBPa binding to the same promoter region was detectable at day 4 and peaked at day 8 Figure 5b , left panel . As negative control , neither C EBPa nor KLF9 could bind to the 2000-bp region of the PPARg2 promoter Figure 5b , right panel Supplementary Table S1 , which is in agreement with previous report that C EBPa does not bind to the distal region of the PPARg2 promoter , 28 and our observation that KLF9 binds to the 0.6-kb proximal promoter region of PPARg2 Figure 4 . Taken together , the results indicate that KLF9 could directly bind to the promoter region of PPARg2 at the middle stage of 3T3-L1 adipocyte differentiation . KLF9 acts in concert with C EBPa to transactivate the PPARc2 promoter . We realized that KLF9 itself stimulated modest PPARg2 promoter activity in reporter assays Figure 3d , and KLF9 knockdown partially inhibited the expression of PPARg Figure 2d . These results imply that KLF9 might interact with other transcription factor s to synergistically activate PPARg2 like its family members , KLF518 and KLF15.21 The result detected by the luciferase report assay showed that when KLF9 was co-transfected with C EBPa , the two factors acted in concert to more strongly transactivate the PPARg2 promoter Figure 6a . Furthermore , the result of Oil-red-O staining at day 4 of MDI-induced adipocyte differentiation showed that inhibition of C EBPa expression with a chemically synthetic siRNA oligo in the KLF9-knockdown cells impaired adipogenesis more significantly than that of the KLF9 knockdown Ri-1 alone or C EBPa-siRNA si-348 alone Figure 6b and Supplementary Figure 6 . In addition , the results of real-time PCR and western blot showed that PPARg expression was further inhibited when expression of C EBPa was repressed in the KLF9-knockdown cells Figure 6c and d . Taken together , these results indicate that KLF9 should act in concert with C EBPa to efficiently transactivate the PPARg2 promoter . KLF9 physically interacts with C EBPa . We further analyzed whether the synergistic activating effect of KLF9 and C EBPa on the PPARg2 promoter was due to physical interaction between these two proteins . We ectopically expressed KLF9 and C EBPa in HEK293 cells and then detected the proteins by co-immunoprecipitation assays . The results showed there might be a physical interaction between KLF9 and C EBPa Figure 7a . To further confirm this observation , we purified the fusion proteins GST-KLF9 and GST-C EBPa , and then incubated these two proteins with lysates of HEK293 cells overexpressing C EBPa or KLF9 , respectively see Materials and Methods . The results detected by GST pull-down assay showed that the C EBPa proteins in the cell lysate could be pulled down in the presence of the GST-KLF9 proteins Figure 7b , left panel , whereas KLF9 in the cell lysate could be pulled down in the presence of GST-C EBPa Figure 7b , right panel . Taken together , these results indicate there is physical interaction between KLF9 and C EBPa . To further identify the local region s of KLF9 responsible for its interaction with C EBPa , we constructed six GST-fused truncated fragments of KLF9 , which were subjected to GST pull-down analysis . The results showed that the C EBPa-interaction domain of KLF9 lied in the region from amino acid 143 to 225 Figure 7c . Conversely , to identify the C EBPa domain interacting with KLF9 , we constructed two GST-fused truncated fragments of C EBPa and then applied the same GST pull-down assay . The results showed that the C EBPa domain responsible for interaction with KLF9 localized between amino acid 1 and 110 of C EBPa Figure 7d . Ectopic expression of PPARc2 rescues the impairment of adipogenesis in KLF9-knockdown 3T3-L1 cells . As these results indicate that KLF9 transactivates PPARg2 , we expected that overexpression of PPARg2 could reverse the defect in adipogenesis due to KLF9 deficiency . To test this hypothesis , we infected the stable cell line of KLF9 knockdown with a retrovirus encoding PPARg2 . Real-time PCR assay confirmed both siRNA-mediated knockdown of endogenous KLF9 expression and ectopic expression of PPARg2 in this cell line Figure 8a , and western blot analysis showed overexpression of PPARg2 before day 0 and after day 8 MDI induction Figure 8b . These cells were subjected to adipocyte differentiation and detected by Oil-red-O staining assay . The results showed that ectopic PPARg2 expression rescued the impairment of adipogenesis caused by KLF9 knockdown Figure 8c . Furthermore , real-time PCR analysis showed that the mRNA levels of PPARg , C EBPa and aP2 in these KLF9-knockdown cells expressing ectopic PPARg2 were recovered Figure 8d . In agreement with the mRNA results , the western blot results indicated recovery of protein levels of these adipogenic markers Figure 8e . Collectively , these results support the conclusion that KLF9 involves in adipogenesis regulation by transactivating PPARg2 . The dynamic changes of the sub-cellular localization and activities of KLF9 during the process of 3T3-L1 adipocyte differentiation . In this study , we showed that KLF9 expression at both the mRNA and protein level continuously increased during adipocyte differentiation Figure 1b and c , whereas expression of PPARg increased from day 2 to day 6 Figure 1b , indicating that the expression pattern of KLF9 and PPARg during the differentiation is not completely parallel . This phenomenon could be explained as follows First , we showed that KLF9 acted in concert with C EBPa to more strongly transactivate the PPARg2 promoter Figure 6a . In fact , the expression profile of C EBPa is quite similar to that of PPARg Figure 1b . Secondly , although KLF9 protein level was much higher at day 8 than that at day 4 during the MDI-induced different-iation , KLF9 no longer bound to the PPARg2 promoter , as shown by ChIP Figure 5b , and a great part of KLF9 existed in the cytoplasm , as shown by immunofluorescence and sub-cellular fractionation analysis Supplementary Figure 1 . We speculate that post-translational modifications might be involved in KLF9�s sub-cellular localization and function . Post-translational modifications are widely used by transcription factors to regulate their sub-cellular localizations and acti-vities.29 Several KLFs were reported to be phosphorylated and their transcriptional activities were changed by the modifications.30�32 We found that when several serines on the KLF9 protein were mutated to alanines , its transcriptional activities detected by luciferase report assay for the PPARg2 promoter were greatly enhanced unpublished data . How-ever , whether post-translational modifications really hap-pened to endogenous KLF9 in adipogenesis needs to be further investigated . The relationship between KLF9 and other trans-cription factors for binding to the PPARc2 promoter . Downregulation of KLF9 by retrovirus-mediated RNAi impaired adipocyte differentiation , indicating that KLF9 is required for this process . However , ectopic KLF9 over-expression in 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes had no obvious promotions on PPARg or C EBPa expression at the early stages of differentiation Supplementary Figure 2 . Our results are in agreement with a previous report that KLF9 overexpression does not lead to lipid accumulation in NIH3T3 cells.21 The results from KLF9 overexpression and knockdown assays suggest that KLF9 is required but not sufficient to perform a full program of adipocyte differentiation . The present works showed that KLF9 transactivated PPARg2 at the middle stage of adipocyte differentiation by directly binding to the PPARg2 promoter Figure 5 . However , overexpression of KLF9 in 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes did not lead to upregulation of PPARg at the early stage of differentiation Supplementary Figure 2 , which suggests that the time of KLF9 upregulation is important for its function . We speculate that the cellular environment such as the expression levels of other transcription factors might be important for KLF9�s function . Because of the high similarity in their DNA-binding zinc fingers , many KLFs bind to very similar consensus sites , such as CACCC boxes.14 In fact , it is widely reported that different members of the KLF family may compete for the consensus sites of the promoter regions , perhaps due to similarity in their recognition sequences.33�37 For example , KLF5 could abrogate the activating effect of KLF4 on the Klf4 promoter , whereas KLF4 could abrogate the inhibiting effect of KLF5 on the same promoter , and it was speculated that this competing effect was due to physical competition of the two proteins for binding to a cognate DNA sequence.36 In another report , KLF9 competed with Sp1 for the BTE sequence in the cytochrome P4501A1 promoter.34 Importantly , a previous work identified that KLF2 bound to a GC box at the proximal region of the PPARg2 promoter in pre-adipocytes and at the early stage of differentiation , 15 which is just the KLF9-binding site-II identified in the present experi-ment Figures 4 and 5 . Thus , it is reasonable to speculate that the endogenous KLF2 binds to this specific region on the PPARg2 promoter in pre-adipocytes , which made the PPARg2 promoter unavailable for the ectopic KLF9 proteins . To test this possibility , we performed an in vitro competition transac-tivation assay for KLF9 and KLF2 . As shown in Figure 3 and Supplementary Figure 7 , KLF9 itself modestly upregulated transcription from the PPARg2 promoter . This effect could be counteracted by expression of KLF2 , and the inhibitory efficiency depends on the extent of KLF2 expression , which indicates that KLF2 and KLF9 compete for the same binding site on the PPARg2 promoter . We noticed that a small quantity of KLF2 was enough to abolish KLF9�s transactivating activity to basal level , and KLF2�s repression effects on PPARg2 promoter could hardly be reversed by increasing amounts of KLF9 Supplementary Figure 7 , which indicates that the binding affinity of KLF2 to the PPARg2 promoter is higher than that of KLF9 . So , it is reasonable to speculate that the exogenous KLF9 in pre-adipocytes may not be able to replace the endogenous KLF2 , which already exists on the PPARg2 promoter . In addition , other inhibitory factors existing on the PPARg2 promoter before differentiation could also impede KLF9 to bind to the promoter.38 For example , GATA2 and GATA3 are two transcription factors , which are abundant in pre-adipocytes and their expressions decline after differentia-tion.38 Both proteins were reported to bind to the PPARg2 promoter and their binding site was just 13 bp upstream from the KLF9�s binding site-II , which may also impede KLF9�s binding.38 The roles and relationships among the members of the KLF family during adipogenesis . Our present results and previous works have shown that four members of the KLF family have roles in adipocyte differentiation by regulating PPARg2 transcription.15,18,21 These KLFs are expressed sequentially during adipogenesis . KLF2 is first expressed in 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes and its expression is shut down after differentiation.15 Then , KLF5 is induced 4 h after MDI induction and its expression peaks at the early stage of adipocyte differentiation.18 The expression of KLF9 appears at the middle stage of differentiation and gradually increases throughout the middle and late stages Figure 1 . In addition , KLF15�s expression pattern mimics KLF9 and is highly expressed in mature adipocytes.21 These KLFs carry out their respective functions by binding to the PPARg2 promoter either to open up or to shut down its transcription . While the time frame for each KLF binding is different , the DNA elements they bind to are the same.15,18 These KLFs bind to one or both of the DNA elements within the 0.6-kb PPARg2 upstream promoter region , 15,18 except for KLF15 , whose binding target on PPARg2 promoter has not been identified.21 We also found that KLF9 and C EBPa have physical interactions and they can synergistically activate the PPARg2 promoter Figure 6 and 7 . This observation is coincident with previous reports that KLF5 and C EBPb d interact directly and they colocalize on the PPARg2 promoter on day 2.5 of differentiation , 18 and KLF15 cooperates with C EBPa to synergistically activate the PPARg2 promoter at the late stages.21 Synergistic activation of the PPARg2 promoter by these factors and their physical interactions suggest that these molecules may form an enhanceosome , 18,39,40 and different enhanceosomes are formed at different stages . Obesity has been closely related to a series of human health problems such as diabetes . Adipocyte differentiation is one of the direct causes of adipose formation in vivo.41 Our finding adds a new member of the KLF family related to adipocyte differentiation and places KLF9 into a group of key pro-adipogenic transcription factors . The dissection of the mechanisms controlling KLF9 expression could lead to further identification of the mechanism that control adipogenesis , which would provide new clues against the growing incidence of obesity in the modern world .

20725088	The human Ret finger protein-like hRFPL 1,2,3 genes OMIM 605968 , 605969 , 605970 are recently identified targets of Pax6 , which is notably a key transcription factor for pancreas , eye and neocortex development.1�3 In this line , high hRFPL1,2,3 expression is found at the onset of neurogenesis in differentiating embryonic stem cells and in the developing neocortex.4 In addition , the study of RFPL1,2,3 evolutionary history revealed that they are only found in Old World monkeys and great apes and show features believed to be important for human brain evolution.4 Yet , the cellular activity of RFPL1,2,3 is still unknown . A murine RFPL mRFPL protein , encoded by an ancestral gene not belonging to the RFPL1,2,3 gene subfamily , 4 has also been cloned.5 Previously reported as being expressed only in testis , ovaries and oocytes , 5,6 mRFPL has been shown to interact with the destruction box motif of cyclin B1 � the Cdc2 activating partner for driving germ cells through metaphases I and II7� and with proteins of the proteasome , speculating on mRFPL ability to elicit cyclin B1 degradation to control meiosis progression.6 However , the fact that cyclin B1 and Cdc2 also form a key complex for controlling cell entry into mitosis8 and our recent observations that the RFPL genes are also expressed in tissues in which cells divide mitotically4 suggest that the RFPL proteins could regulate other aspects of cell division . We therefore examined RFPL-mediated control of mitotic cell-cycle progression by focusing on hRFPL1 . Because no endogenously hRFPL1-expressing cell type suitable for this kind of study has been reported to date , we examined the www.nature.com cdd influence of hRFPL1 gain of function on HeLa cells , a reference cell system for examining cell-cycle regulation . We report that hRFPL1 is an antiproliferative gene that controls G2�M phase transition , thereby lengthens G2 phase by reducing cyclin B1 and Cdc2 accumulation . Accordingly , in Pax6-expressing cells to elicit endogenous hRFPL1 expres-sion , we observed decreased cyclin B1 and Cdc2 levels that were prevented by hRFPL1 RNA interference , confirming that the control of cyclin B1 and Cdc2 levels is a physiologically relevant function of the endogenous hRFPL1 protein . Results hRFPL1 expression level can be enhanced by p53 . We previously reported that Pax6 binds to the hRFPL1 promoter and elicits its transcription , 4 but also induces p53 activation and nuclear translocation.9 p53 is an important transcription factor for the control of cell-cycle progression and apoptosis . Given the possible role of hRFPL1 on cell-cycle and in silico prediction of putative p53 binding sites on its promoter , we examined the influence of p53 on hRFPL1 transcriptional regulation . Upon Pax6-elicited hRFPL1 expression and p53 activation in HeLa cells , 4,9 we observed using chromatin immunoprecipitation ChIP that p53 interacted in vivo with hRFPL1 promoter Figure 1a . After blocking p53 activity using either cyclic-Pifithrin-a , an inhibitor of p53 nuclear translocation10 or a p53 shRNA , 11,12 we observed that Pax6-induced hRFPL1 expression was significantly reduced transcript Normalized 0.4 *** ? ? DMSO DMSO shRNA shRNA shRNA shRNA cPFT cPFT CDKN1A promoter Altogether , these data indicate that Pax6-mediated regulation of hRFPL1 expression is cell dependent . Further , in HeLa cells , p53 activation downstream of Pax6 signaling allows its binding to the hRFPL1 promoter to enhance its transcriptional expression . hRFPL1 decreases cell number through its RDM and SPRY domains . To address the potential hRFPL1 role on cell cycle , we next examined the impact of hRFPL1 gain of function on cell number in HeLa cells . hRFPL1 significantly decreased cell number from day 2 after cell transduction Figure 2a . Such an effect was also observed following hRFPL1 gain of function in other human cell lines Supplementary Figure 1D , indicating that its effect was not restricted to specific cell types . Then , we performed a structure�function study by truncat-ing the different hRFPL1 protein domains to determine those involved in this effect . In addition to its zf-C3HC4 RING-type zinc-finger domain and C-terminal PRY SPRY-forming B30.2 domain that are present in other proteins , hRFPL1 is also formed of an RFPL1,2,3-specifying helix RSH , which is an N-terminal a-helix loop restricted to the RFPL1,2,3 proteins , and of an RFPL-defining motif RDM , between the RING and the B30.2 domains , that is found exclusively in the RFPL proteins and predicted to form together with the RING domain a more complex zinc finger of the RING U-Box superfamily . We controlled by immunofluorescence that the deletion of either domain was not altering the localization of truncated , field number Cell hRFPL1 80 field 60 number 40 Cell 20 0 GFP length 1-29 30-64 65-124 64-124 148* 243* 125-176 177-317 125-317 Figure 2 hRFPL1 alters cell number increase over time . a Time course of HeLa cell number transduced with eGFP or hRFPL1 . ***Po0.001 compared with eGFP-expressing cells using two-way ANOVA followed by Tukey�s post hoc test . b Identification of protein domains involved in hRFPL1 effect on cell number 3 days after transduction .

Neither RSH , nor RING , nor PRY were involved in hRFPL1 effect on cell number Figure 2b . By contrast , we observed the implication of RDM and SPRY N-terminal part Figure 2b . Interestingly , hRFPL1 presents the rare feature of having two nonsense single nucleotide polymorphisms SNPs leading to premature stop codons R148* SNP rs16987628 Q243* SNP rs12484086 . Although the Q243* SNP did not alter hRFPL1 effect on cell number , the protein encoded by the R148* SNP sequence lost this effect Figure 2b . hRFPL1 reduces the number of mitotic events . To understand how hRFPL1 limits the increase in cell number over time , we determined the behavior of hRFPL1-expressing HeLa cells by performing quantitative live-cell Table 1 hRFPL1 reduces the number of mitotic events The different parameters were quantified during 48 h using live-cell imaging experiments in GFP-or hRFPL1-expressing HeLa cells . Apoptosis was defined by typical morphological changes cell shrinkage , blebbing . imaging studies . When considering only the cycling cells between 24 and 72 h after transduction , we observed that hRFPL1-expressing HeLa cells showed a decreased cell division rate . On the other hand , some cells showed defect in performing mitosis either they did not perform any during the recorded period or this event was not completed and some cells showed typical morphological changes of entry into apoptotic cell death cell shrinkage , blebbing Table 1 . Apoptosis was confirmed by quantitative immunocyto-chemistry 0.36�0.36 % of GFP-positive cells were immunoreactive for cleaved caspase-3 versus 32.8�4.0 % of hRFPL1-transduced cells , Po0.001 , similar to the time-lapse video-imaging data . Thus , hRFPL1 decreases cell proliferation that may lead to apoptotic cell death . PKC and Cdc2 regulate hRFPL1 activity . To assess the specificity of hRFPL1 effect on cell proliferation and apoptosis , we assessed the influence of kinase-dependent post-translational mechanisms on hRFPL1 activity following in silico identification of putative PKC S200 and Cdc2 S287 phosphorylation sites . In accordance with these predictions , we observed that FLAG-tagged hRFPL1 was present in the purified fraction of phospho-proteins from HeLa cells Figure 3a , and that the levels of phospho-hRFPL1 were reduced when the cells were treated with Go6983 , � a PKCa b g inhibitor , or the Cdc2 inhibitor Figure 3a Supplementary Figure 1F . Interestingly , Go6983 � also prevented Pax6-elicited hRFPL1 expression but not the Cdc2 inhibitor Figure 3b , suggesting that the influence of the PKC pathway was not limited to controlling hRFPL1 phosphorylation status , but was also involved in Pax6 signaling mediating hRFPL1 transcription . Concerning PKC implication on hRFPL1 post-translational regulation , we observed that radiolabeled ATP incorporation in hRFPL1 using an in vitro PKCa b g kinase assay was significantly decreased in the S200A mutant in comparison to wild-type hRFPL1 Figure 3c . Further , the loss of S200 residue S200A mutant reversed hRFPL1-mediated reduction in cell number Figure 3e and caspase 3 activation Figure 3f . At the opposite , mimicking permanent phosphory-lation on this residue S200E mutant led to effects similar to wild-type hRFPL1 Figure 3e and f . As for Cdc2 involvement , we observed that Cdc2 phosphorylated hRFPL1 S287 residue in an in vitro cyclin B1 Cdc2 kinase assay Figure 3d . The loss of this phosphorylation site S287G mutant did not alter 0 WT WT S200A S287G S200A S287G 40 Cleaved positive Cell 20 10 0 0 GFP WT GFP WT S200A S200E S287G S287E S200A S200E S287G S287E Figure 3 hRFPL1 activity is regulated by classical PKCs and Cdc2 . a Phosphorylation status of FLAG-tagged hRFPL1 was determined by purification of phosphoproteins versus extraction of whole cell lysates in HeLa cells treated with DMSO control , Cdc2 inhibitor or the PKCa b g inhibitor , Go6983 , � and immunoblotting using a FLAG antibody . b Influence of PKC and Cdc2 kinases on Pax6-elicited hRFPL1 expression was examined by quantitative PCR . *Po0.05 , ***Po0.001 versus eGFP DMSO-or # # # Po0.001 versus Pax6 DMSO-treated cells using one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey�s post hoc test . c , d Phosphorylation of hRFPL1 Ser200 and Ser287 residues was determined by in vitro PKC and cyclin B1 Cdc2 kinase assays . **Po0.01 , ***Po0.001 versus [ 32P ] ATP incorporation in wild-type WT hRFPL1 using one-way ANOVA followed by a Tukey�s post hoc test . e Comparison of the impact of wild-type WT or mutant hRFPL1 on HeLa cell number 3 days after transduction .

Altogether these data suggested that classical PKCs and Cdc2 exert opposite regulatory effects on hRFPL1 activity by promoting or preventing its effect on cell number , respectively . Further , these observations indicated that 1 hRFPL effect on cell proliferation in our gain-of-function approach is specific as it was reversed when regulatory post-translational sites were mutated and 2 apoptosis , which was also reversed with these mutations , may therefore be a consequence of hRFPL1 action on cell-cycle machinery , rather than a toxic , nonspecific effect due to protein overexpression even if we can not rule out that apoptosis could be less prominent if hRFPL1 expression level were closer to an endogenous one . hRFPL1 alters G2�M phase transition . From there , we investigated the influence of hRFPL1 on cell-cycle regulation . Using FACS analysis to examine the cell-cycle phase altered during hRFPL1 antiproliferative activity , we observed that hRFPL1 significantly increased the population of cycling cells in G2�M phase Figure 4a . We then examined the impact of hRFPL1 on the levels of proteins regulating cell-cycle progression cyclin D1 CDK6 regulating G1 phase progression , cyclin A CDK2 G1�S transition and cyclin B1 Cdc2 G2�M transition . In line with the data on cell-cycle analysis , hRFPL1 influence on cyclin CDK complexes was restricted to cyclin B1 and Cdc2 as it elicited a decrease in their protein levels Figure 4b Supplementary Figure 2A , whereas their transcriptional expression remained steady Figure 4c . We also examined the impact of hRFPL1 on other proteins associated with cell-cycle check point p53 and p21WAF1 CIP1 or known to regulate G2�M transition , namely cdc25C a Cdc2-activating phosphatase , PLK1 a cdc25C-activating kinase and Emi1 a F-Box protein required to induce M-phase entry by stimulating cyclin B1 accumulation . hRFPL1 did not alter the expression of any of these proteins , suggesting that it does not alter the p53 pathway , nor the complete machinery involved in G2�M phase transition , but preferentially regulates cyclin B1 and Cdc2 levels Figure 4b Supplementary Figure 2A . Further , both hRFPL1-mediated cyclin B1 and Cdc2 downregulations were precluded by MG-132 , a proteasome inhibitor Figure 4d Supplementary Figure 2B , suggesting that hRFPL1 reduces cyclin B1 and Cdc2 levels by triggering their ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation . In addition , neither S200A nor S287E hRFPL1 mutants led to cyclin B1 and Cdc2 downregulations Supplementary Figure 2C , in line with our observations that these mutations alter hRFPL1 ability to reduce cell number and induce apoptosis . We next examined the ability of endogenously expressed hRFPL1 to control levels of cyclin B1 and Cdc2 . Expression of Pax6 in HeLa cells elicited hRFPL1 expression and induced cyclin B1 and Cdc2 downregulation Figure 4e and f . Using RNA interference , we observed that Pax6-mediated hRFPL1 expression was significantly diminished with two of the three tested hRFPL1 siRNA sequences , which also significantly reversed effect of Pax6 on cyclin B1 and Cdc2 in a partial or total manner Figure 4e and f . Thus , it confirmed that the hRFPL1-mediated control of cyclin B1 and Cdc2 levels is physiologically relevant . We also observed that effect of hRFPL1 on cell number and on cyclin B1 and Cdc2 levels was shared by hRFPL2 , hRFPL3 and mRFPL Supplementary Figures 2D and 2E , indicating that this activity was conserved during the evolution of the RFPL gene family . hRFPL1 GFP p53 p21 actin hRFPL1 reduces the accumulation of cyclin B1 and Cdc2 during interphase . Using immunofluorescence and subcellular compartment fractionation followed by immuno-blotting , we detected that hRFPL1 was mostly localized in the cell cytoplasm Figure 5a and b , similar to cyclin B1 and Cdc2 subcellular localization during S and G2 phases.15 Thus , we hypothesized that hRFPL1 could alter cyclin B1 and Cdc2 accumulations during this period . To address this question , we synchronized HeLa cells in G1 phase cell population going from 47-18-35 to 71-18-11 % after mimosine treatment , in G1 , S and G2�M phase , respectively and examined by immunoblotting cyclin B1 and Cdc2 levels over time following release from cell-cycle block . Cyclin B1 accumulation was markedly decreased in hRFPL1-expressing cells as compared to GFP-transduced cells Figure 5c Supplementary Figure 2F . Changes in Cdc2 expression were less prominent during cell-cycle pro-gression , but its protein accumulation was also reduced in hRFPL1-expressing cells Figure 5c Supplementary Figure 2F . Hence , hRFPL1 alters cyclin B1 and Cdc2 protein levels by reducing their accumulation . Using quantitative immunofluorescence , we then examined whether this reduction was caused by a delayed onset of accumulation or a slower rate of accumulation . In normal conditions , cyclin B1 highly accumulates in the cytosol during interphase until a threshold concentration is reached to allow cyclin B1 Cdc2 activation and nuclear translocation , thereby cell entry into mitosis.16,17 We therefore focused on this component to compare its cytosolic and nuclear accumulation profile in hRFPL1-versus eGFP-expressing cells , following cell-cycle block release . The number of cells positive for cytosolic cyclin B1 increased following cell-cycle block release until it reached a plateau between 9 and 12 h . Both eGFP-and hRFPL1-expressing cells showed a similar kinetics Figure 5d , suggesting that the onset of cyclin B1 accumula-tion was not altered by hRFPL1 . Cyrosolic cyclin B1 sharply decreased at 15 h whereas we detected an augmentation in 100 % 80 cells 60 + B1 40 20 Cyclin the number of cells positive for nuclear cyclin B1 . However , the number of cells positive for nuclear cyclin B1 was significantly diminished in hRFPL1-expressing cells in com-parison to control cells Figure 5d , suggesting that hRFPL1 decreased cell entry into mitosis . Altogether , our kinetics experiments suggest that hRFPL1 decreases the rate of accumulation of cyclin B1 rather than its onset , and this possibly results in a delay in mitosis entry . hRFPL1 induces an increase in G2 phase length . We therefore investigated the impact of hRFPL1 on cell-cycle Table 2 hRFPL1 alters cell-cycle duration by increasing G2 phase length Cell-cycle GFP-expressing hRFPL1-expressing parameters cells h cells h deduced TG1 13.1 13.3 Length of the different cell-cycle phases were measured by EdU cumulative labeling TG1+TG2+TM , TS and TC and percentage of labeled mitosis TG2 and TM experiments in GFP-or hRFPL1-expressing HeLa cells . kinetics by assessing the duration of the different phases of the cell cycle . Using the cumulative 5-ethynyl-20-deoxyuridine EdU labeling approach to determine the duration of S phase and of total cell cycle , we observed that hRFPL1 gain of function lengthened the cell cycle by 2 h without modifying S-phase duration Figure 5e Table 2 . We then examined the percentage of labeled mitosis to measure the duration of G2 and M phases and thereby deduce G1 phase duration . Cells expressing hRFPL1 had a striking threefold increased G2 phase duration with no modification of M or G1 phase Figure 5f Table 2 . Thus , hRFPL1 alters cell-cycle kinetics by increasing G2 phase duration to elicit its antiproliferative activity . Discussion Cell-cycle regulation is a crucial and tightly regulated cellular mechanism involved in a wide range of biological processes . Here we show that hRFPL1 transcriptional level can be regulated downstream of Pax6 signaling by the prototypical cell-cycle-regulating p53 transcription factor in a cell-specific manner and hRFPL1 exerts a phosphorylation-dependent antiproliferative effect that is positively regulated by PKC and abrogated by Cdc2 . We further report that hRFPL1 controls G2�M phase transition by preventing the accumulation of cyclin B1 and Cdc2 proteins during interphase through a proteasome-dependent mechanism . Thus , such an activity lengthens G2 phase duration , which accumulates cell population in G2 phase and delays cell entry into mitosis . So far , little was known about the cellular activity of the RFPL proteins . The reported expression of the murine m RFPL in germ cells , its putative role as an E3 ubiquitin ligase based on its predicted secondary structure and its biochemical interaction with cyclin B1 as well as with HR6A , PMSB1 and ubiquitin B proteins of the proteasomal degrada-tion pathway led to the conclusion that it could regulate meiosis progression.5,6 However , the expression of RFPL genes in other tissues4 suggested that they could regulate other aspects of cell division . Upon gain of function in HeLa cells , we report here that hRFPL1 elicited cyclin B1 and Cdc2 downregulations that were precluded by a proteasome inhibitor , in line with the previous biochemical identification of mRFPL-interacting proteins.6 However , in contrast to the classical view that cyclin B1 degradation occurs during anaphase to allow mitosis exit and cell-cycle progression , 18 our study data indicate that hRFPL1 prevented the accumulation of cyclin B1 and its partner Cdc2 during interphase , leading to an antiproliferative activity by an increase in G2 phase duration , a cell accumulation in G2 phase and thus a delay of cell entry into mitosis . Despite our observations were primarily found in an hRFPL1-overexpressing cell system , we also observed , in a model where Pax6 directly induces hRFPL1 endogenous expression and elicits a decrease in cyclin B1 and Cdc2 levels , that the latter was prevented by hRFPL1 RNA interference , supporting the physiological relevance of this hRFPL1 activity . Given that these data were obtained following Pax6 gain of function , it is noteworthy that , in progenitor cells endogenously expressing Pax6 , the physio-logical levels of this latter are highly dynamic during cell-cycle progression , and an increase in Pax6 during G2 phase can notably occur to specify their differentiation.19 Increase in Pax6 levels , either physiological or ectopic , has been shown to direct cell-cycle exit and differentiation.19�21 Accordingly , we previously observed that ectopic Pax6 expression provoked a postmitotic G0 G1 cell-cycle arrest in HeLa cells.9 This was however not altered by hRFPL1 RNA interference data not shown , suggesting that hRFPL1 influence on cell-cycle progression is not sufficient to produce cell-cycle exit and differentiation in Pax6-expressing cells . Indirectly supporting the specificity of hRFPL1 cellular function , we also observed that hRFPL1 did not alter the protein levels of cyclins or CDKs controlling the progression of other cell-cycle phases , nor those of other regulators of G2�M phase transition . In respect with our data , it has been previously reported that cells failing to accumulate cyclin B1 have an increased cell population in G2 M phase due to an altered G2�M phase transition.22,23 Such a failure in cyclin B1 accumulation could rely on p53 activity22 or on interphasic activation of E3 ubiquitin protein ligases.23 We however did not find any change in the protein levels of p53 or of its canonical effector , p21WAF1 CIP1 . We also observed that the decreased cell proliferation elicited by hRFPL1 was accompanied by apoptotic cell death . Although apoptosis may be considered as a nonspecific , toxic effect of hRFPL1 overexpression , it is known that cyclin B1 inhibition , by arresting cells in G2 phase , leads to apopto-sis.24,25 Hence , hRFPL1-mediated cell death could be the consequence of its influence on cyclin B1 levels . The fact that Cdc2 levels were concomitantly regulated by hRFPL1 is also of importance . Indeed , Cdc2 is the most important CDK for cell-cycle regulation it is the only one controlling cell-cycle progression in simple eukaryotes26 and it has been shown in multiple knockout mice that Cdc2 is the only mandatory CDK to promote the mammalian cycle whereas the lack of other CDKs can be overcome by compensating mechanisms.27 This indicates that hRFPL1-mediated control of cell cycle through the regulation of Cdc2 protein level could not be overruled by other cyclin CDK-dependent processes , there-fore making it a very tight and precise mechanism . This also emphasizes the importance of Cdc2 regulation of hRFPL1 activity . Such a post-translational regulatory mechanism is traditionally described to pinpoint the oscillatory activity of proteins controlling cell-cycle progression.28 Accordingly , we propose that hRFPL1 activity would oscillate during cell-cycle progression to exert a finely tuned effect , first through a PKC-dependent phosphorylation allowing its activation during S and G2 phases to prevent cyclin B1 and Cdc2 accumulation . Then , a Cdc2-mediated phosphorylation would terminate hRFPL1 action , probably on M phase triggering cyclin B1 Cdc2 activation . Moreover , hRFPL1 regulation could reach another degree of complexity as we also observed that PKCs could be involved in Pax6 signaling mediating hRFPL1 transcription . Our observations also showed that hRFPL1 expression level could be regulated by a Pax6-dependent p53 activation . Pax6-mediated hRFPL1 expression appeared to be cell specific and could rely , among other hypotheses , on chromatin state of the hRFPL1 locus or on the presence of specific interacting partners . Although p53 could not transac-tivate hRFPL1 promoter in any tested cell line , it was able to enhance Pax6-elicited hRFPL1 levels in HeLa cells . Such an enhancing activity offers a first mechanistic hypothesis to support the previously reported importance of RFPL1,2,3 gene-dosage effect.4 It also suggests the involvement of other transcription factors or protein partners for recruiting p53 activity . Fitting with this hypothesis , it has been previously reported a transcriptional cooperation between p53 and a ligand-bound estrogen receptor to result in a regulatory cross talk synergistically transactivating VEGFR1 FLT1 , whereas p53 alone has relatively no effect.29,30 In addition , Pax6-downregulated FOXM1 and MCM5 genes were not affected by p53 RNA interference despite it has been reported in other cell systems that p53 could also repress their expression independently of Pax6 signaling.31,32 Thus , cross talk between Pax6 signaling and p53 activity appears to regulate specific genes in a given environment as the identification of either Pax6 or p53 target genes greatly varies depending on the cell system used.4,13,33�35 Although we observed that hRFPL1 impact on cell number and on cyclin B1 and Cdc2 levels was shared by hRFPL2 , hRFPL3 and mRFPL , indicating that this activity was con-served during the evolution of this gene family , it is noteworthy that such an activity involved the RDM domain . This RDM , present in all RFPL proteins but restricted to them , is the result of a neofunctionalization event that occurred after the emer-gence of the RFPL gene ancestor.4 Thus , RDM acquisition likely retained the functionality of the ancestral gene after its emergence by conferring it its antiproliferative activity . Further , RDM forms together with the RING domain a large zinc-finger structure of the RING U-Box superfamily . RING-containing proteins are known to exert an E3 ubiquitin protein ligase activity with the zinc-finger structure being mandatory for binding to the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme.36 Hence , our study data suggest that the C-terminal part of the RING-RDM-formed zinc finger is crucial for hRFPL1 antiproliferative activity , fitting with the concept that the RFPL proteins function as E3 ubiquitin protein ligases . Although this domain was crucial , it was not sufficient to exert any intrinsic effect as hRFPL1-mediated antiproliferation also relied on SPRY N-terminal part that has been reported to be the region in which cyclin B1 binds to mRFPL.6 Thus , SPRY would function as the recognition domain for proteasome-targeted substrates . In line with a possible influence of hRFPL1 on development and cell differentiation , it has been reported that hRFPL1 protein expression is induced during chemically mediated differentiation of human gastric carcinoma cells.36,37 We also detected a striking increase in hRFPL1 transcript level in differentiating human embryonic stem cells at the onset of neurogenesis , 4 during which regulation of cell-cycle lengthen-ing is a key event to trigger transition from proliferation to differentiation.38,39 The potential ability of hRFPL1 to trigger cell death is also of interest , as it has been reported that some cell-cycle regulators can elicit a key pro-apoptotic activity during diverse processes such as developmental morpho-genesis40 or tumor suppression.41 Thus , this report that the primate-restricted RFPL1 modulates G2�M phase transition could provide novel insights into understanding develop-mental changes over the course of evolution .

We also investigated the influence of p53 RNA interference on previously identified Pax6-regulated genes.13 Among the tested genes , only FOXM1 and MCM5 showed significant expression changes on Pax6 gain of function in HeLa cells . However , p53 RNA interference did not alter their Pax6-mediated regulation Supplementary Figure 1A , suggesting that the regulatory cross talk between Pax6 and p53 signaling pathways is restrained to specific genes . We next examined whether p53 could elicit hRFPL1 expression independently of Pax6 signaling . However , p53 overexpression or the use of the p53 inducer , doxorubicin , did not elicit hRFPL1 expression Figure 1c . By contrast , these two approaches increased TP53 expression and that of one of its downstream effectors , the CDKN1A target gene encoding p21WAF1 CIP1 Figure 1c . We therefore assessed p53 ability to bind to hRFPL1 promoter independently of Pax6 signaling using ChIP . p53 gain of function did not lead to its binding to hRFPL1 promoter , whereas it bound to that of CDKN1A Figure 1d . Given the reduced stability of p53 in HeLa cells due to human papilloma virus E6 protein , 14 we investigated whether ectopic p53 expression could elicit hRFPL1 expres-sion in other human cell lines presenting different p53 status . However , p53 overexpression did not induce hRFPL1 expression in HEK 293 , p53-deficient PC3 or SH-SY5Y cells whereas CDKN1A expression was augmented in all these cells Supplementary Figure 1B . Interestingly , Pax6 could not induce hRFPL1 expression in any of these other cell lines either Supplementary Figure 1C . 
20798686	Chemotherapy is a systemic treatment that destroys reprodu-cing cells , but it can not differentiate between normal and cancerous cells . Side effects occur when normal cells become damaged . Apart from the side effects of cancer chemo-therapy , unexpected �opposite effects� of chemotherapy , which enhance the critical steps in malignancy rather than inhibiting them , 1�3 have attracted progressively more atten-tion , suggesting that novel strategies should be developed to reverse these opposite effects and render chemotherapy more effective . Tumor cells progress from non-invasive to malignant phenotypes via a series of critical steps that involve morpho-logical changes referred to as the epithelial�mesenchymal transition EMT .4 EMT is a process originally observed during the embryonic development , in which cells lose epithelial characteristics.5�10 With respect to the chemotherapy , recent studies have demonstrated a close link between EMT and insensitivity to chemotherapeutic agents . Hiscox et al.11 showed increased b-catenin expression and elevated levels of transcription of b-catenin target genes known to be involved in tumor progression and EMT in the tamoxifen TAM -resistant MCF7 cells . Kajiyama et al.12 identified an association between chronic paclitaxel resistance and induction of EMT in epithelial ovarian carcinomas . In addition , we previously showed that transient adriamycin treatment-induced EMT and apoptosis simultaneously in a cell-cycle-dependent manner in breast cancer cells . Only the cells undergoing EMT showed enhanced invasion metastasis and multidrug resistance.13 Thus , EMT contributes to the malignant phenotypes of epithelial cancers in response to chemotherapy . Despite of these observations , how-ever , an understanding of the precise molecular mecha-nisms mediating chemotherapy-induced EMT is still developing . As EMT has a central role in cancer metastasis , it is not surprising that a staggering number of regulators are associated with this fundamental process . Recently , microRNAs miRNAs have appeared as powerful master regulators of EMT . miRNAs are small 20 to 22 nucleotide noncoding RNAs that inhibit gene expression at the post-transcriptional level.14 Each of the miRNAs , known to exist in mammalian cells , have multiple targets , making them powerful regulators of complex processes , such as differ-entiation and cancer progression.14�21 Emerging findings suggest that miRNAs contribute to the process of EMT . For example , miR-21 has pro-oncogenic effects as a result of its ability to inhibit several tumor and metastasis suppressors , 22 whereas miR-200 acts as an EMT suppressor via inhibition of ZEB1 and ZEB2.23�28 In this study , we report the discovery of miR-448 , the most downregulated miRNA in chemotherapy-treated breast cancer cells , as direct transcriptional target of nuclear factor kB NF-kB . miR-448 suppression directly promoted special AT-rich sequence-binding protein-1 SATB1 expression , which initiates amphiregulin AR �epidermal growth factor receptor EGFR signaling toward Twist1 expression and NF-kB activation via mitogen-activated protein kinase MAPK and PI3K Akt pathway , respectively , providing a distinct positive feedback mechanism leading to EMT . These findings reveal a regulatory feedback loop to retain miR-448 suppression upon chemotherapy and suggest that the loss of miR-448 may represent a novel mechanism leading to EMT in human breast cancer . miR-448 is significantly downregulated during the course of chemotherapy-induced EMT . After 36 h of culturing MCF7 cells with adriamycin 25 mg ml , analysis of array hybridization revealed 113 differentially expressed miRNAs Supplementary Table S1 . miR-448 was further investigated because it was the most significantly changed miRNA in the drug-treated cells Figure 1a , Supplementary Table S1 . miR-448 was confirmed by qRT-PCR to be markedly downregulated Figure 1b . We used miR-126 as a control miRNA and RUN6B as a normalization control , both of which were uniformly expressed in MCF7 cells treated with or without adriamycin . After MCF7 cells were cultured with different amounts of adriamycin for 36h , a clear dose-dependent effect of adriamycin on miR-448 suppression was observed , consistent with decreased expression of E-cadherin and upregulation of vimentin in a dose-responsive manner Figure 1c . This correlation suggests that miR-448 suppression might have a causal role in the chemotherapy-induced EMT . Apart from adriamycin , similar 7-and 14-fold suppression of miR-448 were also achieved by antitumor antibiotics daunomycin DM and plant alkaloids paclitaxel , respec-tively . This was in contrast to exposure to alkylating agents cyclophosphamide CP , anti-metabolism agents 5-FU and non-steroid antiestrogen TAM , which did not change miR-448 levels Figure 1d . We then investigated miR-448 levels in a series of human breast carcinoma cell lines . Endogenous miR-448 levels were significantly higher in epithelial breast cancer cells SKBR3 , SUM149 and SUM225 than in cells constitutively exhibiting mesenchymal phenotypes BT-549 and MDA-MB-231 . Moreover , miR-448 suppression on adriamycin treatment was only specific to epithelial cancer cells , whereas its levels remained unchanged in mesenchymal cancer cells treated with or without adriamycin Figure 1d . miR-448 negatively regulates drug-induced EMT . We next transfected the miR-448 inhibitors into MCF7 cells to determine the role of miR-448 in the drug-induced EMT . As shown in Figure 2A , the miR-448 inhibitor-induced EMT in MCF7 cells , characterized by acquisition of a fibroblast-like cell morphology , dissolution of tight junctions ZO-1 , formation of actin stress fibers F-actin , severe E-cadherin suppression and enhanced vimentin expression Figure 2B , similar to the effects observed in the drug-treated cells . Meanwhile , cell migration and Matrigel invasion rates were increased 5.5-and 6.5-fold , respectively , upon miR-448 downregulation Figure 2C , without any change in cell proliferation Supplementary Figure S1 . On the contrary , when we introduced the miR-448 precursor into MDA-MB-231 cells , which express miR-448 at a negli-gible level and typically have a mesenchymal phenotype , mesenchymal�epithelial transition was induced Figure 2A and B , accompanied with a more than threefold decrease in cell migration and invasiveness Figure 2C , without affecting the viability of these cells Supplementary Figure S2 . Similar effects were observed in vivo . The control MCF7 tumors were strictly non-invasive , as shown by their confine-ment within fibrotic capsules Figure 2D , a . In stark contrast , 7 out of 10 miR-448-silenced tumors showed a spindle-like morphology , with islands of cancer cells that had invaded the muscle Figure 2D , b . Immunohistochemical analyses further confirmed that the miR-448-silenced tumor cells were positive for both epithelial and mesenchymal markers Figure 2D , d and f , whereas the control tumors showed positive only for epithelial markers Figure 2D , c and e . At 6 weeks after implantation , the lungs of mice implanted with miR-448-silenced cells exhibited small clusters of hetero-morphic cells that were positive for either CK19 or vimentin Figure 2D , h , j , l . In the lungs of hosts bearing control MCF7 tumors , however , no metastatic foci were found and the only CK19-positive cells were normal bronchial epithelial cells Figure 2D , g , i , k . Non-aggressive tumors arose in 3 of 10 miR-448-inhibitor-treated MCF7 tumors , which was a result of plasmid loss rather than biological resistance to miR-448-mediated EMT , as determined by quantifying miR-448 expression by qRT-PCR Supplementary Figure S3 . NF-jB directly transsuppresses miR-448 in parallel with its host gene , HRT2C . We then investigated the potential transcription factors involved in the upstream regulation of miR-448 . miR-448 has been mapped to the fourth intron of HRT2C on chromosome X Supplementary Figure S4A . An algorithmic prediction of potential transfactor binding sites was performed using MatInspector software Genomatix Software GmbH , Munich , Germany . Putative-binding sites for NF-kB , AP1 , c-Myc and AP4 were identified Supplementary Figure S4B . The miR-448 promoter activity was evaluated after cotransfection of these candidate transfactors . Expression of NF-kB was associated with a significant decrease in miR-448 promoter activity , whereas AP1 , c-Myc and AP1 had no effect on promoter activity Supplementary Figure S4C , suggesting that miR-448 may be a downstream factor of NF-kB . Previous studies involving the genome-scale analysis of transcription factor binding predicts that a significant fraction of miRNAs appear to be located within the introns of protein-encoding genes , linking their expression to the promoter-driven regulation of their host genes . In agreement with this prediction , qRT-PCR assays showed that HRT2C expression was also downregulated by NF-kB activation on adriamycin treatment , to a similar extent as miR-448 . We next evaluated NF-kB binding activity in adriamycin-treated cells by EMSA . NF-kB activity was induced at 6 h after treatment , earlier than HRT2C miR-448 suppression Figure 3a . Similar effects were also observed in MCF7 and SUM149 cells treated with PMA , a specific activator of NF-kB Figure 3b . To further confirm the binding of NF-kB to the promoter of HRT2C miR-448 , we performed chromatin immunoprecipi-tation ChIP -qPCR experiments in adriamycin , DM or PMA-treated MCF7 cells using the NF-kB antibody . To this end , we used a series of PCR primers covering genomic regions surrounding the transcription start site TSS , and the results detected a strong PCR amplification in the core promoter region corresponding to the predicted NF-kB-binding site , but not in the surrounding region up downstream of miR-448 . Similar effects were also observed in SUM149 cells on adriamycin , DM or PMA treatment Figure 3c . Furthermore , to validate the regulation of NF-kB on miR-448 expression , cultured MCF7 or SUM149 cells were pretreated by NF-kB p65 siRNA , and then stimulated by adriamycin for another 72 h . Adiramycin-induced downregulation of miR-448 was significantly suppressed by NF-kB p65 siRNA in both MCF7 and SUM149 cells . Figure 3d . Thus , these results support the notion that HRT2C and hosted miR-448 share a common negative regulatory element located within the fourth intron of HRT2C gene , and that the transcriptional unit is transcrip-tionally suppressed by NF-kB . miR-448 suppression directly targets and promotes SATB1 expression . Among the approximately 100 targets predicted by the TargetScan32 and PicTar33 search programs , SATB1 was of particular interest , given that it is an important piece of the cascade that initiates EMT and promotes tumor metastasis . SATB1 has two potential miR-448-binding sites within its 30-UTR , which are highly conserved in various analyzed species Figure 4a . Reporter plasmids were constructed , in which portions of the 30-UTR encompassing the predicted binding sites SATB1wt , with or without mutations that would disrupt miRNA interaction SATB1mut1 and SATB1mut2 , were cloned downstream of a luciferase open reading frame . When introduced into MCF7 cells , the SATB1wt and SATB1mut1 constructs were expressed at significantly lower levels than the SATB1mut2 and SATB1v constructs , consistent with the direct functional interaction of endogenously expressed miR-448 with binding site 2 . Cotransfection of reporter plasmids with a synthetic miR-448 inhibitor or miR-448 precursor further restored or abolished the luciferase activity produced by the wild-type and mut1 reporter constructs , but had no effect on mut2 reporter constructs Figure 4b . When MCF7 cells were cultured in adriamycin-containing medium for 72 h , adriamycin-induced SATB1 expression at both mRNA and protein levels , which were largely abrogated by ectopic miR-448 expression Figure 4c . Importantly , antisense inhibition of miR-448 resulted in a moderate but significant increase in the level of endogenous SATB1 in MCF7 cells Figure 4d , and this effect was abolished by cotransfection with pre-miR-448 and or a siRNA directed against SATB1 Figure 4d . In parallel , pre-miR-448 treatment in MDA-MB-231 cells , which express miR-448 negligibly , resulted in decreased expression of SATB1 Figure 4d . Both down-and upregulation of miR-448 appear to be physio-logically relevant , given that they affected the levels of SATB1 within the physiologically relevant range observed in the epithelial versus the mesenchymal phenotype . miR-448-mediated SATB1 expression correlates with activation of AR�EGFR pathway . To identify the direct targeted genes of SATB1 in response to adriamycin treat-ment , we performed ChIP-seq of the DNAs from anti-SATB1 chromatin IP . A histogram of SATB1-binding sites residing within the downstream 2 kb or upstream 3 kb genomic regions relative to annotated TSSs is shown in Supple-mentary Figure S5A . Most of the SATB1-binding regions were identified around the TSS sites . The consensus sequence derived from the most frequent motifs found in the SATB1-bound promoters corresponds to a perfect SATB1 response element TATTAGTAATAA Supple-mentary Figure S5B . Using an false discovery rate cutoff of 0.05 , we identified a total of 538 SATB1-binding regions in the adriamycin-treated MCF7 cells Supplementary Table S2 . These results were further intensely analyzed by Gene Ontology . According to the biology function classification , 38 of 538 genes were associated with transcription , 37 were related to transport and 23 were involved in signal trans-duction Supplementary Figure S5C . The mostly strong SATB1-binding region by the number of sequence tags mapped is the gene for AR Supplementary Figure S5D , Supplementary Table S2 . With an antibody against SATB1 , substantial enrichment of the region spanning the AR was observed in the adriamycin-treated MCF7 and SUM149 cells , similar to what was observed after 72 h of treatment with DM or paclitaxel . In a luciferase reporter assay , the pGL3-AR promoter is induced by the expression of SATB1 by approximately eightfold . Treatment with adriamycin further enhanced secretion of AR in a dose-dependent manner , which was blocked by SATB1 siRNA Figure 5a . These results recapitulate the native expression pattern of the gene in MCF7 cells and verify a SATB1-dependent activation mechanism . AR has been shown to possess EGF-like activity . Treatment with miR-448 inhibitors led to both upregulation and phosphorylation of EGFR in MCF7 cells , following by subsequent activation of MAPK and Akt , but not STAT3 in downstream of the signaling pathway . These effects were largely abrogated by cotransfection with a siRNA directed against SATB1 or AR , suggesting the involvement of SATB1�AR�EGFR axis in this process Figure 5b . On one hand , inhibition of MAPK disrupted the adriamycin-induced Twist expression , a master regulator of EMT Figure 5c . On the other hand , a specific Akt inhibitor LY294002 signi-ficantly suppressed adriamycin-induced IkBa degradation and NF-kB activity . Thus , our data indicate that NF-kB-meidated miR-448 suppression promotes the expression of SATB1 , which enhances NF-kB activity and increases Twist1 expression by initiating AR�EGFR pathway , thereby providing a positive feedback loop mechanism to restrain miR-448 suppression and lead to EMT Figure 5d . miR-448 suppression correlates with SATB1 expression and the acquisition of mesenchymal phenotypes in post-chemotherapy human breast carcinoma . To establish the clinical relevance of miR-448 regulation in chemotherapy-induced effects , we assessed miR-448 expression and tumor phenotypes in 18 patients with breast carcinoma who had paired tumor specimens available from before and after chemotherapy . Representative sections showing SATB1 , Twist1 , CK19 and vimentin staining are shown in Figure 6 , and results for individual patients are listed in Table 1 and Supplementary Table S3 . Although the morphology of breast carcinomas after chemotherapy did not differ markedly from native tumors , the six patients who received the CP , epirubicin plus taxotere CET or CP , epirubicin plus 5-fluorouracil 5-FU regimen showed a reduction in miR-448 expression P ? 0.02 , paired t-test , whereas the patients who received the CP , metho-trexate plus 5-FU CMF regimen showed the stable levels of miR-448 Table 1 . Moreover , control miR-126 showed no difference in the expression level in all cases data not shown . Immunohistochemical staining revealed focally positivity of the tumor cells for both SATB1 and Twist1 in 12 patients who received the CET CEF regimen . These phenomena correlated with partial loss of the epithelial marker CK19 and acquisition of vimentin expression Figure 6 and Supplementary Table S3 , illustrating that the phenotypic changes paralleled miR-448 suppression . Similar results were not detected , however , in the patients who received the CMF regimen Supplementaryand Supple-mentary Table S3 . Discussion Many patients with cancers experience a relapse after treatment with the currently available adjuvant chemothera-pies , primarily because of the residue tumor cells . Although some cells in a tumor are killed by chemotherapy agents apoptosis , the surviving cells undergo EMT which promotes not only cell survival but also cell metastasis and resistance to chemotherapy.13 This highlights the strong need for rational , mechanism-based therapies . One approach with great potential to achieve this goal is the identification and targeting of key substances involved in EMT . Our findings are of importance to the understanding of chemotherapy-induced EMT in breast tumors , as they directly link miR-448 to this process . Chemotherapy-induced miR-448 suppression enables the MCF7 cells to acquire mesenchymal characteristics associated with invasive and metastatic behavior in vitro and in vivo . Further , silencing of miR-448 exerts the pro-EMT effects by directly targeting and promoting SATB1 expression . SATB1 , a genome organizer , is an important step in the cascade that initiates EMT and metastasis in breast tumors . It reprogrammes chromatin organization and the transcription profiles of breast tumors to act as a determinant of morphogenesis and metastasis.29 Herein , an inverse correlation was found between miR-448 and SATB1 in drug-treated breast cancer cell lines , in post-chemotherapy human breast samples , and in tumor-implanted mice . We proposed that miR-448 suppression is pivotal in the process of chemotherapy-induced EMT . Several studies comparing the miRNA expression profiles between epithelial and mesenchymal tumor cells have established the functional role of miRNAs in EMT . It is likely that other endogenous miRNAs , such as miR-200,23�27 miR-20524,30 and miR-21,22,31 also have related pro-or anti-EMT functions and that miR-448 may belong to a family of miRNAs involved in EMT . We have detected several members of the miR-200 family , as well as miR-21 and miR-10b , in MCF7 cells . Under the conditions of used in our study , these miRNAs appeared to be down-or upregulated in MCF7 cells exposed to adria-mycin . Thus , although various miRNAs have been implicated in chemotherapy-induced EMT in epithelial breast cancers , miR-448 has a dominant and functional role in this process . It is interesting to note that miR-448 has a significant regulatory effect on SATB1 expression in epithelial mesen-chymal breast cancer cells , although additional factors including other miRNAs can not be absolutely excluded . It has been proved that knockdown of SATB1 in highly aggres-sive cancer cells results in altered expression of more than 1000 genes , many of which are known to be involved in oncogenic pathways.29 In this study , we have undertaken a global screening approach to identify the promoters that are bound by SATB1 under chemotherapy . AR , the EGFR ligand , showed a distinct SATB1-dependent expression in adria-mycin-treated MCF7 cells . Initially , the goal of the ChIP-seq screen was to determine the promoter specificity of SATB1 during adriamycin treatment , but our subsequent analysis revealed that SATB1 bound the same targets regardless of the drugs used , suggesting the common mechanism of transcriptional regulation by SATB1 . AR has been shown previously to induce differential effects through the EGFR signaling , contributing to the progression of several cancers.32�35 The literature showing a connection between AR and EMT is not extensive . A link between EGFR and EMT was found previously however , these studies have implied that EMT may contribute to resistance to EGFR-directed therapy.36�38 As demonstrated in this study , an inhibitor of EGFR MAPK signaling reduced Twist1 expression , a master regulator of EMT , in the adriamycin-treated cells never-theless , it exerted no effects on adriamycin-induced NF-kB activation , which was later shown to be because of the PI3K Akt pathway . Hence , our studies are the first to identify Twist1 , as well as NF-kB , downstream of the EGFR on adria-mycin treatment , suggesting a possible connection between of them in the context of SATB1-mediated AR expression . Furthermore , NF-kB is indeed recruited to the miR-448 HRT2C promoter region to suppress miR-448 expression in adriamycin-treated MCF7 cells , demonstrating the existence Table 1 Summary of results Patient of a functional NF-kB-regulated suppressor upstream of the miR-448 HRT2C gene . Activation of NF-kB has been observed after chemotherapy , which is linked to E-cadherin downregulation and Snail family induction , thereby initiates an anti-apoptotic response and promotes mesenchymal transi-tion in various tumors.39 However , recent data suggest this regulatory route does not sufficiently explain the full pro-EMT and anti-apoptotic potential of NF-kB . This study helps refine our understanding of NF-kB-induced EMT , that is , miR-488 suppression by NF-kB represents a rather slow-acting yet long-lasting stimulus , which further enhances NF-kB activity and appears as an ideal complementation of the immediate induction of EMT . Thus , although the mechanism underlying NF-kB activation initiated by adriamycin still remains unclear , the study herein provide a positive feedback loop mechanism to restrain miR-448 suppression , lead to EMT and resistant to drug-induced apoptosis . Integrating the use of drugs targeted to miR-448 or other key substances into specific chemo-therapy regimens anthracyclines , antitumor antibiotics or alkaloid based might be an effective means to improve the efficacy of systemic treatment in patients with breast cancer .

20801114	The case for autoimmunity in glaucoma Martin B. Wax Department of Ophthalmology Visual Sciences , University of Texas Southwestern Medical a r t i c l e i n f o Article history Keywords Mrs. Smith is a 55-year-old woman who has seen several times in consultation for glaucoma by a tertiary glaucoma specialist . After extensive work-up , she was diagnosed with normal pressure glaucoma because she demonstrated significant optic nerve damage by ophthalmoscopy and visual field loss by perimetry that demonstrated the characteristic anterior nerve fiber bundle loss that is common in glaucoma . Her findings are similar to that found in patients who frequently have elevated IOP . However , multi-year follow up and diurnal IOP recordings have never detected elevated IOP . Furthermore , all her ancillary laboratory studies were unre-markable except for two findings . The first was the presence of a monoclonal gammopathy that indicates the presence of a systemic clonal expansion of B cells that may or may not have anything to do with her glaucoma . The second is an elevated titer of selected anti-retinal ONH antibodies as assessed by the investi-gator in his academic laboratory . There are many patients that are similar to Mrs. Smith who have similar ophthalmic findings but whose laboratory values may suggest a systemic immune abnormality that at first glance , does not seem directly relevant to their glaucoma . For example , they may have elevated antiphosphatidyl serine antibodies as a lone abnormal laboratory test Kremmer et al. , 2001 , or elevated anti-bodies to the Sjogren antigens Ro or La , even though they have no frank evidence of Sjogren�s syndrome or any other autoimmune disease Wax et al. , 1998b . As the result of over a decade in which Center , 5323 Harry Hines Boulevard , Dallas , TX , USA multiple reports have served to increase our awareness as to the potential roles of the immune system in contributing to glaucom-atous neuropathy in selected patients , Mrs. Smith and other similar patients might be given a diagnostic label of �presumed auto-mimmune glaucoma� . However there is little agreement on what such an entity entails or even if the descriptor is an accurate or meaningful one . Yet the role of the immune system is now commonly acknowledged to be a potential etiology of neuropathy in some patients with glaucoma Weinreb and Khaw , 2004 Wax and Tezel , 2009 . Equally relevant are the advances and under-standing made in both experimental animal models of glaucoma as well as in human glaucoma autopsy findings in the 90�s and 00�s that suggests there is a fundamental role of the immune system in mediating neuronal cell death in glaucoma regardless of intraocular pressure levels even if the pathogenesis of the neuropathy is not autoimmune in nature . Schwartz , 2003 Wax and Tezel , 2004 , , 2009 . There are a growing number of observations that strongly support a potential pathogenic role for autoimmunity in facilitating neuronal loss in glaucomatous optic neuropathy Grus et al. , 2008 . Here , we shall review the evidence that autoimmunity is deserving of consideration as to the mechanism by which glaucomatous optic neuropathy is either initiated or exacerbated in what is likely a small number of patients with glaucoma . 1 . Immunoregulation governs RGC death in glaucoma Understanding the reciprocal relationship between the nervous and immune systems has become an important area of glaucoma research . One key premise is that immunoregulation is the arbiter that ultimately determines whether RGCs live or die in patients with glaucoma . Furthermore , the immunoregulatory mechanisms that determine RGC fate are influenced not only by the well-recognized risk factor of increased IOP , but by other stress condi-tions such as those occur with aging , oxidative stress , altered vascular perfusion and structural composition of the neuronal tissue , autoimmunity , and other factors that have yet to be identi-fied which may very well impart their own stamp on the fate of RGCs and their axons . The role of non-IOP dependent stressors including cytotoxic autoantibodies and oxidative stress due to increased production of reactive oxygen species ROS are also critical factors for the initiation and dysregulation of a stress-induced immune response which can also facilitate the progression of glaucomatous neurodegeneration . This subject is reviewed in detail elsewhere . Wax and Tezel , 2009 Tezel , 2006 It should be noted that the life or death decision for an RGC is not necessarily a response to a single stressor alone that may tip the balance of cell fate , but rather may involve two or more cell stressors that may have additive or even synergistic effects . Finally , genetic factors may predispose a given patient to be more or less susceptible to individual stressors themselves . HSPs are among the most highly conserved and abundant proteins in nature and play an important role in cell survival under many environmental stresses as well as under normal conditions . Increased expression of HSPs , particularly including HSP70 and HSP27 , is notable in the brain , since both proteins are highly inducible in glial cells and neurons following a wide range of noxious stimuli Franklin et al. , 2005 . Besides intrinsic protective mechanisms , these proteins have also been associated with auto-immune diseases . In glaucomatous eyes , widespread and chronic tissue stress is evident in the retina and optic nerve head by a prominent up-regulation of HSPs Tezel et al. , 2000 . Central to the hypothesis that HSPs have an essential role in either the initiation or sustainment of immunogenic injury is their key property as being highly antigenic . HSPs are the major antigenic proteins for many infectious agents including bacteria , mycobacteria and parasites . The resulting strong immune responses to the HSPs of theseorganismshavethepotentialtocross-reactwitheitherhostHSPs or to normal tissue components of the host . HSPs have the ability to elicit immune responses in such a way that the immune system may use changes in the expression of self HSPs as a signal to detect and eliminate their own cells that are infected , transformed , or otherwise stressed by heat shock , nutrient deprivation , oxygen radicals and or metabolic disruption Young and Elliott , 1989 Young , 1992 . Their high degree of sequence conservation between prokary-otic and eukaryotic chaperonins makes them candidate antigens for models of autoimmunity based on molecular mimicry . A premise of molecular mimicry is that immune responses to infectious agents may generalize to native cellular proteins that share similar protein sequences , resulting in serum antibodies that recognize these proteins . The hypothesis whereby infectious agents initiate aber-rant immune tissue-specific responses due to molecular mimicry between the infectious agent and native tissue proteins is well recognized and has been implicated in the development of numerous organ specific autoimmune diseases . In several auto-immune diseases , the autoantigen has been successfully identified and shares similarity to its immunological equivalent , namely the offending pathogen protein , which may , in fact , be an HSP . The potential role of HSPs in glaucoma has been previously extensively reviewed Wax and Tezel , 2009 . Most recently however , upregulated toll-like receptors have been found in human glau-coma donor eyes that might be due to exposure to HSPs in these eyes . This is supported by parallel in vitro studies using rat retinal microglia and astrocytes . Tezel et al. , 2010 . 3 . Aberrant immunity in glaucoma patients In patients with glaucoma , an autoimmune mechanism that elicits glaucomatous neurodegeneration has been hypothesized since autoimmune damage to neuronal tissue may result from and autoimmune response to a sensitizing antigen which in turn results in neuronal injury Wax et al. , 1998b Romano et al. , 1999 . The observation of increased Helicobacter pylori titers among glaucoma patients may support the possibility that molecular mimicry may also underlie the neurodegenerative injury in glaucoma Kountouras et al. , 2001 . In addition , epitope mapping has revealed that the immunogenicity of rhodopsin antibodies detected in glaucoma patient sera is shared by epitopes of proteins found in common bacterial and viral pathogens Romano et al. , 1999 . Evidence that supports the findings that glaucoma could be an autoimmune neuropathy in some patients includes numerous humoral , cellular , and experimental studies in patients with glau-coma as well as in animal models . This evidence includes the long-recognized epidemiologic association of immune-related diseases in 30 % of patients with normal pressure glaucoma , Cartwright et al. , 1992 the presence of aberrant serum autoantibodies including monoclonal paraproteins , and non-organ specific anti-bodies to DNA , RNA , and nuclear proteins , in many glaucoma patients Wax et al. , 1994 elevated levels of autoantibodies to heat shock proteins HSPs in the glaucoma patient sera Tezel et al. , 1998 Wax et al. , 1998a , , 1998b and immunoglobulin deposition in the RGC layer as observed in the postmortem examination of eyes from a patient with normal pressure glaucoma and para-proteinemia Wax et al. , 1998a . An increasing number of serum autoantibodies to other retina or optic nerve proteins in glaucoma patients have also been identified by different laboratories over the past decade including elevated serum autoantibody titers to optic nerve head glycosaminoglycans Tezel et al. , 1999 retinal antigens , including rhodopsin Romano et al. , 1995 , heat shock proteins Wax et al. , 1998b Tezel et al. , 1998 , gamma-enolase Maruyama et al. , 2000 , glutathione S-transferase Yang et al. , 2001 alpha-fodrin Grus et al. , 2006 , neurofilament protein Yano et al. , 2005 as well as generalized antibodies to phosphatidylserine Kremmer et al. , 2001 . The majority of these studies demonstrate that most of these elevated antibody titers occur in patients with normal pres-sure glaucoma , although many patients with elevated IOP appear to have elevated or in some cases , decreased antibody titers as well Joachim et al. , 2005 . In some cases , experimental findings have supported the pathogenic potential of these autoantibodies by binding native proteins and inhibiting their functions Tezel and Wax , 2000 . In addition to the evidence supporting the cellular and humoral components of adaptive immunity , an innate immune response is also evident in glaucoma . For example , findings of proteomic and immunohistochemical analyses are consistent with an early up-regulation of several complement components in experimental glaucoma models as well as in human glaucoma Tezel et al. , 2010 . In addition , findings of a recent study have provided evidence that the complement cascade may directly contribute to the neurode-generative injury in glaucoma Stevens et al. , 2007 . The role of complement in glaucomatous neuropathy has been linked to the putative role of complement proteins in synapse elimination . One feature of many neuropathies is die-back inhibition , or an atrophy of primary neural pathways due to �disconnection� or atrophy at the next order synaptic neuron Spencer and Schaumburg , 1977 Pigino et al. , 2009 . As a result , there are presently on-going efforts in several laboratories to determine if the use of complement inhibitors can effectively minimize , retard or prevent synaptic degeneration in glaucomatous neuropathy . 4 . Aberrant immunity and its role in optic nerve cupping We have previously reported on three possible mechanisms whereby aberrant immunity or autoimmunity may help facilitate non-pressure dependent cupping of the optic nerve in patients with glaucoma . The first relates to the role of the inflammatory cytokine TNF-a and its intimaterelationship with matrix metalloproteinases , both of which appear to be upregulated in the optic nerve heads of patients with glaucoma , particularly normal pressureglaucoma . Not only does TNF-a regulate MMP synthesis and activation , but the release of TNF-a form its membrane bound precursor is an MMP-dependent process . We proposed that cupping in the absence of elevated pressure might be the results of MMP activation that is TNF-driven in some patients with glaucoma . Yan et al. , 2000 . Second , we observed that the astrocytes in glaucomatous human donor eyes have increased expression of the HLA-DR antigen on their surface . Similarly , immunogenicity of laminar cribrosa astrocytes derived from normal donor eyes increased in culture conditions in response to ischemia and selected cytokines as evidenced by the increased expression of the HLA-DR antigen on their surface Yang et al. , 2001 . The increase in HLA-DR expression is often a signal for elimination by the immune system . One can therefore appreciate that the consequences of astrocyte elimination in the ONH might be cupping . Third , we explored the role that autoantibodies to optic nerve head glycosaminoglycans may have on optic nerve cupping Tezel et al. , 1999 . Glycosaminoglycans GAGs not only appear to play a major role in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases , and it seems quite feasible that the antibodies that bind to glycosami-noglycans may change the organization and physical characteristics of the optic nerve head tissue by some modifications in the shape , size , length , level of sulfation , anionic sites or water content of glycosaminoglycans , thereby increasing the susceptibility of optic nerve head to damage . This is precedented in other diseases such as Lupus , in which GAG antibodies are thought to impair renal function . Furthermore , we postulated that by changing the microenvironment surrounding injured axons , alterations in glycosaminoglycan composition in the lamina cribrosa of some patients may account for the increased vulnerability of remaining axons to sustain further damage regardless of intraocular pressure . 5 . Partial fulfillment of Koch�s postulates e the gold standard for autoimmunity Despite the strength of the humoral and cellular immunological associations above , a key limitation to the clinical interpretation of these findings pertains to our inability to assess whether any of the autoantibodies found in glaucoma patients are of pathogenic impor-tance , or whether the autoantibody findings are merely epiphenom-enon or a non-specific biomarker that accompanies the disease process . Studies that conclusively demonstrate whether glaucomatous disease can be elicited by administration of the putative pathogenic antibodies in an animal model would go a long way towards resolving this issue . Inaneffort to developa modelof experimentalautoimmune glaucoma , we sought to determine whether antigen immunization causes glaucoma-like RGC specific cytotoxicity by fulfilling a key Koch postulate that is , by trying to elicit the disease with administration of the presumed causative agent . Since many glaucoma patients exhibit increased titers of serum antibodies against HSPs , and these stress proteins are known to be highly antigenic we selected HSPs for antigen injections . In the first direct support of this hypothesis Wax et al. , 2008 , we found that HSP27 and HSP60 immunization in the Lewis rat induced RGC degeneration and axon loss 1e4 months later in vivo in a pattern with similarities to human glaucoma , including topographic spec-ificity of cell loss . Infiltration of increased numbers of T-cells in the retina occurred much earlier , 14e21 days after HSP immunization , and appeared to be transient . In vitro studies found that T-cells activated by HSP immunization induced RGC apoptosis via the release of the inflammatory cytokine FasL , whereas HSP immuni-zation induced activation of microglia cells and up-regulation of the FasL receptor in RGCs . These results suggest that RGC degeneration in glaucoma for selected individuals may involve failed immuno-regulation of the T-cell-RGC axis and is thus a disturbance of both pro-apoptotic and protective pathways . The direct evidence described above that immunization to HSPs can result in glaucomatous loss in a susceptible animal may be the closest we will ever get to �proving� that glaucoma , in at least some patients , may be autoimmune in nature . As such , the fulfillment of a key Koch�s postulate in the case of glaucoma is considerably greater evidence for autoimmune causality than is found for the vast majority of presumed autoimmune diseases , particularly for central and peripheral the neuropathies , in which the weight of the evidence lies mainly in antibody associations . However , what is compelling is that there have been formidable arguments made that in addition to traditionally acknowledged autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis , evidence is rapidly accu-mulating that other disease in which autoimmunity was considered unlikely , probably deserve reconsideration . Table 1 summarizes the key findings that support the role of autoimmunity in classic disease such as rheumatoid arthritis , and compares these findings to those found in a disease in which autoimmunity has now been elevated to a very credible and tenable hypothesis , namely in some patients with atherosclerosis . Schett et al. , 1995 Foteinos and Xu , 2009 . 7 . Autoimmune glaucoma and clinical diagnosis One of the present difficulties in diagnosing patients in whom autoimmunity might have a causative or sustainable role in their glaucomatous disease , is the fact that there is often not a single test that can be used to confirm the diagnosis of �presumed autoim-mune glaucoma� . Typically , the physician must rule out other causes of glaucoma many of which are obvious such as high IOP . In normal pressure glaucoma , possible causes such as impaired blood flow ischemia , vasospasm migraine systemic nocturnal hypo-tension and sleep apnea are often more common considerations In essence , presumed autoimmune glaucoma is a diagnosis of exclu-sion . An affected patient may certainly have more than one autoimmune disease and this may be an important clue Cartwright et al , 1992 . However , like many other autoimmune diseases , presumed autoimmune glaucoma may be organ specific . In fact , one common feature to most autoimmune diseases , is that the ultimate response is tissue specific . This tissue specificity derives from the nature of the autoantigen recognized . Flavell and Hafler , 1999 . Thus awareness of the potential of organ specific autoimmunity that might underlie glaucoma in specific patient is often the main prerequisite for recognition of the disease . In conclusion , the case for autoimmunity as a potential cause of glaucoma continues to gain compelling ground based on associa-tive data to antibody and cellular immune system findings in Table 1 Glaucoma-evidence for autoimmunity Macrophage activation Glaucoma TNF-alpha MMP expression Interleukin 6 Mast cell activation O T cell activation soluble IL2 receptor HLA-DR CD4 ?

Peroxiredoxin Prx is an antioxidant peroxidase enzyme responsible for elimination of hydrogen peroxide , peroxynitrite , and organic hydroperoxides.15 Prxs function in cellular protec-tion against oxidative stress , regulation of cell proliferation , and modulation of intracellular signaling pathways that use hydrogen peroxide as a secondary signal transmitter . The six mammalian isoforms of Prx are produced at a high level and are differentially localized in the cytoplasm , mitochondria , nucleus , and peroxisomes . They are divided into two main subgroups , 1-Cys and 2-Cys Prx , based on the number of conserved catalytic cysteine peroxidatic cysteine . Prx6 is the only member of 1-Cys Prx and has non-selenium glutathione peroxidase and phospholipase A2 activities.16 Upregulation of Prx6 suppresses intracellular enzyme inactivation , membrane phospholipid peroxidation , and cell death mediated by oxidative stress.17,18 In addition , Prx6-deficient mice are susceptible to oxidative stress by hypoxia or paraquat treatment , leading to increase of mortality and lung injury.19,20 Identification of new proteins capable of modulating the activity of DED-harboring caspase is required for a better understanding of diverse cell death pathways and DED-associated human diseases including tumor . Thus , to isolate DED-binding partners , we performed a yeast two-hybrid assay and identified Prx6 as a negative regulator of DED caspases . Results Prx6 binds to caspase-10 and caspase-8 through the DED . Prx6 was identified as a caspase-10-binding protein by a yeast two-hybrid screening assay using the DED DED amino acids , 1�219 of caspase-10 as bait . To confirm that Prx6 indeed interacts with caspase-10 , we performed an in vitro binding assay using the purified GST-fused DED of caspase-10 protein Figure 1a . Incubation of GST-fused DED with Prx showed that Prx6 binds to caspase-10 , while Prx1 fails to do so . FADD was used as a positive control as it is well known to recruit caspase-10 though DED�DED interaction . We explored the binding regions of caspase-10 using HA-fused full-length caspase-10 amino acids , 1�521 and its serial deletion mutants , including caspase-10DED 1�219 , caspase-10DDED 220�521 , and caspase-10p20 220�415 Figure 1b . From immunoprecipitation assays , we found that caspase-10 and caspase-10DED , but not caspase-10DDED and caspase-10p20 , could interact with Prx6 , indicating that DED is responsible for the interaction . The binding specificity of Prx6 to DED was then addressed . Like caspase-10 , caspase-8 also has DED for the homotypic association with adaptor proteins , whereas caspase-9 has a caspase recruitment domain CARD . In vitro binding assays showed that GST-fused Prx6 binds to caspase-8 but not to caspase-9 , while GST-fused CARD of Apaf-1 binds to caspase-9 Figure 1c . Prx6 failed to bind to other DED-containing proteins , such as FADD and cFLIPL , besides DED caspases . Cellular interactions of endogenous Prx6 with DED caspases were also observed as assessed with immunoprecipitation assays Figure 1d and e . The specificity of the anti-Prx6 antibody we generated was validated by western blotting , showing no cross-reactivity with other members of the Prx family Figure 2e . These results indicate that Prx6 binds to caspase-10 and caspase-8 through DED in vitro and in cells . Further , we investigated the interaction of Prx6 with caspase-10 or caspase-8 in living cells using bimolecular fluorescence complementation BiFC assay , which enables us to visualize the formation of protein complexes and the location of protein interaction in living cells by fluorescence resonance energy transfer.21 Prx6 was fused to the N-terminal fragment of Venus VN pPrx6-VN and caspase-10 , caspase-9 , and caspase-8 were fused to the C-terminal fragment of Venus VC pCaspase-10-VC , pCas-pase-9-VC , and pCaspase-8-VC , respectively . Co-expres-sion of pCapase-10-VC or pCaspase-8-VC with pPrx6-VN exhibited fluorescence complementation , which was ob-served as small green dots predominantly in the cytosol , while co-expression of pCaspase-9-VC with pPrx6-VN showed no green fluorescence Figure 1f , GFP channel . The fluorescence complementation between the bZIP domains of Jun and Fos bJun and bFos fused to VN and VC bJun-VN and bFos-VC , respectively was used as a positive control and observed in nucleoli.21 No fluorescence was detected in the reactions containing pPrx6-VN , pCaspase-10-VC , pCaspase-9-VC , or pCaspase-8-VC alone and expression of all of the fusion proteins was verified by western blotting data not shown . Prx6 suppresses cell death mediated by caspase-10 and caspase-8 . To gain insight into why Prx6 interacts with caspase-10 and caspase-8 , we tested whether Prx6 regulates the cell death induced by these caspases . Ectopic expression of Prx6 suppressed cell death induced by caspase-10 or caspase-8 , not by caspase-12 or caspase-9 , while cell death induced by each of those caspases was blocked by a pan-caspase inhibitor , zVAD-fmk Figure 2a . Dose-dependent protective activity of Prx6 was clearly observed in cells expressing caspase-10 or caspase-8 and thus undergoing apoptosis Figure 2b and c . Among six mammalian isoforms of Prx , we then assessed the selective effect of Prx6 on cell death triggered by caspase-10 or caspase-8 . In spite of the protective activities of Prx members harboring peroxidase activity , which reduces the intracellular level of ROS , other Prx members Prx1�5 except Prx6 were not effective in suppressing cell death induced by caspase-10 or caspase-8 Figure 2d and did not bind to the DED of caspase-10 or caspase-8 in vitro Supplementary Figure 1 . The relative expression levels of GFP-fused Prx proteins were confirmed by western blotting Figure 2e . In addition , Prx6 was most effective in suppres-sing TRAIL-induced cell death among Prx members Supple-mentary Figure 2a . Further , C47S and C91S Prx6 mutants , which contain replaced serine in the peroxidatic cysteine C47 and the other conserved cysteine C91 , respectively , retained much of their ability to suppress DED caspase-induced cell death , although peroxidase activity-dead C47S Prx6 mutant17 was less effective than wild-type or C91S Prx6 mutant Figure 2f and g . The C47S and C91S Prx6 mutants also suppressed TRAIL-induced apoptosis Supplementary Figure 2b . These observations suggest that the antiapoptotic activity of Prx6 in TRAIL signaling may not require its peroxidase activity . Prx6 inhibits TRAIL-induced cell death of cancer cells . We established a mixed cell population HeLa HA-Prx6 Mix or single-cell clones HeLa HA-Prx6 # 7 and # 12 that conditionally and stably express HA-tagged Prx6 in HeLa cells . Expression of HA-Prx6 in HeLa HA-Prx6 # 7 and # 12 stable cells was induced upon the removal of doxycycline to a similar level with endogenous Prx6 Figure 3a and b . HA-Prx6 was not detected in cells grown in the presence of doxycycline Figure 3a . As shown in Figure 3c and d , the increased expression of Prx6 significantly suppressed apoptosis induced by TNF family member , TRAIL 55 % to B18 % at 6 h in HeLa HA-Prx6 # 7 and # 12 cells or TNF-a 30 % to B15 % at 6 h in HeLa HA-Prx6 # 7 and # 12 cells . However , Prx6 had no effect on apop-tosis induced by A23187 , etoposide , or staurosporine Figure 3e�g . Consistent with these results , Prx6 inhibited cell death triggered by the expression of TNF receptor1 TNFR1 or TRAIL receptors , DR4 and DR5 , by about 30 % , but not that triggered by truncated Bid tBid Figure 3h . Protein and mRNA levels of receptor signaling proteins in apoptosis were not affected by the induction of Prx6 expression Figure 3a and b . Conversely , when we reduced the expression of Prx6 using Prx6 short hairpin RNAs Prx6 shRNA # 1 or # 2 , we found that HeLa cells became significantly sensitive to cell death mediated by caspase-10 or caspase-8 , but not to that mediated by caspase-12 or caspase-9 Figure 4a and b . Further , Prx6 shRNAs also sensitized HeLa cells to cell death induced by TRAIL 25 % Figure 4c or TNFa 21 % Figure 4d , but did not affect cell death by A23187 Figure 4e or staurosporine data not shown . Knockdown of Prx6 itself did not trigger cell death in the absence of cell-death stimuli data not shown . These results suggest that Prx6 has an essential role in the receptor-mediated apoptosis , which is coordinated with caspase-10 and caspase-8 . Prx6 inhibits TRAIL-induced activation of caspase-10 and caspase-8 by interfering with death-inducing signaling complex DISC formation . We explored whether Prx6 directly modulates enzymatic activation of caspase-10 and caspase-8 to inhibit TRAIL-induced cell death . From western blotting , we found that compared with HeLa HA-Prx6 # 7 control cells , the proteolytic processing of caspase-10 and caspase-8 was apparently reduced by the expression of Prx6 in HeLa HA-Prx6 # 7 stable cells after removal of doxycycline Figure 5a . The processed forms of downstream caspase-3 and PARP were also less detected in HeLa HA-Prx6 # 7 stable cells expressing Prx6 than in control cells . Consistently , enzymatic activation of caspase-10 and caspase-8 as well as caspase-3 was significantly suppressed at early time points ranging from 0.5 to 1.5 h after treatment with TRAIL Figure 5b�e . These results suggest that Prx6 functions as an apoptosis suppressor that directly inhibits the activation of caspase-10 and caspase-8 in TRAIL-mediated apoptosis . The observation that Prx6 interacts with caspase-10 and caspase-8 and regulates TRAIL-induced cell death led us to examine the effects of Prx6 on the formation of DISC . Immunoprecipitation assay showed that after exposure to TRAIL , caspase-10 , caspase-8 , and FADD were detected in DR4-or DR5-containing DISC , which was isolated from HeLa HA-Prx6 # 7 cells cultured in the presence of doxycycline Figure 6a . However , caspase-10 and caspase-8 were not or were much less detected in the DISC isolated from TRAIL-treated HeLa HA-Prx6 # 7 cells expressing HA-Prx6 , while the recruitment of FADD to DISC was not affected . Furthermore , endogenous interaction of Prx6 with caspase-10 or caspase-8 , which was observed in HeLa HA-Prx6 # 7 stable cells grown in the presence of doxycycline , was inhibited upon treatment with TRAIL . More interestingly , these interactions still remained in HeLa HA-Prx6 # 7 cells after withdrawal of doxycycline Figure 6a . FADD was not detected in the immunoprecipitates containing Prx6 independently of TRAIL treatment . These results suggest that Prx6 may inhibit the formation of DISC in the cells exposed to TRAIL through its interaction with DED caspases . During DISC formation of apoptosis , FADD is known to interact with DED caspases through DED , whereas Prx6 is also believed to bind to DED caspases in live cells . Thus , we further assessed a possible mechanism for the regulation of protein�protein interaction between Prx6 , FADD , and DED caspases . From in vitro binding assays , we found that the interaction of Prx6 with caspase-10 or caspase-8 was gradually decreased by the presence of increasing amounts of FADD protein in the reaction Figure 6b . The disruption of Prx6�caspase-8 interaction by FADD seems to be more dramatic than that of Prx6�caspase-10 . These results imply that there is competitive binding of DED caspases to Prx6 and FADD and thus , the relative amounts of DED caspase-binding partners may be important to regulate the recruitment of DED caspase into DISC during TRAIL signaling . Upregulation of Prx6 expression in metastatic gastric cancer cells renders TRAIL resistance to cancer cells . Consistent with the previous studies in breast cancers , 22,23 we also found that the expression of Prx6 was significantly elevated in highly metastatic gastric cancer cells , including SNU-5 , SNU-16 , SNU-216 , SNU-601 , and SNU-668,24 as compared with primary cancer cells Figure 7a . These TRAIL-resistant cancer cells showed no significant change in the level of cFLIP , a known suppressor of TRAIL cytotoxicity in metastatic cancers25 Figure 7a . Further , we observed that those metastatic gastric cancer cells were relatively resistant to TRAIL-induced cell death Figure 7b , indicating that there may be a correlation between the level of Prx6 expression and TRAIL resistance in metastatic gastric cancer cells . Then , silencing of Prx6 expression in SNU-216 gastric cancer cells by using two independent Prx6 shRNAs increases cells� susceptibility to TRAIL-induced cell death Figure 7c . Thus , these results indicate that upregulation of Prx6 expression in metastatic gastric cancer cells decreases cells� susceptibility to TRAIL-induced cell death and thereby may contribute to tumor surveillance in TRAIL-resistant metastatic cancers . Discussion DED is a prototypical protein interaction domain that functions predominantly in the regulation and execution of programmed cell death and additionally in the control of cell proliferation . In most cases , DED-containing proteins form a protein complex through homotypic DED interactions . However , non-homotypic interaction of DED-containing protein has also been reported . DED-lacking DED-associated factor DEDAF and caspase-8 and caspase-10-associated RING protein CARP interact with caspase-10 and caspase-8 in the cytosol and regulate the function of DED caspases.26,27 Similarly , DED-lacking Prx6 interacts with DED-containing caspase-10 and caspase-8 but not with structurally similar CARD-contain-ing caspase-9 . Any structural motifs of Prx6 responsible for these interactions are not clarified yet . Despite the fact that Prx1�6 belong to the peroxiredoxin family harboring peroxidase activity , it is clear that only Prx6 can interact with DED caspases and concomitantly suppress cell death mediated by DED caspases . The amino-acid sequence identity of Prx6 , the only member of the 1-Cys subgroup , with other Prxs is low o20 % , whereas that among the 2-Cys subgroup members is high 60�80 % . The low level of homology of Prx6 with other Prxs might confer DED caspase-binding specificity to Prx6 . Several previous studies have demonstrated that Prx6 has unique binding partners such as surfactant protein A and saitohin.28,29 Interestingly , only Prx6 uses glutathione as a physiological reductant , while other Prxs use thioredoxin.16 Then , how does Prx6 regulate TRAIL-mediated cell death through DED caspases ? The antiapoptotic activity of Prx6 can be exerted mainly by two possible mechanisms . One is that Prx6 suppresses cell death triggered by TRAIL through its peroxidase activity . However , other Prxs Prx1�5 do not affect much TRAIL-induced cell death , and peroxidase activity-dead C47S Prx6 mutant , which does not show structural change , still has antiapoptotic activity , indicating that the peroxidase activity of Prx6 is not sufficient to regulate TRAIL or DED caspase-mediated cell death . The other , major mechanism is that Prx6 binds to and sequestrates DED caspases that are not to be recruited into the DISC complex even in the presence of TRAIL signaling . This is the reason why Prx6 effectively suppresses DED caspase and TRAIL-induced cell death and fails to inhibit cell death induced by the intrinsic cell death stimuli and caspase-9 . In addition , of six Prx members , only Prx6 has acidic Ca2 ? -independent phospho-lipase A2 activity provided by the catalytic activity of Ser32 S32 . We observed that phospholipase activity-dead S32A Prx6 mutant considerably lost its antiapoptotic activity . As this mutant shows a marked change of secondary structure and protein folding , 30 the role of phospholipase activity of Prx6 in TRAIL-induced cell death is not clear yet . Under normal physiological conditions Prx6 interacts with the proform of caspase-10 and caspase-8 through DED , but not with active caspases . It isalso notable that the interaction of caspase-10 and caspase-8 with Prx6 seems to be weaker than that with FADD , implying that the binding affinity of Prx6 to DED caspase is lesser than that of FADD . Thus , it is plausible that upon stimulation with TRAIL , DED caspase dissociates from Prx6 and is recruited into DISC following the high binding affinity to FADD . Previous studies demonstrated that TRAIL treatment triggers the production of reactive oxygen species ROS , resulting in intracellular oxidizing conditions.31 Interestingly , we observed that in vitro binding of Prx6 to caspase-10 was decreased by increased ROS level with the treatment of hydrogen peroxide , but was increased by decreased ROS level with the treatment of ROS scavenger , dithiothreiton DTT Supplementary Figure 3 . Thus , we propose a hypothesis that cytosolic accumulation of ROS also may reduce the binding affinity of Prx6 to DED caspase and enhance the chances of FADD to interact with DED caspases to form DISC . TRAIL receptors are defined as metastasis suppressor proteins that reduce the metastatic propensity of tumor cells.32,33 Inactivation of TRAIL signaling by mutation of TRAIL receptors , DR4 and DR5 , was specifically observed in metastatic cancer , and downregulation of TRAIL receptors promotes metastasis of cancer cells.34,35 Also , metastatic oral cancer cells showed greater TRAIL resistance than their primary oral tumors.36 Recently , caspase-8 has been identi-fied as a metastasis suppressor because of its function as a downstream mediator of TRAIL-mediated apoptosis.37 Suppression of caspase-8 expression occurs during the establishment of cancer metastases . Interestingly , the expression of Prx6 is significantly elevated in highly metastatic breast cancer cells as compared with its parental counter-parts , 23 and overexpression of Prx6 leads to a more invasive phenotype and metastatic capability.22 We also found the overexpression of Prx6 in metastatic gastric cancer cells . Thus , we propose that the elevated levels of Prx6 in cancers may interfere with the dissociation of DED caspase from Prx6 , making DED caspase to be hardly recruited into DISC and causing greater resistance to TRAIL in metastatic cancer cells . These events will confer a metastatic phenotype to TRAIL-resistant primary cancer cells during early metastasis formation . Taken together , our observation that Prx6 regulates TRAIL-induced cell death by binding to and modulating the activation of DED caspases may provide a molecular basis for the role of Prx6 as a negative regulator of metastasis suppressor .

Along with Harry , John Morrison , Elaine Johnson , Abe Clark , Colm O�Brien and many others , Rosario�s work has provided lamina cribrosa astrocyte cellular mechanisms that are biomechanically plausible and in so doing provided credibility to early notions of the optic nerve head ONH as a biomechanical structure . We owe a large intellectual debt to Rosario for her dogged persistence in the characterization of the ONH astrocyte and lamina * Tel . ? 1 503 413 4739 fax ? 1 503 413 5179 .

First , how do astrocytes respond to and alter the biomechanical environment of the ONH and the physiologic stresses created therein ? Second , how do these physiologic demands on the astrocyte influence their ability to deliver the support to retinal ganglion cell axon transport and flow against the translaminar pressure gradient ? The purpose of this article is to summarize what is known about the biomechanical determinants of retinal ganglion cell axon physiology within the ONH in the optic neuropathy of aging and Glaucoma . My goal is to provide a biomechanical framework for this discussion . This framework assumes that the ONH astrocytes and glia fundamentally support and influence both the lamina cribrosa extracellular matrix and retinal ganglion cell axon physi-ology . Rosario Hernandez was one of the first investigators to recognize the implications of this unique circumstance . Many of the ideas contained herein have been initially presented within or derived from her work Hernandez , M.R. , 2000 . The optic nerve head in glaucoma role of astrocytes in tissue remodeling . Prog Retin Eye Res. 19 , 297e321 . Hernandez , M.R. , Pena , J.D. , 1997 . The optic nerve head in glaucomatous optic neuropathy . Arch Oph-thalmol . 115 , 389e395 . . While glaucomatous damage to the visual system likely includes important pathophysiologies within the retinal ganglion cell body Asai et al. , 1987 Garcia-Valenzuela et al. , 1995 Quigley , 1995a Quigley et al. , 2000 , 1995 Weber et al. , 1998 photoreceptors Janssen et al. , 1996 Kendell et al. , 1995 Nork et al. , 2000 Panda and Jonas , 1992 Wygnanski et al. , 1995 , lateral geniculate body Yucel et al. , 2000 , 2001 , 2003 and visual cortex Yucel et al. , 2003 , strong evidence suggests that damage to the retinal ganglion cell axons within the lamina cribrosa of the ONH Bellezza et al. , 2003b Burgoyne et al. , 2004 Gaasterland et al. , 1978 Minckler et al. , 1977 Quigley et al. , 1981 Quigley and Green , 1979 is a central patho-physiology . Recent studies in the monkey Bellezza et al. , 2003b Burgoyne et al. , 2004 Downs et al. , 2005 , 2007 Yang et al. , 2007a , b , rat Cepurna et al. , 2005 Johnson et al. , 2000 , 1996 , and mouse Danias et al. , 2003 Filippopoulos et al. , 2006 Howell et al. , 2007 Jakobs et al. , 2005 Schlamp et al. , 2006 support the importance of the ONH , by describing profound alterations and axonal transport disruption within the prelaminar , laminar and retrolaminar tissues of the ONH at the earliest detectable stage of experimental glaucoma . The ONH tissues make up a dynamic environment wherein 1.2 to 2.0 million RGC axons converge , turn , and exit the eye through the inner Bruch�s Membrane opening and outer scleral portions of the neural canal Fig. 1 . Within the scleral portion of the canal , the bundled axons pass , through a 3-dimensional 3D meshwork of astrocyte-covered , capillary containing , connective tissue beams known as the lamina cribrosa Fig. 1 . Within the lamina , axonal nutrition is thought to depend upon the movement of oxygen and nutrients from the laminar capillaries , through the laminar beam extracellular matrix , across the astrocyte basement membrane into the astrocyte , finally reaching the peripheral and central axons of each bundle , via cell processes Anderson , 1969 . �Cupping� is a clinical term which is used to describe ONH structural change in all forms of optic neuropathy Bianchi-Marzoli et al. , 1995 Greenfield et al. , 1998 Johns et al. , 1989 Klein et al. , 2006 Pederson and Anderson , 1980 Pederson and Gaasterland , 1984 Schwartz et al. , 1975 Sponsel et al. , 2001 . However , �cupping� is also used as a synonym for the pathophysiology of glaucomatous damage to the ONH Anderson and Cynader , 1997 Kalvin et al. , 1966 Quigley and Green , 1979 Vrabec , 1976 . Because the clinical and pathophysiologic contexts for �cupping� are seldom clarified there is a confusing literature regarding the presence , importance and meaning of �cupping� in a variety of disorders Alward , 2004 Ambati and Rizzo , 2001 Bianchi-Marzoli et al. , 1995 Danesh-Meyer et al. , 2001 Greenfield , 1999 Greenfield et al. , 1998 Hall et al. , 2006 Hayreh and Jonas , 2001 Johns et al. , 1989 Klein et al. , 2006 Manor , 1995 Nicolela and Drance , 1996 Nicolela et al. , 2003 Orgul et al. , 1994 Pederson and Anderson , 1980 Pederson and Gaasterland , 1984 Piette and Sergott , 2006 Quigley and Anderson , 1977 Schwartz et al. , 1975 Sharma et al. , 1999 Sonty and Schwartz , 1983 Sponsel et al. , 2001 Trobe et al. , 1980 Votruba et al. , 2003 . Cupping in glaucoma is highly vari-able Nicolela and Drance , 1996 Nicolela et al. , 2003 . We have previously proposed that only �laminar� or �deep� forms of �cupping� those that include a connective tissue component are pathognomonic for glaucoma Burgoyne and Downs , 2008 Burgoyne et al. , 2005 Yang et al. , 2007a . We now further clarify that even a glaucomatous form of �cupping� is only one manifes-tation of the underlying pathophysiologic processes which drive the optic neuropathy of glaucoma . Cupping is therefore a manifes-tation of the neuropathy of glaucoma , not the optic neuropathy itself . Damage to the retinal ganglion cell axon within the ONH is a second component of the optic neuropathy of glaucoma , but it also is not the optic neuropathy itself . While the pathophysiology of RGC axon damage is of fundamental importance in preserving vision , it may be only one component of , or secondary to the larger pathophysiologic events that drive the neuropathy . ONH biomechanics seeks to identify and explain the larger intraocular pressure IOP -related and non IOP-related determinants of glau-comatous damage so as to build a clinical science to predict eye-specific ONH behavior and susceptibility to a given level of IOP Burgoyne and Downs , 2008 Burgoyne et al. , 2005 Burgoyne and Morrison , 2001 Downs et al. , 2009 Sigal and Ethier , 2009a , b Sigal et al. , 2009a , b , 2010b . The biomechanical paradigm of glaucomatous ONH damage does not argue that the ONH is the earliest or only site of damage . ONH biomechanics provides a framework for explaining how IOP-related stress force cross-sectional area of the tissue experiencing that force and strain a measure of local deformation of a tissue induced by applied stress within the load-bearing tissues of the ONH influence the physiology and pathophysiology of all three ONH tissue types . These include 1 the connective tissues load-bearing connective tissues of the peripapillary sclera , scleral canal wall , and lamina cribrosa , 2 the neural tissues retinal ganglion cell axons , and 3 the cells which exist alone or in contact with both 1 and 2 astrocytes , glial cells , endothelial cells , and pericytes and their basement membranes Burgoyne and Downs , 2008 Burgoyne et al. , 2005 Burgoyne and Morrison , 2001 Downs et al. , 2009 Sigal and Ethier , 2009a , b Sigal et al. , 2009a , b , 2010b . ONH biomechanics provides a logic by which non-IOP-related risk factors such as ischemia , inflammation , auto-immunity , astrocyte and glial molecular biology are influenced by or interact with the effects of IOP . ONH biomechanics attempts to combine these �non IOP-related� factors with laminar and peripapillary scleral connective tissue geometry and material properties strength , stiffness , structural rigidity , compliance and nutrient diffusion properties to explain the physiology of normal ONH aging , ONH susceptibility to IOP , and the clinical manifestation of all forms of optic neuropathy . The engineering components of ONH biomechanics have been the focus of a series of recent reports Burgoyne and Downs , 2008 Burgoyne et al. , 2005 Downs et al. , 2009 Sigal and Ethier , 2009a , b Sigal et al. , 2009a , b , 2010b . Figs. 1 and 2 of this article explain a subset of these concepts in greater detail . 4 . ONH connective tissue biomechanics and the translaminar pressure gradient The goal of this section is to elucidate the biomechanical determinants of the translaminar pressure gradient or the transi-tion from intraocular pressure to retrolaminar tissue pressure experienced by the axons as they pass through the lamina cribrosa to exit the eye are illustrated and explained in Fig. 2 . The impor-tance of this gradient to axonal physiology is separately discussed below . The key messages of this and the following sections are five-fold . First , energy is required for axon transport and the translaminar pressure gradient may increase the energy requirements of the RGC axons within the lamina cribrosa . Second , IOP-related stresses and strains within the ONH connective tissues are complicated and do not necessarily lead to deformation of the lamina out of the plane of the sclera . Third , scleral canal expansion that tightens the lamina within the canal and lessens posterior laminar deformation , still increases strain within the lamina . Fourth , posterior deformation of the lamina is likely not required for axon transport compromise . Fifth , IOP-related stress and strain within the ONH connective tissues may independently affect the delivery of nutrients to the RGC axons and therefore affect axon transport in the presence or absence of frank laminar deformation . The difference between Intraocular and orbital pressure estab-lishes a set of principal �engineering� or �mechanical� stresses force cross-sectional area of the tissue bearing the load within the ONH neural and connective tissues , the magnitude of which are determined by the level of IOP and the 3D geometry or architecture of the tissues that carry them Burgoyne et al. , 2005 Downs et al. , 2009 Sigal and Ethier , 2009b . These mechanical stresses are separate from physiologic stress which we define as physical and metabolic changes within a cell in response to alterations in its environment . The direct outward effect of intraocular pressure on the internal limiting membrane of the ONH prelaminar tissues is resisted by the pressure within the retrolaminar optic nerve tissues retrolaminar tissue pressure and the outward expansion of the scleral canal which pulls the lamina cribrosa �tight� within the canal , effectively increasing its resistance to outward deformation Bellezza et al. , 2003a Downs et al. , 2009 . The important concept for this discussion is that engineering models suggest that the stresses generated by the IOP orbital pressure difference within the scleral connective tissues are far higher than the direct outward stresses on the neural and connective tissues of the lamina Fig. 2 Collins , 1967 Downs et al. , 2009 Sigal et al. , 2005 , 2009b . How the ONH connective tissues respond to a given distribution of mechanical stress is determined by their material properties . A growing body of experimental Agoumi et al. , in press Bellezza et al. , 2003a and theoretical work Sigal , 2009 Sigal et al. , 2005 , 2009b supports the concept of a laminar-scleral dynamic in which the net compliance or rigidity of the sclera exerts a large influence over the magnitude of lamina cribrosa deformation at all levels of IOP . While a previous study of ONH surface deformation in dogs suggested substantial ONH surface movement with acute IOP elevation Morgan et al. , 2002 , two recent studies in which laminar deformation was measured directly , suggest little posterior laminar deformation follows acute IOP elevation in normal monkey Bellezza et al. , 2003b Yang et al. , 2009b and human eyes Agoumi et al. , in press . How the axons respond to laminar deformation , when present can not be separated from other axonal effects of the constituent neural and connective tissue stresses and strains . Said in another way , the components of IOP-related stress and strain that drive ONH connective tissue deformation may not be the components that influence axon transport . Glaucomatous damage to the RGC axon within the ONH may not simply occur at locations with the highest levels of IOP-related connective tissue strain or stress . Rather as neural and connective tissue stress and strain increase , axon physiology may become compromised at those locations where the translaminar tissue pressure gradient is steepest Fig. 2 and or where the axon�s energy supply is or otherwise becomes most vulnerable . In these regards , it is important to clarify the separate concepts of the translaminar pressure difference the difference between IOP and the retrolaminar tissue pressure e which generates a net posterior outward force on the surface of the lamina and the translaminar pressure gradient schematically shown in green in Fig. 2 which is the hydrostatic pressure gradient within the neural and connective tissues of the pre-laminar and laminar regions created by the translaminar pressure difference . Note that the in-plane hoop stress transferred to the lamina from the sclera is much larger than the stresses induced by the translaminar pressure difference Fig. 2 . CSF directly influences laminar position through its effect on the translaminar pressure difference . CSF may also effect scleral flange position within the region it projects to the sclera Fig. 2 , but in most eyes , because the projection of the CSF space is minimal this is not likely important Fig. 2 . IOP has a similar direct effect on laminar position , but has an additional and potentially more important effect through the peripapillary sclera Fig. 2 . However , while the magnitude of the translaminar pressure difference may be small relative to the stresses within the connective tissues of the sclera and lamina , the axons separately experience it as the translaminar pressure gradient , the steepness of which is influenced by the thickness of the tissues over which it is experienced . In eyes with thin laminas or in which the lamina becomes thin through the course of the neuropathy , Jonas , 2007 Jonas et al. , 2003 , 2004 Morgan et al. , 1998 , 2008 the translaminar pressure gradient may serve as a primary barrier to axon transport and flow within this region and an important physiologic determinant for the ONH axons and cells . The fact that axon transport blockade within the �scleral� region of the mouse and rat ONH has been reported in multiples studies following acute and chronic IOP elevation Danias et al. , 2003 Filippopoulos et al. , 2006 Howell et al. , 2007 Jakobs et al. , 2005 Johansson , 1983 Martin et al. , 2006 Schlamp et al. , 2006 is important to this discussion for the following reasons . First , it suggests that deformation of connective tissue lamina cribrosa beams is not necessary for axonal transport to be challenged in this location . Second , it suggests that the translaminar pressure gradient , alone , or in combination with the astrocyte and vascular response to it may provide an important challenge to axon trans-port when IOP is elevated . 5 . Retinal ganglion cell axon transport within the ONH The purpose of this section is to identify the principal compo-nents of RGC axon transport within the ONH with emphasis on the delivery of nutrients required to meet its energy demands . Reviews of this subject Anderson and Hendrickson , 1974 Barkus et al. , 2008 Duncan and Goldstein , 2006 Gross et al. , 2007 Minckler , 1994 Minckler et al. , 1977 Morgan , 2000 , 2004 Quigley and Anderson , 1976 should be consulted for greater detail . 5.1 . Axon transport is energy dependant In addition to the conduction of axon potentials , the retinal ganglion cell axons transport molecules , vesicles and organelles in both the anterograde orthograde e away from the cell body , toward the brain and retrograde toward the cell body , away from the brain directions . The axon cytoskeleton forms the molecular tracks for both anterograde and retrograde movement of motor proteins and their associated cargo in addition to maintaining RGC and axon shape . Neurofilaments , microtubules , microtubule-associated proteins MAPs and actin are the major constituents of the axon cytoskeleton . Microtubules are highly polarized structures made up of alpha and beta tubulin that possess a stable �minus� end close to the cell body and a �positive� end that is thought to be more unstable Barkus et al. , 2008 Duncan and Goldstein , 2006 Gross et al. , 2007 Vale and Milligan , 2000 . Physical disruption of the axon cytoskeleton has been reported to occur within 3 h of acute IOP elevations and precede axon transport abnormalities in the porcine eye Balaratnasingam et al. , 2008 . All of the molecular motors for axon transport hydrolyze Adenosine-50-triphosphate ATP to generate movement along the microtubules . Anterograde transport occurs in fast 50e400 mm day and slow slow transport components A SCa .3e3 mm day and B SCb 2e8 mm.day forms . The molecular motor for antero-grade transport is provided by a family of kinesin molecules . The kinesins are synthesized in the cell body and are activated on binding a cargo molecule whereupon they bind to the microtubules and commence movement . Retrograde transport is fast 200e400 mm day and uses dynein as the molecular motor . Dynein is synthesized in the cell body , transported to the axon terminal by both fast and slow mechanisms . It is activated upon binding to its target molecule whereupon it commences retrograde transport along the microtubules . Recently , a second family of vesicular molecular tracks actin filaments and myosin motors have been proposed for both anterograde and retrograde transport Barkus et al. , 2008 Duncan and Goldstein , 2006 Gross et al. , 2007 . Mitochondria move within axons using both the actin and microtubule tracks Brown , 2003 Hollenbeck and Saxton , 2005 to achieve positions in the cell where metabolic support is required such as myelin boundaries Bristow et al. , 2002 and regions of demylenation Mutsaers and Carroll , 1998 . Mitochondrial accu-mulation within , and on both sides of the lamina has been reported to be a feature of normal monkey Minckler et al. , 1976 , cat Bristow et al. , 2002 , and human Barron et al. , 2004 Hollander et al. , 1995 eyes and ascribed to the extraordinary energy requirements of this region Andrews et al. , 1999 Howell , 1997 Morgan , 2004 . 5.2 . Age-related alterations in the retinal ganglion cell axon Vrabec reported the presence of swollen axons within the nerve head at the level of the lamina in cadaver eye specimen from individuals ranging in age from 46 to 80 years , with the number of swollen axons increasing with age Vrabec , 1977 . Dolman et al. 1980 confirmed this finding in patients above the age of 65 , in a separate study of 300 optic nerves from humans spanning the ages of birth to 96 years . In nerves from patients in their seventh decade , three fifteenths demonstrated this finding . In nerves from patients in their eighth decade it was five fifteenths , and from those in their ninth and tenth decades , eight fifteenths . Dolman ascribed the age-related swelling of axons in their study to the combination of age related alterations in astrocytes , blood vessels and axons they described Dolman et al. , 1980 . Johnson found similar swellings in the optic nerves of aged mice Johnson et al. , 1978 . Little is known regarding the actual delivery of nutrients to the retinal ganglion cell axon within the ONH . In the retina Wang et al. , 2002 Yu et al. , 2010 , prelaminar Haefliger and Anderson , 1996 , laminar and retrolaminar ONH Haefliger and Anderson , 1996 astrocyte processes invest the retinal ganglion cell axons and are presumed to be responsible for maintaining the extracellular environment e possessing uptake mechanisms for the removal of potassium and glutamate from the extracellular space as well as providing neurotrophic support . How the retinal ganglion cell axons receive the nutrients necessary to power their mitochondria has not been rigorously studied . In the retina Wang et al. , 2002 Yu et al. , 2010 , prelaminar ONH Haefliger and Anderson , 1996 and brain Gordon et al. , 2007 Mulligan and MacVicar , 2004 astrocytes have direct contact with the endothelial cells of capillaries and it is presumed there is direct transfer in addition to diffusion of nutri-ents Haefliger and Anderson , 1996 . Within the lamina cribrosa of the monkey and human , where each capillary is embedded within a connective tissue sheath Fig. 1 , the astrocyte that envelops the beam and is also respon-sible for the maintenance of its extracellular matrix , is separated from the laminar beam capillary by its basement membrane , the laminar beam extracellular matrix , the pericytes , endothelial cells and the endothelial cell basement membranes . To date , there have been no definitive studies to determine if the laminar beam astrocyte sends a process to the laminar beam capillary . If , in fact , the laminar beam astrocyte does not have a direct connection to the laminar beam capillary , this is the only place in the central nervous system where that is the case . Several important implications follow . First IOP-related stress and or strain may act as a hydrostatic and or compressive pressure and influence the volume flow of blood within the capillaries and or the diffusion properties of these tissues . Second , age and or disease related alterations in the beam and basement membrane connective tissues may enhance these effects . Retrobulbar blood flow within the posterior ciliary arteries is principally influenced by systemic blood pressure and vasospasm . However , IOP-related strain within the peripapillary sclera may significantly affect volume flow through the scleral branches of the short posterior ciliary arteries Langham , 1980 Figs. 3 and 4 . Thus , volume flow through the circle of Zinn Haller and the small pene-trating vessels that pass anteriorly to the prelaminar nerve , trans-versely into the laminar insertion sites , and posteriorly to the pial branches supplying the retrolaminar optic nerve can be theoreti-cally diminished by elevated levels of IOP-related strain Langham , 1980 . Separate from these retrolaminar effects , frank occlusion of the capillaries running within each laminar beam may occur due to tensile , compressive , or shear strains within the beam that are still within the beam�s elastic limits Figs. 4 and 5 . This may be more likely to occur when capillary perfusion pressure has been adversely affected by retrolaminar effects of IOP-related strain or non-IOP related factors such as nocturnal hypotension , diabetes , and retrolaminar vasospasm Hayreh et al. , 1994 Langham , 1980 Spaeth , 1977 . 5.5 . The effects of IOP-related connective tissue stress and strain on nutrient transport from the laminar beam capillary to the astrocyte have not been determined In the absence of a laminar beam astrocyte footplate on the laminar beam capillary , axonal nutrition within the lamina likely requires diffusion of nutrients from the laminar capillaries , across the endothelial and pericyte basement membranes , through the extracellular matrix of the laminar beam , across the basement membranes of the astrocytes , into the astrocytes , and across their processes to the adjacent axons Panel F , Fig.1 . Chronic age-related changes in the endothelial cell and astrocyte basement membranes , as well as IOP-induced changes in the laminar extracellular matrix and astrocyte basement membranes , may diminish nutrient diffu-sion to the axons even in the presence of a stable level of laminar capillary volume flow . The aged ONH is more likely to have stiff connective tissues Albon et al. , 2007 , 1995 , 2000a , b Bailey et al. , 1998 Brown et al. , 1994 Friedenwald , 1937 Hernandez et al. , 1989 Jeffery et al. , 1995 Kotecha et al. , 2006 Morrison et al. , 1989a Pena et al. , 1996 Quigley , 1982 and a compromised blood supply Grunwald et al. , 1993 Harris et al. , 2000 . However , age-related increases in laminar beam thickness Albon et al. , 2000a Hernandez et al. , 1989 , 1991 Kotecha et al. , 2006 Morrison et al. , 1989a , laminar astrocyte basement membrane thickness Hernandez et al. , 1989 , 1991 and laminar extracellular matrix ECM stiffening Albon et al. , 2000a Hernandez et al. , 1989,1991 Morrison et al. , 1989a should not only increase laminar beam stiffness , but also diminish nutrient diffusion from the laminar capillaries into the adjacent axons . While the concepts of age-related optic nerve axon loss Balazsi et al. , 1984 Cepurna et al. , 2005 Cull et al. , 2003 Morrison et al. , 1990 Repka and Quigley , 1989 Sandell and Peters , 2001 , 2002 and an optic neuropathy of aging Frisen , 1991 Jonas and Grundler , 1996 Klein et al. , 2006 McKendrick et al. , 2007 Sandell and Peters , 2002 See et al. , 2009 remain controversial , we believe that the range of physiologic stress and strain within the ONH connective tissues experienced over a life-time are likely to be of central importance to both . Interestingly , Hogan and Zimmerman Hogan and Zimmerman , 1969 proposed that thickening of the retrolaminar septa caused a reduction in the diffusion of nutrients from the contained capillaries to the axons , contributing to age-related loss . Both normal and elevated levels of IOP-related strain can be expected to induce synthesis of extracellular matrix by the laminar astrocytes Agapova et al. , 2003 , 2001 Pena et al. , 2001 , which alters the material properties and likely the diffusion properties of the adjacent laminar trabeculae . Additionally , the laminar astro-cytes and laminar capillary endothelial cells may thicken their basement membranes as a secondary response to the physical distortion induced by laminar deformation . Thickening of the basement membranes of the laminar capillary endothelial cells in response to elevated levels of IOP-related stress was reported in a poster by Hernandez�s group at the 1997 ARVO meeting Pena et al. , 1997 . Basement membranes of the laminar trabeculae have also been noted to thicken with age Hernandez et al. , 1989 . is maximum within the superior temporal and or inferior-nasal quadrants . These phenomena are accompanied by laminar thick-ening , axial elongation , and outward peripapillary scleral bowing in the majority of eyes . We have also reported preliminary evidence of laminar beam thickening Grimm et al. , 2007 . 3D Quantification of Lamina Cribrosa Microarchitecture in Normal and Early Glaucomatous Monkey Eyes . Invest . Ophthalmol . Vis . Sci . 48 , ARVO Abstract # 3295 at this early stage of damage . In addition , Roberts et al have reported preliminary evidence of retrolaminar septal recruitment Roberts et al. , 2009 . However , separate from these phenomena , the lamina appears to actively migrate out of the sclera and into the pia within regions of the most affected eyes Fig. 8 . In some instances complete �pialization� of the laminar insertion is ach-ieved Fig. 8 . Whether the driving event of this phenomenon is mechanical failure of the anterior laminar beams pushing the lamina to seek additional connective tissue support by recruiting the retrolaminar septal tissues , loss of the anterior scleral blood supply or active recruitment of the retrolaminar tissues as part of �remodeling� , the implications of these alterations for the blood supply of the laminar beams , the steepness of the translaminar pressure gradient and astrocyte and axonal physiology are profound . Laminar insertion into the pia has been observed in normal human cadaver eyes Sigal et al. , 2010a Girkin et al. , 2010 . Three-Dimensional Reconstruction of the Human Optic Nerve Head . Invest . Ophthalmol . Vis . Sci . 51 , ARVO Abstract # 3854 . However , laminar migration and pialization as an active component of the optic neuropathy of glaucoma i.e. as an alteration from a previ-ously normal state has not been previously recognized . Our description of laminar migration and pialization within this group of 9 early experimental glaucoma monkeys as well as its contri-bution to the evolution of �glaucomatous cupping� in this species Burgoyne et al. , 2005 Downs et al. , 2009 is in preparation and will be the subject of a future report . Chauhan et al. 2002 described profound alterations of the ONH and scleral canal tissues as well as ERG changes in rats with 1 to 3 months exposure to chronic IOP elevation that were different from those following chronic exposure to endothelin Chauhan et al. , 2004 and appeared to relate to the magnitude of peak IOP elevation and cumulative IOP exposure of the treated eye . Johnson et al Johnson et al. , 2007 reported genomic alterations compatible with cell proliferation , immune response , lysozome , cytoskeleton , extracellular matrix and ribosome in a genomic analysis of the ONH tissues of rats after 5 weeks of chronic unilateral IOP elevation . A 2.7 fold increase in the number of cells in the ONHs of glaucoma eyes was separately confirmed by cell counts . Howell et al. 2007 reported axonal insults within the laminar regions of the DBA 2J mouse at the earliest detectable stages of optic neuropathy . This study confirmed previous work that suggested the �glial� lamina of the mouse eye was sufficient to be the site of axonal disruption Danias et al. , 2003 Filippopoulos et al. , 2006 Howell et al. , 2007 Jakobs et al. , 2005 Schlamp et al. , 2006 but did not elucidate the mechanism . Cytoskeletal , size and Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein GFAP expression changes in astrocytes within regions of the porcine ONH that demonstrated axon transport abnormalities have been reported as early as 3 h after acute IOP elevation Balaratnasingam et al. , 2008 . Taken together these data from monkey , rat and mouse eyes are compatible with the notion of a direct axonal insult by a variety of mechanisms coupled with astrocyte withdrawal of trophic support due to �preoccupation� with or �distraction� by a profoundly altered biomechanical environment Hernandez , 2000 Hernandez and Pena , 1997 Jamara et al. , 2000 . 6 . The mechanisms of retinal ganglion cell insult in glaucoma are likely multifactorial and different by region of the ONH and stage of disease As of this writing , none of the classically proposed of RGC axonal insult within the ONH can be discounted . include 1 ischemia through a variety of mechanisms the tional vascular hypothesis Fechtner and Weinreb , 1994 , physical compression of the axons secondary to the deformation intact laminar trabeculae the traditional mechanical Fechtner and Weinreb , 1994 , and 3 spontaneous compression secondary to tissue pressure differences across intact lamina cribrosa Yablonski and Asamoto , 1993 . All plausible either acting individually or in combination different regions of the nerve head at a given time and or different stages of the disease . Recent work by a series of authors Band et al. , 2009 et al. , 2008a , b Morgan et al. , 2008 , 1995 Ren et al. , Yablonski and Asamoto , 1993 strongly suggest that acquiring energy necessary to maintain the physical integrity of the axon its active transport mechanisms through the translaminar gradient may represent the �final common pathway� of damage the axon in the face of a variety of insults . Steepening this by increasing its magnitude or �thinning� the region through the axons experience it , may increase axonal susceptibility 2007 Jonas et al. , 2004 Ren et al. , 2009 . However , there is also a growing realization that the neuropathy of glaucoma is an active process in which the fibroblasts , laminar astrocytes and glia remodel their to better suit the altered biomechanical milieu in which they themselves Agapova et al. , 2003 Hernandez , 2000 et al. , 2008 Hernandez and Pena , 1997 Johnson et al. , Johnson and Morrison , 2009 Kirwan et al. , 2004 Roberts et 2009 Varela and Hernandez , 1997 Vernon et al. , 2008 . In ONHs , this may represent a small shift out of the continuum of aging Burgoyne and Downs , 2008 that leads to increase in the rate and magnitude of age-related axon loss that they become clinically recognizable as See et al. , 2009 . In others , this is a profound shift that may the astrocytes in a �better� biomechanical environment distracted from their trophic task of retinal ganglion cell maintenance . 7 . Future directions The concepts of the retinal ganglion cell axon being due to ONH astrocyte �distraction� in addition to its being by astrocyte �activation� should continue to be Hernandez and Pena , 1997 . Within this context , as well as the larger discussion of retinal ganglion cell injury mechanisms above , the following research questions are important . 1 Why do primates have a connective tissue lamina and does influence axonal susceptibility ? Is a connective tissue �protective� of the axons is it protective in bigger eyes or longer living eyes , or both ? If it is protective , what are mechanisms and why are they important ? Are rates of related axon loss in mice and rats higher than in tree shrew , and monkey ? Are there detectable differences in the tibility of young and old mice and rats to acute and chronic elevations and is this susceptibility more than in young and tree shrews , pigs and monkeys ? 2 Do astrocytes have processes on the laminar capillaries species with connective tissue laminar beams ? suggested that there were laminar processes and that were withdrawn in human glaucoma in a single article that did not employ electron microscopic characterization Hama et al. , 2004 Varela and Hernandez , 1997 Wilhelmsson et al. , 2006 . What is the relationship of the laminar astrocytes to the laminar capillaries in mice and rats compared to tree shrews pigs and monkeys ? Does this change with age and early disease ? Do astrocytes immediately withdraw their processes from the laminar beam capillaries and axon bundles as part of their initial response to insult ? Can we intervene to stabilize these processes in a beneficial way ? 3 What are the important components of axonal nutrition within the ONH ? How are these altered by age and disease ? Do the laminar beam connective tissues including the beam and basement membrane ECM influence nutrient diffusion and if so how ? Can IOP-related stress and strain within the beams , separate from their ECM influence nutrient diffusion ? If you make the laminar beam stiffer , is there a clinically important effect on diffusion ? Are these relationships changed in age and disease ? 4 Can IOP-related Stress and Strain within the ONH connective tissues directly diminish the volume flow of blood within the contained scleral branches of the posterior ciliary arteries and the laminar beam capillaries ? What are the mechanisms of laminar beam capillary autoregulation ? Liang et al. , 2010 Are they altered in aging and do they falter early in the optic neuropathy of glaucoma ? 5 Do astrocytes migrate away from the beams early in the optic neuropathy of glaucoma ? While Hernandez is often cited on this point , in fact the evidence for this is based on a single figure within a single article Varela and Hernandez , 1997 , is not quantitative , nor was electron microscopy employed Hama et al. , 2004 Wilhelmsson et al. , 2006 . A second assessment of astrocyte migration in cell culture was reported by Tezel Tezel et al. , 2001 . This issue is important and needs to be rigorously revisited . If this is true , are the cells that migrate new cells the result of astrocyte proliferation see below e leaving laminar beam astrocytes and their processes in place or are these the cells that were previously anchored to the beam and have truly migrated away from it ? If so what happens to their beam and axon processes ? Hernandez suggested they were withdrawn but the figure that supports this finding is based on immunohistochemistry and can not be interpreted Varela and Hernandez , 1997 . 6 Do astrocytes proliferate early in the neuropathy of glaucoma ? A growing body of evidence supports the notion that astrocytes within the laminar region of mice , rats and monkeys with experimental glaucoma as well as human glaucoma eyes proliferate Johnson et al. , 2007 Prasanna et al. , 2002 . If this is true , is withdrawal of laminar beam and axon bundle processes part of this process and is axonal nutrition compromised as a result . 7 How many different cell types are there in the ONH and do they have functional roles that separately contribute to the optic neuropathy of glaucoma ? In addition to oligodendrycytes and microglia , two types of ONH astrocytes have been identified Ye and Hernandez , 1995 as well as a separate cell type known as the lamina cribrosacyte Hernandez et al. , 1988 . Are there species differences in these subtypes ? Are there regional distribution differences ? Do these cells consistently demon-strate different patterns of cellular change early in the optic neuropathy of glaucoma ? 8 Can we develop in vivo and or clinical measures of the axon cytoskeleton and transport to assess acute and chronic perturbations of the RGC axon prior to frank structural loss ? A series of investigators are working on in vivo assessments of the axon cytoskeleton Fortune et al. , 2008a , b Huang and Knighton , 2005 Huang et al. , 2006 Fortune et al. , 2009 .

While endo-thelin has been proposed to be a model of ischemic optic neuropathy in a variety of species Chauhan et al. , 2004 Cioffi et al. , 1995 Orgul et al. , 1996a , b , a robust literature has called into question its actual mechanisms He et al. , 2007 Murphy et al. , 2010 Rao et al. , 2008 Stokely et al. , 2002 Wang et al. , 2008 Yorio et al. , 2002 and there are no definitive studies that establish the �glaucomatous� nature of the neuropathy Chauhan et al. , 2004 Oku et al. , 1999 . One paper has reported the �glaucomatous� loss of retinal ganglion cells in rats following systemic exposure to retinal heat shock proteins , but documentation of the �glaucomatous� nature of the neurop-athy has not been provided Wax et al. , 2008 . Because axon loss alone and pre-laminar forms of cupping Burgoyne and Downs , 2008 Burgoyne et al. , 2005 Yang et al. , 2007a , alone , are not pathognomonic for a �glaucomatous� optic neuropathy see above , the following questions should apply to each of these models . What constitutes a �glaucomatous� optic neuropathy ? To what experimental paradigm should these models be compared ? What elements of the neuropathy need to be present to call it �glaucomatous� ?

20849847	Endothelin , astrocytes and glaucoma a r t i c l e i n f o Article history Keywords 1 . Role of astrocytes in neural tissues Astrocytes represent a major component of the glial cell type in the central nervous system . In addition to brain and spinal cord , astrocytes are also present both in the retina and optic nerve , each with distinct regional and functional differences . In addition to their role as neuronal supportive cells by regulating ionic balance , metabolic supply and structural support , astrocytes also perform other critical functions including regulation of neurotransmission , microvascular blood flow to the brain and synaptic plasticity Halassa et al. , 2007 Mulligan and MacVicar , 2004 . Briefly , type I astrocytes express GFAP and connexin-43 whereas type II astro-cytes express GFAP and A2B2 antibody recognizing protein but not connexin-43 Miller et al. , 1989 Radany et al. , 1992 Belliveau and Naus , 1994 . In the eye , astrocytes mainly type I are present both in the inner retina at the ganglion cell layer and nerve fiber layer as well as in the unmyelinated optic nerve head and char-acteristically express glial fibrillary acidic protein GFAP . Type I astrocytes can be further subdivided into Type Ia and Ib based on location as well as GFAP and neural cell adhesion molecule NCAM expression Hernandez , 2000 . Type Ia are GFAP ? NCAM and are interspersed in glial columns forming the edges around cribriform plates whereas Type Ib are GFAP ? NCAM ? and are closer to the * Corresponding author .

Under conditions of neurotrauma or chronic disease , quiescent astrocytes transform into a state of reactivation Fig. 1 Ocularastrocytes retinaltypeIbandopticnerveheadtypeIa are thought to contribute to both homeostatic functions of the retinal ganglion cells RGCs and optic nerve as well directly contributing to the pathophysiology resulting in damage to both ganglion cells and optic nerve . The readers are referredtoan excellent reviewon role of astrocytes and microglia in glaucoma by Johnson and Morrison 2009 . Several factors are implicated in astroglial activation and optic nerve degeneration pertaining to glaucoma including but not limited to peptides like endothelin-1 ET-1 Prasanna et al. , 2002 MacCumber et al. , 1990 Baba , 1998 , cytokines like TNF-a and the TGF-b superfamily including bone morphogenic proteins Yuan and Neufeld , 2000 Pena et al. , 1999 Zode et al. , 2007 L�tjen-Drecoll , 2005 , oxidative stress and advanced glycation end prod-ucts AGE Tezel et al. , 2007 , and trophic factors including GDNF , NT4 5 and Trk receptors Wordinger et al. , 2003 . 1.1 . Astrogliosis characterization and morphological changes The reactive state of astrocytes or astrogliosis is usually defined based on morphological criteria including thickened astrocytic processes and enlarged soma . However , it is becoming evident that the orientation of astrocytic processes in response to a partic-ular stimulus may dictate the reversibility of astrogliosis and is dependent on how acute or chronic the stimulus is and how focal or global the insult occurs Escartin and Bonvento , 2008 . Specifically , astrogliosis resulting from the local disruption of brain parenchyma would promote an extension of astroglial processes along a linear plane demarcating the lesioned area forming an impermeable and irreversible glial scar which can be defined as anisomorphic gliosis Kalman , 2004 . Whereas with a less focal injury as seen in chemical lesions and in chronic diseases , ensuing astrogliosis can be defined as isomorphic gliosis , which may be reversible Escartin and Bonvento , 2008 . Consequently , depending on the type of insult , region of neural tissue affected and duration post-insult , reactive astrocytes can serve either in neuroprotective or neuro-destructive roles . Typical changes during astrogliosis could involve an increase in astrocyte number hyperplasia proliferation , increase in number and length of astroglial processes and cell body size hypertrophy and migration of astroglia . Astroglial hyper-trophy can typically be assessed by visualizing astrocyte morphology and assessing the number and length of astrocytic processes using Lucifer Yellow dye filling and also by immunolab-eling neural tissues for determining the over-expression of inter-mediate filaments , GFAP and vimentin , which are hallmarks of astrogliosis that occurs following neurotrauma and neurodegen-erative diseases including glaucoma Li et al. , 2008 Liu et al. , 2006 Hernandez et al. , 2008 . 1.2 . Astrocytes in glaucoma proliferation , hypertrophy or both ? Astrocytes in glaucomatous optic nerve heads also express increased levels of GFAP and vimentin in addition to possessing rounded cell bodies with thicker processes Hernandez , 2000 . Whether the glaucomatous optic nerve head exhibits a typical isomorphic or anisomorphic astrogliosis remains to be clearly defined . Astroglial proliferation , specifically in prelaminar and retrolaminar pars scleralis regions has been observed in early and moderate stages of glaucoma Minckler and Spaeth , 1981 . Increased immunolabeling for synuclein , a protein associated with mitotic regulation has been detected in human glaucomatous optic nerve heads Surgucheva et al. , 2002 , suggestive of astroglial proliferation in response to glaucomatous insults . Additionally , astrocytes in glaucomatous optic nerve head appear to be migrating towards or present within nerve bundles compared to the orderly and stratified elongated astrocytic processes that appear to surround nerve bundles in normal optic nerve head tissues Hernandez et al. , 2008 . It is also unclear during various stages of glaucoma whether both retinal and optic nerve head astrocytes ONAs undergo proliferation and or hypertrophy . In rodent models of glaucoma , Inman and Horner 2007 observe no astroglial proliferation in the retina of DBA 2J murine model of glaucoma whereas Johnson et al. , 2000 have demonstrated that during early stages of IOP elevation in Morrison rat model of glaucoma , ONAs undergo proliferation . However the following sections emphasize the interactions between astrocytes and endothelins specifically , ET-1 from the perspectives of proliferation , hypertrophy and astrogliosis which can ultimately contribute to optic nerve damage as observed in glaucoma Yorio et al. , 2002 . 2 . Endothelin system in astrocytes Astrocytes , originally thought to be inert structural cells in the central nervous system , have now emerged as important players in neurodegeneration Rossi and Volterra , 2009 . Abnormal activation and or proliferation of astrocytes termed astrogliosis has been observed in various neurodegenerative disorders including Alz-heimer�s disease , Parkinson�s disease , AIDS dementia , traumatic brain injury and glaucoma Rossi and Volterra , 2009 Hirsch et al. , 2003 Hernandez et al. , 2008 . During astrogliosis , there are changes in morphology and function of astrocytes in response to stress and noxious stimuli . Reactive astrocytes upregulate various intermediate filament proteins including , GFAP , nestin and vimentin Eng and Ghirnikar , 1994 Frisen et al. , 1995 . At the site of injury , astrocytes undergo hypertrophy and proliferate forming a glial scar which limits further damage , but also acts as a barrier to regeneration . Reactive gliosis is also characterized by increased glutamate efflux from astrocytes which could potentiate excitotoxic cell death of neurons . Several endogenous agents have been implicated as possible mediators of astrogliosis , including endo-thelins . Endothelins play a key role in many neurodegenerative diseases in which reactive gliosis occurs including Alzheimer�s disease , traumatic brain injury , and glaucoma Zhang et al. , 1994 Jiang et al. , 1993 Yorio et al. , 2002 . Endothelins are a family of vasoactive peptides which exist as three isoforms , endothelin-1 ET-1 endothelin-2 ET-2 and endothelin-3 ET-3 each of which is encoded by distinct genes . Originally isolated from porcine endothelial cells Yanagisawa et al. , 1988 , ET-1 has been shown to be expressed in a wide variety of cell types including kidney , lung , gastrointestinal tract , lung , liver and brain Rubanyi and Polokoff , 1994 . The precise role endothelins play in the central nervous system is not clear it is however clear that ET-1 is expressed in various parts of the brain including paraventricular and supraoptic nuclei in the hypothal-amus , cerebellum , motor neurons in the spinal cord and in peripheral ganglia . Expression in these key areas of the brain suggests that ET-1 has a neuromodulatory role in the central nervous system . In the rat eye , ET-1 expression was first observed by MacCumber et al. 1989 in various tissues including , iris , ciliary body , and choroid . Using in situ hybridization and immunohisto-chemical techniques , ET-1 expression was found in many regions of the human retina including the inner plexiform layer , RPE , photoreceptor inner segment , nerve fiber layer , ganglion layer and astrocytes Ripodas et al. , 2001 . The expression pattern suggests the possibility that endothelins could function as a neuropeptide in the eye to modulate neurotransmitter function in the vertical pathway of the retina . ET-1 acts by binding to two main classes of receptors , ETA and ETB receptors which are G protein coupled receptors belonging to the rhodopsin superfamily . In many instances , endothelin receptors are found in tissues that are in close proximity to the site of ET-1 synthesis and release , suggesting autocrine or paracrine effects of the peptide . While the ETA receptor has been associated with many of the physiological actions of endothelins , the ETB receptor appears to serve as a clearance receptor to regulate the concentrations of ETs in the extracellular compartments Bohm et al. , 2003 . However , activation and over expression of the ETB receptor can also lead to cell signaling , and when this action is persistent it can lead to either beneficial or detrimental effects in the associated tissue , depending on the nature and duration of stimuli . While the role of endothelins in �normal� retinal and brain physiology is not completely understood , a number of observations suggest that endothelins may be involved in astrocyte activation in disease states . Brain astrocytes express several various endothelins including ET-1 , ET-3 , as well as endothelin converting enzyme ECE and the endothelin receptors ETA and ETB receptors Ehrenreich et al. , 1991 MacCumber et al. , 1990 Koyama et al. , 1993 Lazarini et al. , 1996 . In the �resting state� astrocytes express low levels of endothelin components , however , following ischemia , neuro-trauma or pathological conditions endothelins and their receptor expression are greatly enhanced Jiang et al. , 1993 Nie and Olsson , 1996 . Transient global ischemia for 1e2 weeks in the rat hippo-campus produced a significant increase in endothelin immunore-activity along with increased astrocytic proliferation Gajkowska , 1997 . A number of observations link ETB receptor activation to proliferative effects of ET-1 in brain astrocytes Baba , 1998 Ishikawa et al. , 1997 Koyama et al. , 1993 Lazarini et al. , 1996 . Apart from brain astrocytes , ET-1 has also been shown to promote proliferation of optic nerve head astrocytes , but this is mediated through the involvement of both ETA and ETB receptors Prasanna et al. , 2002 Murphy et al. , 2010 . In a rodent model of optic neuropathy using ET-1 perfusion to retrobulbar optic nerve , ETB expression was higher in the ET-1 treated eye , compared to the untreated control eye . The authors observed strong colocalization of ETB and GFAP in the ET-1 treated optic nerve , compared to control nerves Wang et al. , 2009 , suggestive of reactive astrocytes . The authors reported stronger ETB expression in the astrocyte soma and proximal processes , while GFAP was expressed more strongly in the distal processes . Lastly , ECE-like activity has been observed in bovine optic nerve , indicating that local ET-1 production can possibly affect neural , glial and microvascular tissues as well as their interactions Dibas et al. , 2005 . 3 . Factors influencing ET-1 synthesis and release 3.1 . IOP Intraocular pressure IOP is the most well characterized risk factor in primary open angle glaucoma and has been tightly correlated to optic nerve damage and optic disc cupping . ET-1 concentrations have been shown to be elevated both in patients and in animal models of ocular hypertension . For instance , ET-1 concentrations in aqueous humor of primary open angle glaucoma patients were found to be higher than those of normal age-matched control subjects Lepple-Wienhues et al. , 1992 . While the clinical relevance of this finding is not completely clear it appears plausible that ET-1 in aqueous humor could be secreted in response to an increase in IOP . For instance , ET-1 levels were found to be 4-fold higher in the aqueous humor of the congenital elevated IOP canine model of glaucoma K�llberg et al. , 2002 . In the Morrison�s elevated IOP model , Prasanna et al. 2005 reported a 2 to 2.5-fold increase in aqueous humor ET-1 concentrations in rats subjected to elevated IOP , compared to their respective controls . Thanos and Naskar 2004 reported an increase in ET-1 mRNA expression in retinas of rats with elevated IOP . Apart from this , in clinical studies , patients with normal tension glaucoma were shown to have significantly higher 35e70 % concentrations of ET-1 in their circulation in comparison with normal subjects Sugiyama et al. , 1995 Cellini et al. , 1997 . It is possible that mechanical transduction could play a role in ET-1 induction , although the detailed mechanisms are still unclear Ostrow and Sachs , 2005 . For example in porcine aortic endothelial cells , ET-1 synthesis was upregulated nearly eightfold upon being subjected to cyclic stretch Cattaruzza et al. , 2000 . On the other hand , in stretched rat aortic smooth muscle both ET-1 and ETA receptor mRNA expression cells declined , whereas ETB mRNA levels were increased nearly 10-fold . ET-1 10 nM treatment produced apoptotic changes in the stretched rat aortic smooth muscle cells , through its actions on the ETB receptor . 3.2 . Hypoxia Even though endothelins have been shown to be upregulated in the brain following ischemia and brain trauma , the mechanisms underlying these effects are not completely understood . Hypoxia promotes ET-1 expression through hypoxia-inducible factor-1 HIF-1 which has a binding site in the upstream promoter region of the ET-1 gene . Yamashita et al. 2001 demonstrated that AP-1 , GATA-2 and NF-1 play a role in stabilizing the binding of HIF-1 and recruitment of p300 CBP to the regulatory elements of the ET-1 gene . Tezel and Wax 2004 found increased immunostaining for HIF-1alpha in the retina and optic nerve head of glaucomatous donor eyes compared with the control eyes . It is possible that activation of HIF-1 could mediate ET-1 expression in glaucomatous retina and optic nerve head . Apart from ischemia , other factors including thrombin , TGF-b2 and TNF-a have been shown to regu-late ET-1 secretion . Interestingly however , hypoxic condition alone does not cause an increase in ET-1 synthesis and release from optic nerve head astrocytes however , it significantly elevates TNF-a-mediated ET-1 release Desai et al. , 2004 . 3.3 . Tumor necrosis factor-a Tumor necrosis factor-a TNF-a is a cytokine produced mainly by macrophages , but also by a variety of cell types including glial cells . In recent years , TNF-a has gained attention for its role in various neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer�s disease , Parkinson�s disease and glaucoma Tansey et al. , 2008 Tezel , 2008 Rossi and Volterra , 2009 . By immunohistochemical techniques , Tezel et al. , 2001 found increased immunostaining for TNF-a or its receptor in retina sections of glaucomatous eyes than in control eyes of age-matched donors . Using immunofluorescence the authors demonstrated that retinal immunostaining for TNF-a was mainly in glial cells colocalization with GFAP-positive Muller cells and astrocytes , whereas immunostaining for TNF-a receptor-1 was observed mainly in the retinal ganglion cells . This suggests a direct effect of glial TNF-a on retinal ganglion cells RGCs . TNF-a treatment has been shown to produce ET-1 release from human non-pigmented ciliary epithelial cells and optic nerve head astrocytes Prasanna et al. , 1998 , 2002 Desai et al. , 2004 . Narayan et al. 2004 demonstrated increased ET-1 mRNA expression and peptide secretion after treatment of cultured retinal pigmented epithelium with 10 nM TNF-a . These observations suggests that TNF-a could have indirect effects on neurodegeneration which are mediated through ET-1 . Neurodegeneration and astrogliosis could be mediated through a variety of stimuli , including TNF-a and ET-1 . Additionally , ET-1 has been demonstrated to cause RGC death and disruption of axonal transport in the optic nerve supportive of a direct role for ET-1 and glaucomatous neurodegeneration Chauhan et al. , 2004 Stokely et al. , 2002 Wang et al. , 2008 Krishnamoorthy et al. , 2008 . 4 . Proliferation of astrocytes e role for ET-1 There have been several studies dating back to the 1990s right after the discovery of ETs indicating that ET-1 in addition to being a potent vasoregulator i.e. both vasoconstriction and vaso-relaxation was also a potent mitogenic agent for different cell types including smooth muscle and astrocytes MacCumber et al. , 1990 Baba , 1998 . Several papers have also described a putative role for ETs in exacerbation of various neuropathologies and neu-rotrauma via direct actions on neuronal tissues or by altering the bloodebrain barrier e.g . hypoxia , vasospasms , etc. as well as those actions involving astrogliosis Nie and Olsson , 1996 Rogers et al. , 1997 Baba , 1998 Schinelli , 2006 Yorio et al. , 2002 . Specifically , ET-1 being a potent vasoconstrictor and mitogen is considered to play a key role in regulating vascular , neuronal and astroglial interactions . Therefore in glaucomatous optic neuropathy , the establishment of a true cause and effect relationship remains unclear with regards to whether ET-1�s actions are mediated via astrogliosis . ET-1 can also promote neurodegeneration via direct actions on RGC apoptosis and disruption of axonal transport in optic nerve Krishnamoorthy et al. , 2008 Chauhan et al. , 2004 Stokely et al. , 2002 . 4.1 . Endothelin and astrocyte proliferation There have been several seminal reports describing proliferation of astrocytes following exposure to ET-1 either via autocrine actions or exposure to exogenous ET-1 Lazarini et al. , 1996 Rogers et al. , 1997 Teixeira et al. , 2000 Prasanna et al. , 2002 Desai et al. , 2004 Gadea et al. , 2008 Herrero-Gonz�lez et al. , 2009 Murphy et al. , 2010 . These mitogenic effects of ET-1 on astrocytes are observed in murine , rat and human astrocytes isolated from cortical and forebrain tissues , and from optic nerve head . The mitogenic response to ET-1 treatment for astrocytes isolated from different locations has been measured using various end points including expression of Ki-67 , a protein which becomes expressed in all active phases of the cell cycle G1 , S , G2 , or M but not in resting cells Gadea et al. , 2008 Herrero-Gonz�lez et al. , 2009 , incorporation of bromodeoxyuridine BrdU , formazan MTT assay Gadea et al. , 2008 Prasanna et al. , 2002 Desai et al. , 2004 Murphy et al. , 2010 , and [ 3H ] thymidine incorporation Prasanna et al. , 2002 . In these in-vitro studies , depending on the dose and type of astrocytes , ET-1-induced mitogenic response ranged from 25 to 100 % over a negative control vehicle-treatment over a period of 24e96 h post-treatment . ET-1-induced proliferation of human optic nerve head astro-cytes hONAs can be further increased in the presence of hypoxia when compared to that observed under normoxic conditions Desai et al. , 2004 . This finding suggests that astrocytes , including hONAs , are exposed to multiple proliferative stimuli including ET-1 , hypoxia and TNF-a , which can converge upon signaling pathways including ERK1 2 , JNK , and p38 MAPK that ultimately activate cyclin dependent kinases CDKs and promote mitogenesis Gadea et al. , 2008 Desai et al. , 2004 . Recently , Wang et al. , 2008 have demonstrated that following middle cerebral artery occlusion MCAO in rats , astrocyte hypertrophy and proliferation as well as distal occurrence of hippocampal neuronal death occurred in a sequential manner which was inhibited by a CDK inhibitor , olo-moucine . Whether ET-1 or other mitogens for ONAs are contrib-uting to astroglial proliferation in an in vivo glaucoma model or in human optic nerves needs further examination . 4.2 . Role of connexin-43 in astroglial proliferation and effect of ET-1 Connexin-43 is a major gap junction protein that in addition to regulating ionic balance by forming a syncytium also plays a key role in cell proliferation in astrocytes Herrero-Gonz�lez et al. , 2009 . There is evidence to indicate that ET-1-induced astrocyte proliferation is directly dependent on downregulation of connexin-43 , which appears to be mediated via ETB receptor activation Rozyczka et al. , 2005 Blomstrand and Giaume , 2006 Herrero-Gonz�lez et al. , 2009 . It is of interest to note that hONAs have a reduction in gap junctional intercellular communication GJIC and redistribution of connexin-43 under conditions of increased hydrostatic pressure to mimic elevated IOP in glaucoma Malone et al. , 2007 . Such mechanosensation-mediated alteration in ion channel activation and connexin redistribution can cause changes in astrocyte shape due to cytoskeletal remodeling Ostrow and Sachs , 2005 . In glaucomatous monkey optic nerve head tissues , connexin-43 in astrocytes is mainly localized intracellularly whereas in normal optic nerve head tissues connexin-43 is present on astrocyte cell membranes Hernandez et al. , 2008 . In the Morrison rat model of glaucoma , there is a gradual reduction in connexin-43 expression in optic nerve head tissue with increase exposure to IOP elevation from 3 days to 7 days , indicative of disruption of the astrocytic syncitium Johnson et al. , 2000 . Interestingly , in the same glaucoma model Morrison , there was an increased expression of immunoreactive ET-1 and ETB both of which colocalized with GFAP in the rat optic nerve head exposed to elevated IOP Prasanna et al. , 2005 . The overall consequence of reduced or altered GJIC in astrocytes as observed following expo-sure to elevated IOP in glaucoma could result in the disruption of homeostatic function of astrocyteeneuron interactions , which may lead to axon degeneration . Whether or not ET-1-mediated ONA proliferation also involves reduction in connexin-43 expression and consequently results in axon loss in glaucoma remains to be determined . Connexin-43 immunoreactivity has been recently detected in human retinal mainly nerve fiber layer and ganglion cell layer and optic nerve tissues predominantly associated with GFAP-positive astrocytes Kerr et al. , 2010 . Lastly , there appears to be a greater association of connexin-43 loss with astrocyte proliferation than with astrocyte hypertrophy . If ONA proliferation is occurring in glaucoma , it is perhaps an early event in the disease continuum which may also participate and or support astroglial migration that also occurs in response toelevated IOP . In supportof this concept are data from the Morrison rat model of glaucoma wherein , immunolabeling for PCNA , a specific marker of cell proliferation appears to co-localize with GFAP indicative of ONAs that follows a temporal response following 3 days and 13 days of IOP elevation but not later Johnson et al. , 2000 . These findings indicate that proliferation is an early event followed bymigration , extracellular matrix remodeling , etc. in the optic nerve head Johnson et al. , 2000 . Therefore , do the mito-genic factorslikeTNF-a andET-1 contributetotheearlyproliferation of ONA in glaucoma either in response to IOP elevation or directly in parallel with IOP elevation ? It is of interest to note that modulation of connexin-43 levels via various methods have resulted in decreased neuronal cell death following ischemia , neurotrauma , etc. Kerr et al. , 2010 Cronin et al. , 2008 Frantseva et al. , 2002a , 2002b . Another speculation regarding astroglial proliferation comes from a recent finding by Buffo et al. 2008 that some adult astro-cytes in mice cerebral cortex can serve as a source for proliferating reactive astrocytes in response to neurotrauma . Additionally , Casta�eda et al. , 2010 have determined that ET-1 and ETB recep-tors might be associated with regulation of adult neural stem cells and their migration through neurogenic and gliogenic pathways since endothelinergic components are highly expressed in following neurotrauma in adult murine subepyndemal zone . These adult stem cells express elevated levels of GFAP , incorporate BrdU and are also positive for elevated levels of immunoreactive ET-1 and ETB receptor expression Casta�eda et al. , 2010 . Whether a similar population could exist in the optic nerve and respond similarly to glaucomatous insults and mitogen exposure is not known . Thus one could hypothesize that the dual actions of neu-roprotective versus neurodegenerative actions of astrogliosis could also depend on two different situations one involving reactive ONAs experiencing glaucomatous insults IOP elevation , mitogens like ET-1 , hypoxia , cytokines , etc. that cause neurodegeneration while similar glaucomatous insults initiates a different pool of precursor or stem cells causing them to differentiate and proliferate into adult neural or astroglial cells . 5.1 . Astroglial hypertrophy and role of intermediate filaments Very little is known about ET-1�s role in astroglial hypertrophy and reactive gliosis in the glaucomatous optic nerve . However , information from different CNS models may be suggestive of conditions in glaucomatous optic neuropathy . Therefore , from the perspective of astroglial hypertrophy and activation in CNS , Wilhelmsson et al. 2004 have observed that an entorhinal cortex lesion ECL in wild-type WT mice resulted in considerable neuronal degeneration accompanied by astroglial activation and ETB receptor upregulation in the hippocampus , which typically receives axon projections from the entorhinal cortex . In contrast , in mice with intermediate filament knockout i.e . GFAP vimentin GFAP Vim , ECL resulted in hippocampal astroglia having shorter processes , reduced ETB receptor expression on astrocytes and a biphasic response to synaptic regeneration . Acute effects at 4 days post-lesion including loss of synapses in GFAP Vim mice when compared to WT mice and 14 days post-ECL , a signifi-cant and complete restoration of neuronal synapses and reduced hypertrophy of astrocytes was observed in GFAP Vim mice . These findings imply that ETB receptor expression and distribution maybe controlled by expression of GFAP and vimentin and that astrogliosis may fundamentally govern inhibition of neuro-regeneration Wilhelmsson et al. , 2004 . In a more recent report , Li et al. , 2008 performed distal middle cerebral artery transection in WT and GFAP Vim mice which resulted in larger infarct size in GFAP Vim mice after 7 days post-ischemia compared to that seen in WT mice and that ETB receptor distribution was restricted only to the nucleus in GFAP Vim mice . It therefore appears that intermediate filaments like GFAP and vimentin are responsible for production , stability and distribution of ETB recep-tors in reactive astrocytes Li et al. , 2008 . These 2 examples provide evidence for both neurodegenerative and neuroprotective roles for reactive gliosis likely involving ET-1 and ETB receptors . The pres-ence of short astrocyte processes in GFAP Vim mice is in contrast to the long hypertrophied astrocytes processes present in WT mice that usually control several neuro-astroglial homeo-static functions including spatial buffering , removal of neuro-transmitters , repairing bloodebrain barrier , glial scar formation etc. Wilhelmsson et al. , 2004 . In the context of glaucoma , it would be quite interesting to determine the impact of elevated IOP in GFAP Vim mice from the perspectives of retinal ganglion cell RGC damage , astrogliosis , optic nerve damage and effect on the ET-1 system . Additionally since both ET-1 and ETB receptors appear to be elevated in glau-comatous optic nerve tissues in addition to GFAP expression Wang et al. , 2009 , 2006 Prasanna et al. , 2005 , it is possible that temporal changes in ONA function i.e. neuroprotective to neurodestructive or vice-versa could occur similar to above CNS findings . There is a report by Inman and Horner 2007 to indicate that retinal astrocytes only undergo hypertrophy without exhibiting prolifer-ation in a DBA 2J mouse model of pigmentary dispersion glaucoma . These authors however did not evaluate astroglial changes in the optic nerve head in the DBA 2J mice . Whether retinal astrocytes behave differently i.e. hypertrophy only from their optic nerve head counterparts in that only ONAs exhibit both proliferation and hypertrophy in response to glaucoma stimuli remains to be clearly defined in humans , although findings in the Morrison rat model of glaucoma do indicate ONA proliferation occurring early following IOP elevation Johnson et al. , 2000 . Additionally in hONAs , ET-1 has also been demonstrated to cause extensive changes to ECM including expression of fibronectin and changes to matrix metal-loproteinases MMP-2 and inhibitors of MMPs TIMP-1 and -2 He et al. , 2007 . Changes to ECM are another hallmark of hypertro-phied astrocytes in glaucoma Hernandez et al. , 2008 . Recently Lam et al. , 2009 have demonstrated in non-human primates subjected to unilateral ocular hypertension OHT that robust astroglial activation is observed in lateral geniculate nucleus LGN and V1 region of visual cortex following OHT for 2e8 weeks and these changes were accompanied by significant loss of meta-bolic activity . Therefore , another area worth investigating is whether glial changes occurring in glaucomatous brain tissue specifically LGN and visual cortex in addition to those occurring in retina and ONH are also regulated by ET-1 ETB systems and whether these changes result in functional neural deficits . 5.2 . ETB receptor involvement in astrogliosis Typically , hypertrophied astrocytes exhibit upregulated ETB receptor expression in many in vivo models of neurodegeneration including glaucoma Prasanna et al. , 2005 Wang et al. , 2009 , spinal cord injury Peters et al. , 2003 , CNS lesion Wilhelmsson et al. , 2004 and brain ischemia Li et al. , 2008 . It has been previ-ously suggested that blockade of ETB receptor may be a useful strategy to blunt formation of glial scarring after neurotrauma Peters et al. , 2003 and optic nerve damage in response to glau-coma and IOP elevation Prasanna et al. , 2005 . It is relevant to point out that glial scarring is minimized in GFAP Vim mice subjected to neurotrauma Pekny et al. , 1999 . ETB receptor has also been implicated in regulating ET-1-induced cortical astrocyte proliferation since BQ-788 , an ETB receptor antagonist but not BQ-123 , an ETA receptor antagonist , blunted ET-1�s effects Gadea et al. , 2008 . In case of hONAs , both ETA and ETB receptors appear to participate in regulating cell proliferation Prasanna et al. , 2002 . An interesting finding was made in a rat model of glaucoma laser-induced unilateral IOP elevation wherein a time-dependent increase in ETB receptor by 2e6 fold and ET-2 by 1e2 fold mRNA expression was observed in retinal tissues along with TNF super-family member 1A and genes associated with glial activation Yang et al. , 2007 . Elevated expression of ETB receptor mRNA was by far the highest among the 20 genes analyzed in detail by Yang et al. 2007 and furthermore in the same study , none of the aforemen-tioned ET-related and TNF mRNA changes were detected in the rat optic nerve transection model of glaucoma . It is relevant to note that Rattner and Nathans 2005 have observed an upregulation of mRNA expression of ET-2 and ETB receptor 10-fold in Muller glia following 24 h light-induced retinal degeneration . In case of either ET-1-induced optic neuropathy or elevated IOP exposure in rats or primates and in human glaucomatous eyes , ETB receptor is over expressed in the optic nerve head tissues often co-localizing with GFAP indicative of reactive astroglia Wang et al. , 2009 , 2006 Prasanna et al. , 2005 . Furthermore , in human optic nerve head tissues , ETB GFAP colocalization was observed only in the astrocytic processes but not in the cell body Wang et al. , 2009 . This is interesting because ETB present on astrocytic processes provides the possibility that ETB-mediated signaling may lead to downregulation of connexin-43 thereby potentially perturbing astroglial-axon and intercellular astroglial communication , resulting in astroglial proliferation and or hypertrophy in glaucoma . On the other hand , continuous intra-cerebroventricular injection of an ETB agonist , Ala1,3,11,15-ET-1 500 pmol day for 7 days in rats caused an increase in the numbers of GFAP-and vimentin-positive astrocytes in the hippocampus , caudate putamen and cerebrum , which did not induce both neuronal degeneration and activation of microglia macrophage in these brain regions Koyama et al. , 2003 . From the perspective of retinopathies including rat models of retinal degeneration , diabetic retinopathy and proliferative vitreoretinopathy , treatment with bosentan or tezosentan , two mixed ETA B receptor antagonists , prevented neuronal apoptosis , reduced both retinal microvascular basement membrane thickening and retinal gliosis Torbidoni et al. , 2006 Evans et al. , 2000 Iribarne et al. , 2008 . In the context of glaucoma therefore , whether a there is a neuroprotective role for ETB receptor activation early in the process of astrogliosis remains to be determined and b a putative early ETB-induced neuroprotective role ultimately turns neuro-destructive in response to continuous exposure to glaucomatous stimuli also needs to be determined . This again reiterates the need to better understand the relationship of ET-1 , ET receptors , astro-gliosis in the optic nerve head and axon degeneration in the disease continuum of glaucoma . 6 . Conclusions In summary , there are several interesting questions that need to be addressed to further determine the relationship between ET , astrogliosis , and glaucoma . These are Do optic nerve head astro-cytes ONA proliferate in human glaucoma ? If so , when does this occur in the disease continuum ? Can the astrogliosis in glaucom-atous optic nerve heads be classified as isomorphic or anisomor-phic gliosis ? What is the relationship of ET-1 in ONA proliferation in the glaucomatous human optic nerve ? Does ETB receptor-mediated astrogliosis result in a biphasic effect on glaucomatous optic nerve , an early neuroprotective effect followed by a chronic neuro-destructive effect ? Is there a role for connexin-43 and ET-1 in causing and exacerbating the glaucomatous ONA proliferation and or hypertrophy ? What is the consequence of blocking ETB receptors on glaucomatous ONA proliferation , astrogliosis and neuro-degeneration ? Can ET-receptor antagonists be effective in reducing the neurodegeneration that accompanies glaucoma ? How early would we need to identify glaucoma patients for this approach to be effective ? Do glial changes in LGN and visual cortex in glau-comatous brain tissue involve ET-1 ETB system ? While these questions certainly need to be addressed there is a building set of experimental data that suggests endothelins are candidate agents that could contribute to the detrimental neuronal effects seen in glaucoma and drugs that block their action should be considered as target agents for future drug development .

20865012	Review C Liang* , 1 www.nature.com cdd Autophagy , originally described as a lysosome-dependent bulk degradation of cytoplasmic components on starvation , has since been shown to influence diverse aspects of homeostasis and is implicated in many diseases.1 The autophagic cascade is initiated by the engulfment of cytoplasmic cargoes , including long-lived or aggregated proteins , defective organelles , and various soluble molecules , by a double-membraned autophagosome . The autophago-some is then progressively acidified by fusion with the late endosome and the lysosomal compartment to form the autolysosome , exposing the inner compartment to lysosomal hydrolases . Eventually , the inner membrane of the auto-phagosome and its sequestered contents are degraded , with theresultingmacromolecules recycled Figure1 .1,2 Over 30 distinct autophagy-related Atg genes have been identi-fied so far in yeast.3 Many of the genes have their orthologs in mammals.1,3Classical autophagy can be largely divided into several major steps that require specific Atg genes.1 These include a target of rapamycin TOR -mediated induction of autophagy through an Atg1-kinase complex , b initiation of autophagosome formation through a Beclin1-associated class III phosphoinositide PI 3-kinase PI3KC3 complex , c autophagosome membrane elongation and completion , involving two evolutionarily conserved ubiquitin-like conjugation systems�the Atg12�Atg5 and the LC3 the mammalian ortholog of yeast Atg8 -PE phosphatidyl-ethanolamine systems , d autophagosome maturation through fusion with lysosomes , and e cargo degradation through lysosomal enzymes and recycling Figure 1 .1 It is important to note that it is the combined signaling cascades that regulate autophagy , coupled with the concerted action of these distinct steps , that lead to the overall cellular autophagic response . Recently , an alternative autophagy pathway inducible by cellular stress was discovered in mouse embryonic fibroblasts MEFs depleted of the key autophagosomal proteins , Atg5 and Atg7.4 Interestingly , this Atg5-and Atg7-independent autophagy pathway is not associated with LC3 lipidation but seems to specifically involve membranes derived from trans-Golgi and late endosomes.4 Thus , autophagy seems to be far more complex than was previously realized , demanding sophisticated autophagosomal sorting , conceivably encom-passing multiple routes of trafficking while orchestrating regulation of membrane dynamics.1,5 The activation of autophagy is a double-edged sword . On the one hand , autophagy is essential for provoking a protective response and enhancing the cells� adaptation to metabolic stresses and immunological challenges.6,7 In particular , infection , inflammation , neurodegeneration , and cancer can result from pathogen-induced or inherited disruption of the autophagy pathway.6,8 On the other hand , excessive autophagic activation , derailed autophagic traffick-ing , or imbalanced degradation and recycling can give rise to pathogenic conditions by straining critical cellular constitu-ents , leading to cell degeneration and toxicity.9 An example is cardiac myocyte death during ischemia reperfusion , which involves excessively stimulated autophagy and can be alleviated with treatment of 3-methyladenine , an autophagy inhibitor , or knockdown of beclin1 , an essential autophagy effector.10,11 Moreover , although autophagy has been found to retard cardiac hypertrophy by increasing protein degrada-tion , prolonged autophagy seems to have a crucial part in the transition from cardiac hypertrophy to decompensated heart failure , likely because of loss of cardiac mass.11 Indeed , overwhelming autophagic turnover or the build-up of a �traffic jam� in autophagic vacuoles predominates the pathology of many types of myopathy.12 In such conditions , autophagy is not simply a by-product of the cells� recovery program , but rather a phenomenon that can directly contribute to cell pathologies . Similarly , neuronal atrophy , neurite degeneration , and cell death can be exacerbated by the upregulation of autophagy , but are partially reversed by the inactivation of some essential autophagy genes , at least in certain contexts.13 Autophagy may also facilitate pathogenesis of infections.14 Prominent examples include poliovirus , which intercepts autophagy to provide a membrane scaffold for viral replication , 15 and HIV , which hijacks autophagy as a bystander death program for CD4 ? T-cell depletion and immunodeficiency.16 Although it is still a matter of debate whether autophagy is ultimately a protective response or a detrimental process , it seems clear that , if left unchecked , autophagy can lead to adverse effects in cells under certain pathological conditions . Therefore , autophagy signaling and functions are necessities , but ones that must be under tight negative regulation . A series of negative regulators of autophagy have been identified in the past 10 years Table 1 , and a picture of how the balance of autophagy in mammals is achieved is beginning to emerge . It should be noted that these negative regulators do not work as a single entity , but are orchestrated Table 1 Negative regulators of autophagy tBeclin1 Nucleation ND mTOR the gatekeeper of autophagy signaling The kinase mTOR of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase-related kinase PIKK family serves as a key signaling �station� in the regulation of cellular metabolism , which promotes protein synthesis and suppresses the induction of auto-phagy.23 mTOR is found to be part of at least two functionally distinct complexes the rapamycin-sensitive mTOR complex 1 mTORC1 and the rapamycin-insensitive mTOR complex 2 mTORC2 . mTORC1 contains mTOR , along with the sub-units regulatory-associated protein of mTOR Raptor , lethal to function at multiple levels within the autophagy cascade . The timing of autophagy induction is stringently controlled by the nutrient sensor , the mammalian TOR mTOR kinase , which ensures the faithful application of autophagy in the appropriate physiological setting by preventing its direct activation.17 Once autophagy is provoked , the auto-phagy flux can be further restrained at each stage of membrane dynamics nucleation , elongation , maturation , and degradation.2 The overall magnitude of the entire autophagic �wave� is determined by the activities associated with each of the steps illustrated in Figure 1 . The end products of autophagy can serve as a negative-feedback regulatory mechanism to preclude prolonged activity and to synchronize the positive and negative regulation of signal transduction.18 Moreover , the post-translational modification of key autophagosomal proteins provides additional forms of regulation.19�21 Under-standing how autophagy is regulated is important , as it will facilitate the development of new strategies for the control of autophagy-associated pathologies . As many reviews have discussed the positive regulation of autophagy , 22 and as recently negative regulation of autophagy has been inten-sively studied , we herein summarize our current knowledge of the negative regulation of mammalian autophagy and discuss its physiological relevance and potential clinical importance also shown in Figure 1 . with SEC13 protein 8 LST8 , DEPTOR , and proline-rich AKT-substrate PRAS40 . This complex integrates a plethora of signaling pathways that respond to nutrition status and growth factors.24 The second complex , mTORC2 , contains mTOR along with the subunits rapamycin-insensitive compa-nion of mTOR Rictor , stress-activated-protein-kinase-interacting protein 1 SIN1 , LST8 , and DEPTOR . This complex is less understood , but has been shown to be involved in the regulation of actin organization and activation of AKT.25 When nutrients are plentiful , the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway , stimulated by growth factors , affects mTORC1 Figure 1 .24 This triggers a cascade of anabolic processes for cell growth and proliferation , mainly mediated by the ribosomal S6 kinase p70S6 K and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E eIF4E -binding protein 4E-BP , two direct downstream substrates of mTORC1.24 Concomitantly , acti-vation of mTORC1 leads to autophagy suppression.23 This is achieved by direct inhibition of the Atg1Atg13�Atg17 complex , which is required for the initiation of autophagosome formation in both yeast and mammals.23,26 In yeast , TOR activation leads directly to phosphorylation of Atg13 , precluding its interaction with Atg1 to thereby inhibit the biogenesis of autophagosomes.27 In support of this view , expression of an unphosphorylatable form of Atg13 induces autophagy regard-less of TOR activation.27 In mammals , the analogous mTORC1�Atg1 complex axis shows slightly different proper-ties mTOR interacts with the mammalian Atg1 complex , the ULK1 complex , and phosphorylates ULK1 and mammalian Atg13 to inhibit autophagy , whereas dissociation of mTORC1 leads to activation of ULK1 Figure 1 .28,29 As activation of the Atg1 ULK1 complex is essential for most , if not all , cases of autophagy initiation , induction of autophagy can occur autonomously in the absence of any exogenous or endo-genous stimuli when mTORC1 is inactivated or inhibited , as occurs with rapamycin treatment.30 Therefore , mTOR may constitute an early means of limiting autophagy signaling in favor of maximizing the synthesis of proteins , lipids , and nucleic acids for cell growth , most notably in conditions of nutrient availability.24 Under conditions of low energy or hypoxia , mTORC1 is repressed by AMP-activated protein kinase AMPK , which responds to an increased AMP ATP ratio under low-energy conditions , and REDD1 , a transcrip-tional target of HIFa that is stimulated by hypoxia.23,31 Thus , mTORC1 inactivation releases the Atg1 ULK1 complex from a repressed state , leading to the stimulation of autophagy.32 In this context , autophagy-mediated breakdown and recycling of cellular components becomes the preferred route of energy production . On the basis of the central role of mTORC1 in regulating cell growth and proliferation , it is perhaps unsurprising that metabolic signaling upstream of mTORC1 seems profoundly altered in many tumors.33 The oncogenic components in the PI3K�AKTmTOR-mediated anabolic pathway are constitu-tively active in most cancers , whereas molecules known to suppress mTORC1 , including PTEN , AMPK , TSC1 TSC2 , and p53 , are often mutated.34 Accordingly , the mTORC1 inhibitor , rapamycin , and its analogs are actively pursued as a treatment for human malignancies . Despite gaps in our understanding , it is already clear that mTORC1 signaling and its manipulation of the autophagic process represent plausible targets for cancer therapy . Phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate PtdIns 3 P a spatial control of autophagy nucleation Following autophagy induction , signals originating from mTORC1 are resolved in space , to a membrane nucleation site rich in PtdIns 3 P. Recent studies by Axe et al.35 have shown that these PtdIns 3 P-enriched structures denoted omegasomes because of their Olike shape seem generated at the ER membrane , which provides a docking site for assembly of the autophagy machinery . Subsequent study by Halley et al.36 suggested that the outer membranes of mitochondria in mammalian cells can serve as an alternative origin of the autophagosomal membranes , in particular , during starvation-induced autophagy , by providing PE , the lipid target of the autophagosome marker LC3 , highlighting multiple sites of autophagosome nucleation and an intimate connection between ER and mitochondria in autophagy . Notably , production of PtdIns 3 P is mainly governed by the Beclin1-associated PI3KC3 complex , whereas PtdIns 3 P phosphatases mediate PtdIns 3 P hydrolysis to maintain a balanced reservoir of PtdIns 3 P in the cell.37 In addition , there is a level of inhibitory control over the function of the Beclin1�PI3KC3 complex that links the production of PtdIns 3 P with cell survival and apoptosis regulation , exemplified by the roles of Bcl-2 and the recently identified nutrient-deprivation autophagy factor-1 NAF-1 in autophagy regulation.38,39 The level of PtdIns 3 P in a cell must be carefully maintained , as the subversion of PtdIns 3 P homeo-stasis may be a fundamental mechanism in the development of congenital myopathies.37 Jumpy . Jumpy , also known as MTMR14 , encodes a PtdIns 3 P phosphatase that belongs to the myotubularin MTM family . This family contains 15 members of lipid phosphatases characterized by a conserved protein tyrosine phosphatase PTP domain , with specificity for PtdIns 3 P and PtdIns 3,5 P2 in mammalian cells.40 In a siRNA-based screen of MTM family members for autophagy regulation , Vergne et al.41 found that depletion of jumpy , but not of other MTM members , significantly increases both basal and starvation-induced autophagy . Furthermore , Jumpy asso-ciates with isolation membranes and promotes the PtdIns 3 P-dependent recruitment of the early autophagic protein , WIP-1 mammalian Atg18 . In contrast , the overexpression of Jumpy delays traffic out of the autophagosomal compart-ment.41 Although the details remain hazy , these results show that Jumpy is an effective negative regulator of autophagy that drives the reverse reaction of PtdIns 3 P hydrolysis to control excessive PtdIns 3 P-mediated signaling . In vivo , jumpy-deficient mice display muscle weakness and fatigue , a phenotype similar to that seen in patients with centronuclear myopathy CNM , a severe congenital muscular disorder characterized by prominent myonuclei internalization and centralization .42 Consistent with this , Jumpy and another myo-tubularin , MTM1 , have been genetically linked to CNM.43,44 Notably , siRNA knockdown of MTM1 in myocytes fails to give rise to enhanced autophagy , as seen with jumpy , 41 suggesting that the subversion of the autophagosomal PtdIns 3 P balance does not explain all cases of CNM , and disparate patho-mechanisms might be responsible for similar clinical features of CNM . As PtdIns 3 P homeostasis is also critical for endosome trafficking and Ca2 ? metabolism , whether Jumpy-associated myopathies are solely due to an overwhelmed autophagic self-consumption and or aberrant endosome function remains to be tested . Nevertheless , expression of the R336Q missense mutant of Jumpy found in CNM patients completely abrogates Jumpy phosphatase activity and results in an increased level of autophagy in vitro , indicating that aberrant recycling of autophagosomal PtdIns 3 P may contribute , at least in part , to disease etiologies.44 Recently , MTMR3 has been found to regulate constitutive autophagy initiation and the size of autophagic vacuoles in epithelial cells , favoring the idea that autophagosomal PtdIns 3 P regulation might be a shared property of the MTM family.37 Bcl-2 and its assistant , NAF-1 . Unlike Jumpy , which promotes the PtdIns 3 P hydrolysis to negatively regulate autophagy , antiapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins such as Bcl-2 , Bcl-xL , and Bcl-w inhibit autophagy by targeting the ER-associated PI3KC3 complex to restrict PtdIns 3 P production.38,45 The core PI3KC3 complex , including Beclin1 , PI3KC3 , and p150 , exists in at least three confi-gurations the Atg14 complex , which contains an additional subunit of Atg14 , functions at the early stage of autophago-some formation 26,46 the UVRAG-Bif-1 complex , which has UVRAG and Bif-1 also called endophilin B1 instead , facilitates membrane curvature of autophagosomes 26,47,48 and the Rubicon complex , which harbors Rubicon and UVRAG , functions in autophagosome maturation as discussed below.26,46,49 Although the specific function of each individual subunit remains to be established , Beclin1 expression and its interaction with PI3KC3 have been shown to be indispensable for autophagosome formation.50,51 Anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 , Bcl-xL , and Bcl-w bind and hold Beclin1 at bay , thereby preventing Beclin1 from assembling the autophagy-inducing PI3KC3 complex.38,50,51 Consistent with this view , ER-localized Bcl-2 , but not mitochondrial-localized Bcl-2 , confers autophagy inhibition , most notably when nutrients are readily available.38 After stimulation with stress , the negative regulation of Bcl-2 can be overcome by contextually different mechanisms , including the phosphory-lation of Bcl-2 or Beclin1 by JNK or DAP-kinase DAPk , respectively . In addition , the competitive binding of BH3-only proteins e.g. , Bad or pharmacological BH3 mimetic agents e.g. , ABT737 to Bcl-2 releases Beclin1 from Bcl2 inhibition.51,52 Indeed , a Beclin1 mutant that no longer binds to Bcl-2 induces a detrimental autophagy response.38 Thus , the status of the Bcl-2�Beclin1 interaction might be a switch for the Beclin1�PI3KC3-mediated autophagic response in the ER . Shore et al. have recently added another twist to the Bcl-2�Beclin1 crosstalk by showing that ER-associated NAF-1 CISD2 CDGSH iron sulfur domain 2 synonyms ZCD2 , Noxp70 , and Miner1 is required for Bcl-2�Beclin1 interaction and Bcl-2 inhibition of autophagy at the ER.53 Knockdown of NAF-1 diminishes the Bcl-2 binding to Beclin1 and triggers autophagy.50,53 Unlike Beclin1 , NAF-1 does not engage the conventional hydrophobic BH3-binding pocket on the Bcl-2 surface for binding . Moreover , the ER-restricted proapoptotic BH3-only protein , Bik , can displace NAF-1 from Bcl-2 and induce autophagy.50,53 A plausible explanation of this finding is that NAF1 might bind to a hitherto unknown site on Bcl-2 to facilitate a conformational change needed for an efficient Beclin1 interaction . This may be reversed by Bik because of its competitive affinity for Bcl-2 . Of special note , depletion of NAF-1 seems to have a minimal effect on the steady-state level of autophagy , but autophagy is strongly evoked in starved cells with an unusual distribution of LC3 at membrane blebs and filopodia.53 This indicates that the loss of NAF-1 might influence both the magnitude and spatial control of Beclin1-mediated autophagy flux . Consistently , Cisd2 naf-1 deficiency in mice causes autophagic cell death in multiple tissues accompanied by a panel of premature aging phenotypes.54 Similar to Bcl-2,55 NAF-1 is found in physical association with the inositol 1,4,5trisphosphate IP3 receptor IP3R , an IP3 sensor and an ER-Ca2 ? efflux channel , and is required for the Bcl-2-mediated depression of ER Ca2 ? store.53 It should be noted that IP3R also regulates autophagy and that the antagonists e.g. , xestospongins of IP3R strongly induce autophagy.56 Intriguingly , such an effect of IP3R on auto-phagy seems to be irrelevant to its regulation of intracellular Ca2 ? levels but is dependent on Beclin1 interaction.57 Whether the dual roles of NAF-1 in Bcl-2-mediated Beclin1 inhibition and IP3 receptor activity represent two sides of the same coin or are functionally independent regulatory mechan-isms remains to be further tested . Nevertheless , the coordi-nated regulation of autophagic flux with Ca2 ? metabolism by the NAF-1 Bcl-2 complex and IP3 receptor integrates autophagy into the broader cellular signaling network . Not surprisingly , tumors exploit these mechanisms to gain a selective advantage . For example , cancer cells often express more Bcl-2 to prolong the inhibition of apoptosis and autophagy to ensure cancer cell proliferation , in much the same way as herpesviruses , such as g-Herpesvirus 68 , maintain their latent infections in host cells.52,58 Recent study by Furuya et al.59 adds another piece to the regulation of the PtdIns 3 P production , showing that cycline-dependent kinases Cdks including Cdk1 and Cdk5 can phosphorylate PI3KC3 on Thr159 , which inhibits PI3KC3 interaction with Beclin1 and negatively regulates autophagy . This study thus provides a mechanism by which autophagy is controlled in cell cycle progression . FLIP FLICE-like inhibitory protein and cleaved Atg5 brakes for membrane elongation Autophagosome membrane elongation involves two ubiquitin-like conjugation systems LC3 mammalian Atg8 -PE phophatidylethanolamine conjugation and Atg12�Atg5 con-jugation.60 After proteolytic cleavage of its carboxy terminus by the Atg4 cysteine protease , LC3 is conjugated to the membrane lipid PE after sequential processing by Atg7 E1-like enzyme and Atg3 E2-like enzyme .60 In this conjugation process , FLIP tunes the interaction between ubiquitin-like LC3 and Atg3.61 Meanwhile , Atg12 is conjugated to Atg5 in a similar manner , except that Atg10 instead of Atg3 is used as the E2 enzyme . Furthermore , under the control of calpain-mediated cleavage , the membrane elongation factor , Atg5 , can switch from an autophagy mode to an apoptosis mode on apoptotic stimulation.19 FLIP�s flipping autophagy . Cellular caspase-8 FLICE -like inhibitory protein cFLIP was originally identified as an inhibitor of cell-surface death-receptor signaling induced by tumor necrosis factor TNF , CD95 ligand CD95 L also known as FASL , and TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand TRAIL .62 Two predominant splice variants of the FLIP gene , the long form cFLIPL and the shorter form cFLIPS , have been identified . Both forms are capable of protecting cells from apoptosis through competition with procaspase-8 for the recruitment to FAS-associated death domain FADD , thereby preventing initiator caspase-8 activation.62 In addition , both cFLIP and viral FLIP orthologs vFLIP have a prominent role in potently inducing NFkB signaling through the engagement of the IKKg regulatory subunit of the IkB kinase IKK complex.63,64 These observations seem to indicate that various primary tumor cells and tumors with resistance to death ligands , such as TRAIL , will benefit from enhanced expression of the antiapoptotic and pro-inflammatory FLIP protein.65 Recent studies by Lee et al.61 have revealed a second important function of both c-FLIP and v-FLIP as effective regulators of autophagy . FLIP depletion by siRNA exagge-rates the effect of rapamycin and results in autophagic cell death , whereas the overexpression of FLIP inhibits both starvation and rapamycin-induced autophagy.61 The mecha-nism of inhibition was found to involve the altering of Atg3 and LC3 interactions during autophagosome elongation . The presence of FLIP competes with LC3 for Atg3 binding and thereby perturbs the lipidation of LC3 , but this can be alleviated under stress conditions . As with Bcl-2 , this action of FLIP might help maintain the level of autophagy within a physiological range compatible with cell survival and clear-ance of defective organelles . Interestingly , they identified a mutant FLIP that is defective in both NFkB activation and apoptosis inhibition but remains capable of blocking auto-phagy as efficiently as wild-type FLIP , suggesting that the antiautophagic role of FLIP is genetically separable from its previously identified antiapoptotic and NFkB activation functions . Thus , it is conceived that autophagy inhibition by FLIP represents a �direct hit� on essential autophagy proteins such as Atg3 , rather than an �indirect output� by way of interfering with other signaling pathways.61 Calpain-mediated Atg5 cleavage two birds , one stone . Post-translational modification of Atg5 , a key autophagy effector protein , provides additional insight into the molecular mechanisms of how autophagy is nega-tively regulated under normal nutritional conditions and in response to stress stimuli.19 Atg5 forms a high-order protein conjugation complex with Atg12 and Atg16 , which is essential for autophagosome membrane elongation . Surprisingly , Yousefi et al.19 found that Atg5 also sensitizes tumor cells to various apoptotic stimuli that are not due to enhanced autophagy . In an effort to understand how Atg5 exerts this effect , Yousefi et al.19 identified a cleaved form of Atg5 produced from full-length Atg5 by calpain , a family of Ca2 ? -dependent non-lysosomal cysteine proteases , in cells exposed to apoptotic stimuli . Atg5 cleavage obliterates its autophagy activity . Instead , the truncated Atg5 translocates to the mitochondria , wherein it associates with Bcl-xL and somehow induces apoptosis . This mechanism has a dual effect in signaling it enables the direct attenuation of the autophagy response by downregulating Atg5�Atg12 conjugation , while generating unique signals that propagate to mitochondria for the induction of apoptosis . On the basis of this observation , Atg5 cleavage seems to function as a critical switch from protective autophagy to cell death in the presence of apoptotic stimuli . Congruous results were recently provided by Xia et al.66 further demonstrating that calpain1-mediated cleavage of Atg5 can modulate autophagy by adjusting the level of Atg5�Atg12 conjugation in normal cells . Besides Atg5 , Beclin1 has also been found to be cleaved by caspases during apoptosis , blunting the autophagy process to promote the apoptotic response.20,21 Taken together , these findings indicate a critical role for autophagy proteins Atg5 and Beclin1 in the crosstalk between autophagy and apoptosis , while adding calpain and caspases to the growing list of negative regulators of the autophagy track . Rubicon gatekeeper of autolysosomal traffic The autophagosome �matures� through multiple transient interactions with endosomal compartments and lysosomes , to form a hybrid-like organelle called the autolysosome . The primary function of the autolysosome is to degrade autophagocytosed materials . Along this line , maturation can be an inherently dangerous business , as any misdelivery of cargo to the lysosome can lead to improper proteolytic activation . Currently , little is known about what �prepares� an autophagosome for fusion with a lysosome and what relevant �signals� are involved . However , recent studies point to an important negative regulatory mechanism in autophagosome maturation that is mediated by Rubicon RUN domain and cysteine-rich domain containing , Beclin1-interacting protein . Rubicon , along with Atg14 , was independently identified by two laboratories46,49 as a novel Beclin1 interactor . Although Atg14 seems conserved from yeast to humans , no yeast counterpart for Rubicon has been found.67 Furthermore , unlike Atg14 , which promotes the early stage of autophago-some biogenesis by forming a complex with Beclin1 and PI3KC3 , Rubicon negatively regulates a downstream stage of autophagosome maturation by joining the UVRAG , Beclin1 , and PI3KC3 complex Figure 1 . Overexpression of Rubicon results in the accumulation of p62 , an autophagy cargo , whereas Rubicon depletion induces p62 degradation , suggesting that its overall function is in the inhibition of autophagy.49 In addition , both studies report that the acidi-fication of LC3-II-associated vesicles is severely impaired upon the overexpression of Rubicon , 46,49 indicating that Rubicon expression may restrict autophagic flux to lyso-somes . It is currently not clear how Rubicon affects autophagy maturation and its role in diseases remains to be explored . Although Rubicon is largely considered to be an autophagy-related protein , it is not exclusively present in autophago-somes . Rather , a large portion of Rubicon is present in endosomal compartments.46,49 Consistent with this obser-vation , Matsunaga et al.46 found that Rubicon also has a role in endocytic trafficking . Overexpression of Rubicon causes defects in endocytic trafficking , whereas the knock-down of Rubicon is associated with enhanced trafficking and degradation of epidermal growth factor receptor EGFR . Given the previous finding that UVRAG facilitates lysosomal-directed membrane dynamics , 68 one could speculate that Rubicon potentially restricts the endocytic forward trafficking to the lysosome by antagonizing UVRAG . Alternatively or additionally , Rubicon may work in concert with UVRAG through different mechanisms to maintain a net balance of overall autophagic flow . Thus , Rubicon may constitute an important component in both autophagic and endocytic trafficking . Amino acids negative feedback loop of autophagy Autophagy is a unique process that degrades long-lived proteins , as well as protein aggregates , to replenish the intracellular amino acid pool , especially in nutrient-deprived cells.23 Indeed , ablation of essential autophagy genes , such as Atg7 , significantly dampens the level of intracellular amino acids , as is phenocopied in cells treated with protein synthesis inhibitors.69 Conversely , increased intracellular free amino acids produced during autophagic degradation can reactivate the mTORC1 signaling and thus downregulate autophagy , serving as a self-limiting feedback loop in autophagy regula-tion.70,71 Using the Xenopus laevis oocyte as a model , it has been shown that mTORC1 can sense small increases in intracellular amino acids such as leucine , which leads to increased phosphorylation of both p70S6 kinase and its downstream target , ribosomal protein S6.72 Notably , such effects of amino acids on mTORC1 can be independent of stimulation by insulin or other growth factors , but are dependent on autophagic proteolysis.73 A recent study by Yu et al.71 also showed that mTOR signaling is reactivated by prolonged starvation , which attenuates autophagy and restores lysosome homeostasis . This negative feedback loop is envisioned to be part of a homeostatic mechanism required to prevent prolonged or overactivation of autophagy . The �Yin-Yang� face of p53 in autophagy The tumor suppressor p53 is often considered the cellular gatekeeper because of its role in sensing and synchronizing numerous stress conditions with cell cycle arrest , DNA repair , senescence , cellular metabolism , apoptosis , and autophagy , in both a transactivation-dependent and or -independent manner.74 Given the views of autophagy as a cellular stress response , it is unsurprising that several studies have shown that p53 can directly activate autophagy.75�77 The exact mechanism by which p53 promotes autophagy is not clear , but relates to the ability of p53 to transactivate a group of critical factors that arrest mTOR-mediated anabolic metabo-lism , including IGF-BP3 , PTEN , TSC2 , AMPKb1 b2 , and sestrins1 2 Figure 2 .74�76 Each of these attenuates mTOR signaling and therefore counteracts its repression of auto-phagy . Damage-regulated autophagy modulator DRAM is a p53 transcriptional target and has also been found to positively regulate autophagy.78 Along this line , any impairment of p53 function leads to deregulation of the autophagy signaling pathway and may confer tumorigenesis . However , p53�s role as an autophagy regulator remains enigmatic , because recent studies by Tasdemir et al. have shown that , in addition to promoting autophagy , p53 also inhibits this process.79 Depletion or pharmacological inhibition of basal levels of p53 in various cell lines , as well as in vivo in mice and Caenorhabditis elegans , was found to induce autophagy , and this increased autophagy conferred resistance to metabolic stress in p53-deficient cells . The mechanism by which p53 suppresses autophagy is not clear , but it seems independent of its transactivation activities.79 Further molecular dissection of p53 by Tasdemir et al. revealed that it is the cytoplasmic p53 , not nuclear p53 , that mediates suppression of autophagy , reflecting the spatial control of p53 signaling Figure 2 . At first glance , the antiautophagic effects of cytoplasmic p53 can not be easily reconciled with the view of autophagy as a tumor suppressor mechanism . Yet , many tumor-derived , cytoplasm-restricted forms of p53 are highly oncogenic , which may be partially due to their negative regulation of autophagy , at least in certain contexts.80 Thus , the regulation of autophagy by p53 is multifaceted stress-induced activation of p53 promotes autophagy , whereas physiological levels of p53 repress autophagy . The dual effects of p53 reflect the coordinated regulation of cellular metabolism , including autophagy , which can be subverted blunt the positive role �yang� of nuclear p53 or capitalized on amplify the negative role �yin� of cytoplamsic p53 in malignant transformation . The pervasiveness and strength of autophagy necessitates the complexity of its negative regulation . Over the past 10 years , an extensive array of negative regulators that limit the amplitude and duration of the autophagic response to confine it to a prescribed range has been identified.1�3 Defects in these endogenous autophagy inhibitory processes can cause cell toxicity , tissue injury , and predispose the host to many atrophic diseases.12 Conversely , insufficient activation of autophagy causes the accumulation of undesirable components , which can fuel inflammation , trigger necrosis , and induce genomic instability , features underlying the hallmarks of cancer , neurodegeneration , and aging.1,6,8 Thus , it is important to envisage autophagy as a tightly regulated dynamic , not only for autophagy per se , but also in the context of its broad connection to other signaling or metabolic pathways . Learning to manipulate this regulatory process of autophagy in the right contexts represents an exciting new challenge . It is likely to generate important advances in our understanding of how autophagy is integrated at a broader level into the cellular network of signaling circuits and how this affects a range of cognitive processes , and is also critical for devising successful therapies for autophagy-associated diseases .

Schematic representation of the autophagy pathway and its negative regulation in mammalian cells . Autophagy proceeds through a series of steps including signal transduction , membrane nucleation , elongation , and completion of the autophagosome , autophagosome maturation by fusion with a lysosome , followed by degradation of autophagic cargoes , and recycling of the resulting molecules . Negative regulation occurs at each dynamic step . Autophagy induction is directly and tightly controlled by the �nutrient sensor� mTOR , which senses and integrates signals from numerous sources including growth factors , amino acids , hypoxia , and energy levels . Under nutrient-rich conditions , mTOR associates with the ULK1 complex comprised of ULK1 mammalian Atg1 , mammalian Atg13 mAtg13 , and FIP200 mammalian Atg17 , and phophorylates ULK1 and mAtg13 to repress autophagy . On inactivation of mTOR by upstream signaling , it dissociates from the ULK1 complex , triggering the autophagy cascade . Autophagosome nucleation is confined to phosphatidylinositol-3phosphate PtdIns 3 P -containing vesicles and is driven by the Beclin1-associated PI3KC3 complex . The antiapoptotic Bcl-2 and its interactor , NAF-1 , negatively regulate autophagy by sequestering Beclin1 from the complex , thereby restricting the production of PtdIns 3 -P . Similarly , the PtdIns 3 -P phosphatase , Jumpy , catalyzes the reverse reaction of PtdIns 3 -P hydrolysis to inhibit autophagy . Beclin1 can also be cleaved by caspases , which destroys its proautophagic activity . Two ubiquitin-like conjugation systems are involved in autophagosomal membrane expansion and completion one is LC3�phosphatidylethanolamine PE conjugation and the other is Atg12�Atg5 conjugation . The interaction of LC3 with the E2-like enzyme , Atg3 , is inhibited by FLIP , whereas Atg5 cleavage by calpain attenuates Atg5�Atg12 conjugation , resulting in apoptosis through the formation of a complex with Bcl-xL in the mitochondria . Autophagosome fusion with the lysosome signifies the maturation stage of autophagy , a step that is least understood but found to be suppressed by the Rubicon complex Rubicon�UVRAG�Beclin1�PI3KC3�p150 . Finally , the end products of proteolysis suppress autophagy by upregulating mTOR signaling , serving as a negative feedback loop Figure 2 The �Yin-Yang� face of p53 in autophagy regulation .

Introduction Glaucoma is one of the leading causes of blindness in the western world . The disease is characterized by a progressive loss of retinal ganglion cells and their axons associated with tissue remodeling in the optic nerve head ONH . In affected patients , this manifests as characteristic visual field deterioration . In addition to increased intraocular pressure IOP , which is the most important factor for primary open angle glaucoma POAG , impaired ocular blood flow regulation also seems to be involved in the disease process Flammer et al. , 2002 . The present review summarizes some of the present knowledge about autoregulatory processes in the eye and discusses its relevance for glaucoma . 2 . Ocular perfusion pressure and glaucoma Perfusion pressure is defined as the difference between arterial and venous blood pressure and is the driving force of blood flow . Since in the eye venous pressure is equal to or slightly higher than IOP Glucksberg and Dunn , 1993 Maepea , 1992 , ocular perfusion pressure OPP can be estimated as the difference between arterial blood pressure and IOP . Therefore both , a high IOP and a low systemic blood pressure , can lead to a reduced OPP Leske , 2009 . Low OPP may lead to reduced ocular blood flow and in turn to ischemia and or hypoxia , but the relation between OPP and blood flow in the eye is complex . Large epidemiologic studies have shown that low OPP is a risk factor for the prevalence , incidence and progression of glaucoma . Low systemic blood pressure leading to low OPP was found to be a risk factor for the development of glaucoma in the Barbados Eye Studies Leske et al. , 2008 . In a study conducted in 4774 Hispanic subjects , subjects with low OPP were also more likely to have glaucoma Quigley et al. , 2001 . In the Egna-Neumarkt Study , lower diastolic perfusion pressure was associated with an increase in the frequency of glaucoma Bonomi et al. , 2000 . The Early Manifest Glaucoma Trial EMGT reported that patients with low systolic OPP show an almost 50 % higher risk for progression of the disease Leske et al. , 2007 . In the Thessaloniki Eye study diastolic blood pressure lower than 90 mmHg due to systemic hypertension treatment was associated with increased cup area , decreased rim area and increased cup to disc C D ratio of the optic disc in subjects not previously diagnosed with glaucoma . This was not found in subjects with no hypertensive treatment and a diastolic blood pressure lower than 90 mmHg or with a diastolic blood pressure level higher than 90 mmHg . However , one has to keep in mind that the target diastolic blood pressure achieved by anti-hypertensive therapy should be below 80 mmHg World Health Organization , 2007 Topouzis et al. , 2006 . In the Beijing Eye Study , however , no correlation between OPP and glaucoma was found Xu et al. , 2009 . There is evidence from smaller non-population based studies that in addition to low systemic blood pressure , abnormal nocturnal blood pressure dipping plays a role in the disease process . Nocturnal dipping is a physiological process , where systolic blood pressure decreases by 10e12 % and diastolic blood pressure by 14e17 % during the sleeping hours . A reduced nocturnal decline in blood pressure is defined as non-dipping and is accom-panied by an increased cardiovascular risk Birkenhager and van den Meiracker , 2007 Weir and Blantz , 2003 . If this is also true for patients who show an increased nocturnal blood pressure dipping , remains controversial Fagard et al. , 2009 Kario et al. , 2001 . In glaucoma evidence is increasing that unphysiological dipping or an instable blood pressure situation in general may be associated with the disease . Kaiser et al. 1993 monitored 24 h blood pressure in POAG patients , normal-tension glaucoma NTG patients and healthy controls . Patients with POAG or NTG that showed progression despite well-controlled IOP had a significantly reduced systolic blood pressure during the 24 h time period Kaiser et al. , 1993 . Collignon et al. 1998 followed 51 POAG patients and 19 NTG patients for a period of 2 years . They analyzed the nocturnal dip of systolic blood pressure . Subjects with a dip of less than 5 % where defined as non-dippers , those with a dip of 5e10 % as dippers , and subjects with dips higher than 10 % as big dippers . There were statistically significant more non-dippers and big dippers in the group of patients with progressing disease than among patients with a stable visual field . This suggests that nocturnal dipping is a predictive factor of disease progression in patients with POAG and NTG Collignon et al. , 1998 . In another study 15 POAG patients and 23 NTG patients were investigated for a mean follow up time of 4 years , the presence of abnormal nocturnal dipping was correlated against the progression of visual field defects . In keeping with the data of the Collignon study the proportion of patients with worsening visual field was significantly higher in the non-dippers and the extreme dippers than in the dippers Tokunaga et al. , 2004 . As mentioned before , low systemic blood pressure , but also high IOP can lead to decreased OPP . Some studies indicate that IOP fluctuation is a risk factor for visual field progression , regardless of the absolute IOP level . The term short-term IOP fluctuation is used for IOP fluctuations measured over a 24 h period or less . IOP fluctuations over a longer time period are referred to as long-term IOP fluctuations Sultan et al. , 2009 . Because of these different definitions and the measurement regimes that come with those , interpretation of studies investigating IOP fluctuation is difficult . In clinical practice , IOP is mostly measured in the upright position . However , it has been demonstrated that IOP is influenced by body position and that higher readings are found in the supine position Singh and Shrivastava , 2009 . In healthy individuals nocturnal IOP values were higher than during the daytime Liu et al. , 2005 Mosaed et al. , 2005 . In glaucoma patients , the 24 h IOP pattern seems to be different , with a peak during the daytime Liu et al. , 2003 . While short-term IOP fluctuations are becoming of increasing interest in the clinical management of glaucoma Bagga et al. , 2009 , the role of long-term IOP fluctuation in the disease process remains controversial . In the Advanced Glaucoma Intervention Study AGIS , long-term IOP fluctuation was an independent and stronger predictor of visual field damage progression than mean IOP Caprioli and Coleman , 2008 . Similar results were found by Lee et al in a retrospective study Lee et al. , 2007 . By contrast , in the EMGT , elevated IOP was a strong factor for glaucoma progression , while no correlation between long-term IOP fluctuation and disease progression was found . The authors explained this finding by the fact that in the AGIS only patients with uncontrolled IOP and maximally tolerated medical treatment were included , where larger fluctuations in IOP could be caused by more intensive treatments . In contrast , the EMGT study population consisted of newly diagnosed patients , where no changes in patient manage-ment occurred during the study period Bengtsson et al. , 2007 . Circadian variations in OPP due to both IOP fluctuations and mean arterial blood pressure MAP fluctuations may play a role in the disease process . Sehi et al. 2005 measured IOP fluctuations and MAP fluctuations between 7 00 AM and 10 00 PM in both untreated POAG patients and healthy subjects . They found that the mean OPP in POAG patients was significantly lower than in healthy control subjects throughout the day . The absolute diurnal change in mean OPP was significantly greater in the POAG group . Assessment of diurnal variation of mean OPP therefore might be a useful tool for early glaucoma diagnosis Sehi et al. , 2005 . Instability of 24 h mean OPP may be a risk factor in development of NTG Choi et al. , 2006 . A study conducted in 113 NTG patients found that circadian mean OPP fluctuation was the most consistent clinical risk factor in determining glaucoma severity Choi et al. , 2007 . In a retrospective study investigating 101 NTG patients , 24 h mean OPP fluctuations were significantly associated with greater visual field progression , suggesting that mean OPP fluctuation is a prognostic factor for glaucoma progression Sung et al. , 2009 . This is in accordance with another trial where lower nighttime blood pressure or MAP was associated with worse structural and functional glaucomatous damage in patients with NTG Joe et al. , 2009 . Glaucoma patients also seem to show larger diurnal fluctuation of ocular blood flow compared to healthy controls . In a study conducted in 15 POAG patients and 15 healthy control subjects , this was observed with different techniques for measurement of ocular blood flow Pemp et al. , 2009 . 3 . Assessment of autoregulation 3.1 . Humans In humans , several methods for measuring ocular blood flow are available . Most of these techniques are used in clinical studies and not in routine patient care because of technical limitations and the high amount of training required for the personnel . In the present review only a short overview of techniques is given . More details can be found in other review papers Garzozi et al. , 2001 Harris et al. , 2008 Schmetterer and Garhofer , 2007 . Color Doppler Imaging CDI , an ultrasound technique that combines B-scan images with velocity information obtained from the Doppler shift of the moving erythrocytes can be used for the assessment of blood velocity of retrobulbar vessels . Using this technique , the peak systolic PSV , mean MV , and end-diastolic velocities EDV for the central retinal artery , the posterior ciliary vessels , and the ophthalmic artery can be measured Lieb , 1993 . Out of these parameters , the resistive index RI , a measure for peripheral vessel resistance , can be calculated . However , the meaning of this parameter in the ocular vasculature remains uncertain and is still a matter of controversy Polska et al. , 2001 . Moreover , calculation of total blood flow is not possible with this technique , since no quantitative information on vessel diameter is obtained . To assess retinal vessel diameters , fundus camera-based tech-niques using photography and concomitant image analysis are used . Several studies used the commercially available dynamic vessel analyzer DVA , a device that consists of a video fundus camera , a real-time monitor , and a personal computer . This system allows precise real-time recordings of retinal arterial and venous diameter based on the brightness profile of the recorded images . Diameters are analyzed with a maximum frequency of 50 Hz , which means that a maximum of 25 vessel diameter readings can be obtained per second Blum et al. , 1999 Garhofer et al. , 2009 Polak et al. , 2000b . Blood flow velocities in retinal branch arteries and veins can be measured by laser Doppler velocimetry LDV . This technique is based on the optical Doppler effect by registering the frequency shift from laser light scattered by moving particles erythrocytes . The frequency shift in the backscattered light is proportional to the blood flow velocity in the retinal vessel . Using bi-directional LDV the absolute velocity in the retinal vessels can be obtained Riva et al. , 1983 . By combining LDV with vessel diameter measure-ments the volumetric flow rate in the major retinal vessels can be determined Riva et al. , 1985 . In contrast , laser Doppler flowmetry LDF , a technique also based on the optical Doppler effect , the laser beam is not directed towards a retinal vessel , but on vascularized tissue with no large visible vessels . With this device , mean red blood cell velocity , blood volume and blood flow can be obtained in relative units Riva , 2001 Riva et al. , 2009 . The technique can be used to measure subfoveal choroidal blood flow Riva et al. , 1994 , but also to measure ONH blood flow Riva et al. , 1992 . Whereas this technique is well suitable to measure relative changes in blood flow during provocation , comparison of data between different patient groups is difficult , because absolute LDF values do not only depend on blood flow within the scattering volume , but also on the scattering properties of tissue Riva et al. , 2009 . The speckle phenomenon that occurs when laser light is back-scattered from an uneven surface , in this case the ocular fundus , is used for the laser speckle technique . The normalized blur NB , a factor related to the reciprocal of the speckle contrast , or the square blur ratio can be used for the quantitative assessment of blood velocities in retinal , choroidal and ONH vasculature Briers and Fercher , 1982 Sugiyama et al. , 2009 Tamaki et al. , 1995 . A non-invasive method to measure white blood cell movement is the blue field entoptic technique Riva and Petrig , 1980 . It is based on the so-called entoptic phenomenon that appears when looking into a blue light with a narrow optical spectrum at a wavelength of approximately 430 nm . Passing white blood cells in contrast to red blood cells do not absorb short wavelength light . The subject under study notices this as many tiny corpuscles and by comparing and adjusting the number and the mean velocity of the particles with a simulated particle field , an estimate of perimacular white blood cell flux can be obtained . A limitation of this method is its subjective nature and that it needs sufficient cooperation of the subject Luksch et al. , 2009 . Other techniques focus on the pulsatile component of ocular blood flow . Two different approaches have been proposed . IOP changes during the cardiac cycle can be measured with a pneu-motonometric device . The maximum IOP change during the cardiac cycle is called pulse amplitude PA . From the time course of the IOP change over the cardiac cycle , pulsatile ocular blood flow POBF can be calculated based on the ocular pressureevolume relation-ship Langham et al. , 1989 Silver et al. , 1989 . The other method measures distance changes between cornea and retina during the cardiac cycle , a phenomenon called ocular fundus pulsation . For this purpose the eye is illuminated with light from a parallel laser beam and the interferences between the reflections from the front side of the cornea and the retina are recorded . The maximum distance change during the cardiac cycle is called fundus pulsation amplitude FPA and correlates well with PA and POBF Schmetterer et al. , 1998 , , 2000a . Optical Doppler tomography combines the principles of laser Doppler and optical coherence tomography OCT . Time-domain and frequency-domain approaches have been realized to measure velocity profiles in larger retinal arteries and veins Leitgeb et al. , 2003 , , 2004 Yazdanfar et al. , 2003 . Several techniques have been proposed to measure absolute retinal blood velocities including tracing of retinal vessels Wang et al. , 2008b and bi-directional Doppler OCT Werkmeisteret al. , 2008 . By using three-dimensional flow imaging with high-speed spectral domain-OCT , the three-dimensional vasculature of the posterior part of the human eye can be visualized Makita et al. , 2006 . Angiographic techniques use fluorescent dye to gain informa-tion about blood flow . Retinal blood velocity is assessed by the time required for the dye to pass through retinal circulation , defined as the mean retinal circulation time difference between venous and arterial times Rechtman et al. , 2003 . Other approaches employ videoangiography Wolf et al. , 1989 and scanning laser ophthalmoscopy Harris et al. , 2008 . These methods assess the arteriovenous passage time , defined as the time between the first appearance of the dye in a retinal artery and in the corresponding vein . To assess autoregulation one needs to modify OPP . This can be done experimentally by changing arterial blood pressure or IOP . An increase in systemic blood pressure leads to an increase in OPP , while an increase in IOP leads to a decrease in OPP . A widely used method to increase OPP is isometric exercise . Subjects are asked to perform exercise while ocular blood flow measurement is per-formed at given time points or continuously . Squatting in a position where the upper and the lower leg are as close to a right angle as possible , without leaning against a wall or support has been proven to be an efficient method to increase systemic blood pressure Kiss et al. , 2001 Risner et al. , 2009 . Handgripping is another form of isometric exercise . The indi-vidual maximum voluntary contraction can be determined by using a handgrip dynamometer Sisto and Dyson-Hudson , 2007 . The subject under study rests his or her forearm on a table with the elbow at an angle of 90 during muscular contraction . This method also leads to a significant increase in systemic blood pressure , although the increase is usually less pronounced than during squatting Schmetterer et al. , 1998 . Handgripping can , however , be more easily done in elderly patients with ocular pathology . Systemic blood pressure also increases when subjects perform dynamic exercise . Different modes of dynamic exercise have been used , for example stair climbing or treadmill exercise Risner et al. , 2009 . However , dynamic exercise normally does not allow for the subject under study to focus , which is required for ocular perfusion measurements . An exception is bicycling , which has been employed to gain insight into ocular autoregulation Lovasik et al. , 2003 . Another method to induce acute changes in perfusion pressure is through changes in posture . By moving from the supine to the standing position , blood pressure at the level of the head drops by 20e30 mmHg which also leads to a decrease in cerebrovascular resistance . This autoregulatory control seems to be mediated by a combination of metabolic and myogenic mechanisms Addition-ally , the autonomic nervous system is involved in this regulation process . In particular , sudden drops in blood pressure lead to the activation of the baroreflex , which affects regions that are sympa-thetically innervated Hague and Hill , 1988 Olufsen et al. , 2002 , , 2005 . Moving from the sitting to the supine position leads to an increase in IOP Kiuchi et al. , 2009 . An advantage of this method is that changes in OPP and blood flow autoregulation can be studied in patients and elderly subjects , while application of the previously described methods is difficult in these populations . An experimental increase in IOP and therefore a decrease in OPP can be induced by the suction cup method . This method has been described by Ulrich and Ulrich 1985 . Briefly , the device consists of an automatic suction pump that is connected by plastic tubing to a rigid plastic suction cup . After topically applied anesthesia , the standardized 11-mm diametersuction cup is placed on the temporal sclera with the anterior edge at least 1 mm from the limbus . The vacuum can then be incrementally increased to produce elevated IOP levels Riva et al. , 1986 Stodtmeister et al. , 1989 . After the release of the suction cup a transient reduction in IOP is seen , which can be used to study ocular blood flow during an increase in OPP Grunwald et al. , 1982 . Sudden changes in arterial blood pressure can be induced by the thigh cuff technique . This technique applies two thigh cuffs which are wrapped around both thighs and are inflated to approximately 20 mmHg above peak systolic blood pressure . By rapid deflation of the bilateral thigh cuff , a decline in arterial blood pressure can be induced Aaslid et al. , 1989 Kolodjaschna et al. , 2005 . Systemic blood pressure can also be modified pharmacologi-cally . However , one has to consider that such drugs also potentially have direct vasomotor effects on the ocular vasculature . Tyramine , an indirect sympathomimetic agent , has been reported to be an effective drug to study autoregulation in the retina Davies et al. , 1991 . It releases endogenous noradrenaline from sympathetic nerve terminals leading to peripheral vasoconstriction and there-fore to an increase in systemic blood pressure Garhofer et al. , 2003 . Since the retina lacks sympathetic innervation , local noradrenaline release in the retina can not be triggered Laties , 1967 Malmfors , 1965 . Tyramine is metabolized mainly in the heart and the lungs , therefore a direct effect of the drug on retinal vessels can almost be excluded Jandrasits et al. , 2002 . 3.2 . Animal models Obviously , studying autoregulatory processes in animal models offers some advantages , because manipulation of perfusion pres-sure is easier . For example , IOP can be changed by inserting a cannula in the vitreous that is connected to a syringe filled with saline Kiel and van Heuven , 1995 Liang et al. , 2009a Shonat et al. , 1992 . In addition there are several methods available to measure ocular blood flow which can not be applied in humans due to their invasive nature . Regional blood flow can be measured by the use of intravascular microspheres . For this purpose , labeled microspheres get surgically administered into the left heart and are then distributed with the blood in all tissues , where they get trapped . From the proportion of microspheres found in the tissue under investigation to the amount found in a reference blood sample taken during microsphere injection , regional blood flow can be calculated . Choosing the right size of microspheres for the used animal model and the tissue under study is very important , since too large particles can cause hemodynamic problems , while too small particles may pass through a capillary bed without being trapped Alm and Bill , 1973 Heymann et al. , 1977 Wang et al. , 2007 . Microspheres can be labeled radioactively , but it is also possible to use colored or fluo-rescent microspheres . The heated thermocouple principle can be used to measure relative blood flow in uveal veins . For this purpose , a small piece of constantan wire is attached to the exposed sclera which is inter-mittently heated with a constant current . A thermocouple then measures the temperature of the wire . The longer the time it takes to heat the wire , the greater is the uveal blood flow . This method has been applied in rabbits , cats and monkeys Armaly and Araki , 1975 Bill , 1962a , b . Blood flow in single vessels can be assessed by the ultrasonic flowmeter , a device that consists of two ultrasonic transducers and a fixed acoustic reflector . The vessel under investigation has to be surgically exposed and is then placed under the window of the device . The transducer emits ultrasound waves , which intersect the blood vessel by travelling to and from the acoustic reflector . The transit time of the ultrasound wavefrom one transducer tothe other is analyzed by the flowmeter . Repeating this cycle in the upstream and downstream directions leads to differences in transit times which are the measurement of volume flow . Ultrasonic flowmetry has been performed in the long posterior ciliary artery of the cat because the anatomy and the perfusion region of this vessel are more similar to those of humans than in other nonprimate experi-mental animals Koss , 1999 , 2001 . Under anesthesia , LDF and laser speckle flowgraphy can also be applied in animals Briers , 2001 Kiel et al. , 2001 Koss , 1999 , 2001 Liang et al. , 2009b . The choroidal blood flow in rabbits , rats and cats have been measured by LDF . In contrast to humans , this is invasive since the probe tip needs to be positioned in the vitreous or posterior to the limbus Kiel , 1999 Koss , 2000 , 2001 . The same non-invasive LDF device that is used in human studies has been used to measure ocular blood flow in monkeys and cats Buerk and Riva , 1998 Petrig et al. , 1999 Riva et al. , 1992 . However , the eyes of the animals then have to be immobilized . Non-invasive laser speckle flowgraphy has been shown to be sufficient to measure ONH circulation in rabbits and monkeys Hirao et al. , 2004 Liang et al. , 2009a , , 2009b . To study autoregulation , OPP in animals can be manipulated . In rabbits , an increase or decrease in MAP is possible through place-ment of hydraulic occluders around the thoracic descending aorta and the inferior vena cava . Closing the aortic occluder redirects the cardiac output to the upper body and therefore increases MAP at the eye , while closing the caval occluder reduces venous return to the heart and therefore decreases blood pressure at the eye Kiel and Shepherd , 1992 . To which degree data from animal studies can be applied to the human vasculature is unclear . On the one hand , the pronounced differences between the vascular supplies of different species need to be considered Cioffi et al. , 2003 Funk , 1993 Ninomiya and Kuno , 2001 Ninomiya et al. , 2008 Provis , 2001 . On the other hand the anesthetic procedures applied may have a significant impact on the autoregulatory behavior of the ocular vasculature Roth , 1992 Roth et al. , 1993 . 4 . Autoregulatory processes in the eye 4.1 . Principles of autoregulation Autoregulation is the ability of a vascular bed to adapt its vascular resistance to changes in perfusion pressure so that blood flow remains relatively constant . This is necessary to stabilize tissue perfusion and capillary hydrostatic pressure during normal varia-tions in blood pressure . Typical pressure-flow characteristics of an autoregulated vascular bed and a non-autoregulated vascular bed are shown in Fig. 1 . In the non-autoregulated vascular bed any change in perfusion pressure translates into a change in perfusion . In an autoregulated vascular bed this is not the case as long as the perfusion pressure is changed within the autoregulatory plateau . At any given perfusion pressure within this plateau there is an autoregulatory reserve . The autoregulatory reserve is determined by the lower and the upper limits of autoregulation . Changing perfusion pressure within the autoregulatory plateau does not alter blood flow , but alters the lower and upper autoregulatory reserve . Given that autoregulation is a complex phenomenon , only some aspects can be investigated in vivo . When using the term autor-egulation , one has to differentiate between static and dynamic autoregulation . The concept of static autoregulation assumes that mean ocular blood flow remains constant for changes in arterial blood pressure or OPP Fig. 2 . The variables are measured and averaged for 30 s or longer . By investigating static ocular autor-egulation , most investigators induce changes in IOP to determine whether or not a group of subjects is showing autoregulation . Static autoregulation can either be assessed in each subject studied , as described above , or data of a specific group of subjects can be pooled Findl et al. , 2000 Fuchsjager-Mayrl et al. , 2004 Fuchsjager-Mayrl et al. , 2009 Panerai , 1998 . In general , the former design is preferred , however , pooling data can be useful when only one measurement is possible or in patients where it is critical to not provoke changes in OPP . In contrast , the concept of dynamic autoregulation is based on the finding that because of sudden changes in arterial blood A pressure ocular blood flow gets disturbed , but normally returns to its baseline values fast Panerai , 2008 . To study dynamic ocular autoregulation , it is necessary to introduce a step disturbance in OPP and to record the responses of ocular blood flow continuously before and after this step disturbance Kolodjaschna et al. , 2005 . 4.2 . Autoregulation in the retina In contrast to the extraocular and choroidal vessels , retinal vessels have no neural innervation . Therefore , local vascular mechanisms are mainly responsible for matching perfusion to the changes in metabolic demand Riva and Schmetterer , 2008 . It has been demonstrated that the retina shows autoregulatory capacity in response to a wide range of changes in perfusion pressure . Retinal arterioles react to an experimental increase of OPP through exercise with vasoconstriction Jeppesen et al. , 2007a Kergoat and Lovaski , 1995 . This vasoconstriction is necessary to maintain constant retinal blood flow RBF during the increase in perfusion pressure Dumskyj et al. , 1996 Harris et al. , 1996b Iester et al. , 2007 Robinson et al. , 1986 . Given that the retinal vessels show no innervation at the site of measurement a sympathetically driven vasoconstriction can be excluded and local factors seem to mediate this vasoconstriction . The mediators of this vasoconstrictor response are , however , largely unknown . Administration of an endothelinA receptor antagonist blunts the vasoconstrictor response of retinal branch arteries indicating an involvement of the endothelin system Luksch et al. , 2006 . The source of endothelin during this stimulus is , however , not clear and is unlikely from extraocular sources given that endothelin is primarily a para-crine mediator . By contrast angiotensin-receptors Luksch et al. , 2006 , b-receptors and muscarinic receptors do not play a major role in this response Jandrasits et al. , 2001 . Whereas the vaso-constrictor response of retinal branch arteries can be quantified using fundus photography or the DVA , the behavior of smaller vessels is less clear , since their diameter can not be visualized because of the limited resolution of the currently available tech-nology . Only indirect evidence can be obtained by measuring blood velocity in branch veins and branch arteries . Taken together , most studies indicate that retinal autoregulation breaks down when MAP rises to approximately 40 % over baseline Dumskyj et al. , 1996 Robinson et al. , 1986 . Given that branch arteries constrict imme-diately after an increase in blood pressure that would mean that blood velocity slightly increases at any increment in perfusion pressure . Indeed there is evidence from previously published data that this is the case Dumskyj et al. , 1996 Robinson et al. , 1986 , but the high variability of bi-directional LDV makes it difficult to quantify this effect Luksch et al. , 2009 . However , this increase in blood velocity does not mean that the small resistance arteries dilate . Obviously , it is the other way round as evidenced by the increase in vascular resistance , which can easily be calculated since vascular resistance is calculated as OPP RBF . During moderate isometric exercise OPP increases whereas RBF stays constant resulting in an increase of vascular resistance due to vasocon-striction of small resistance vessels of arterioles between 20 and 50 mm , which play the major role in regulating vascular resistance . As such RBF stays constant in face of an increase in perfusion pressure , but the hemodynamic situation has changed with constricted arterioles and increased blood velocities . A decrease of OPP by use of the suction cup method leads to an increase in retinal arteriolar diameter as part of the autoregulatory process . Interestingly , however , retinal vein diameters decrease when IOP is increased Nagel and Vilser , 2004 . The dilatation of the arteries is probably due to myogenic autoregulation since an increase in IOP leads to decreased transmural pressure in retinal arterioles . This is necessary to keep RBF constant during the decrease in OPP . The vasoconstriction occurring in retinal veins may be caused by the weaker wall construction and the lower intravascular pressure in the venous system thereby representing a passive effect . Nagel and Vilser , 2004 Again , RBF is autoregulated to a certain degree when OPP is decreased . RBF autoregulation seems to break down when IOP rises over approximately 30 mmHg Riva et al. , 1986 Schulte et al. , 1996 . However , until reaching this IOP level , RBF remains almost constant Weigert et al. , 2005 . This is now achieved by vasodilatation in retinal branch arteries associated with reduced blood velocities . One type of autoregulation , so-called metabolic autoregulation , is defined as the ability of an organ to regulate its blood flow in accordance with its metabolic needs Pournaras et al. , 2008 . Studies conducted in cats have shown that retinal tissue oxygen partial pressure pO2 remains constant during a moderate decrease in OPP Alm and Bill , 1972a Neely et al. , 1995 Yancey and Linsenmeier , 1989 . This is also reflected in findings in humans , since hypoxia and or hypercapnia lead to vasodilatation in retinal vessels while vessels respond to hyperoxia with vasoconstriction Fallon et al. , 1985 Pournaras et al. , 2008 Resch et al. , 2005 . Hyperoxia further leads to a pronounced reduction in RBF thereby keeping tissue pO2 constant Kiss et al. , 2002 . 4.3 . Autoregulation in the optic nerve head Most authors report that the vascular bed in the ONH features autoregulatory capacity over a wide range of perfusion pressures , although only few studies have been performed . Movaffaghy et al. 1998 conducted a study in healthy volunteers where they induced changes in OPP by letting the subjects perform isometric exercise . ONH blood flow was measured using LDF . Blood flow in the ONH did not change until OPP increased about 34 % over baseline Movaffaghy et al. , 1998 . Several animal studies employing different methods for the assessment of perfusion have shown that ONH blood flow is autoregulated during a decrease in OPP Geijer and Bill , 1979 Riva et al. , 1996 Sossi and Anderson , 1983 . This also seems to be true in humans , where IOP was raised using the suction cup method in healthy subjects . The vasculature of the ONH showed autoregulatory capacity up to an increase of IOP to approximately 40e45 mmHg as shown by two studies using LDF Pillunat et al. , 1997 Riva et al. , 1997a . Interestingly , however , it seems that the ONH vasculature is not fully dilated at this point . This is evidenced by the observation that diffuse luminance flicker increases ONH blood flow evenwhen IOPis increased to a level where autoregulation does not function anymore Garhofer et al. , 2005 . 4.4 . Autoregulation in the choroid Data regarding choroidal autoregulation are contradictory . While previous animal studies suggest that the choroid is a strictly passive vascular bed Alm and Bill , 1972b , 1973 , more recent animal data indicate some degrees of choroidal autoregulation Kiel and Shepherd , 1992 . A series of rabbit experiments found choroidal autoregulation in response to an increase as well as to a decrease in OPP Kiel and Shepherd , 1992 Kiel and van Heuven , 1995 . In humans regulatory phenomena to both , an experi-mental increase and decrease in OPP in the choroid have been confirmed Polska et al. , 2007 . One must , however , not interpret this as autoregulation in its strict sense , because of the rich neural input into the human choroid . Choroidal blood flow autoregulation seems to be equally effective during dynamic and isometric exer-cise Lovasik et al. , 2003 . If perfusion pressure is elevated higher than approximately 60 % over baseline , choroidal autoregulation seems to fail during isometric exercise Kiss et al. , 2001 Riva et al. , 1997b . One must , however , consider that isometric exercise may alter sympathetic input into the choroid . Hence , increasing OPP by other means may well elicit a different choroidal blood flow response . On the other hand , it appears that choroidal blood flow is less well regulated when IOP is increased inducing a decrease in OPP Polska et al. , 2007 . Nevertheless the decrease in OPP when IOP is increased is more pronounced than the reduction in choroidal blood flow indicating for some degree of regulation and peripheral vasodilatation . 5 . Mechanisms of autoregulation 5.1 . Neuronal mechanisms There is evidence that a neural component plays a key role in choroidal regulatory mechanisms . In contrast to retinal vessels , choroidal vessels show rich innervations Cioffi et al. , 2003 . Sympathetic nerves in the choroid derive from the ipsilateral superior cervical ganglion Lutjen-Drecoll , 2006 . Sympathetic stimulation reduces choroidal blood flow in a variety of species Riva and Schmetterer , 2008 Steinle et al. , 2000 , and sympathetic denervation leads to an increase in choroidal blood flow in rats and rabbits Chou et al. , 2000,2002 Steinle et al. , 2002 . Accordingly , adrenoceptor agonists reduce choroidal blood flow in the cat and rat mediated via vasoconstrictor a-receptors Kawarai and Koss , 1998 Koss , 1994 . This is in good agreement with data in rabbits , where a-adrenoceptor blockade by phentolamine caused choroidal vasodilatation Kiel and Lovell , 1996 . Topical administration of either clonidine or brimonidine , a2-receptor agonists , decreases choroidal blood flow in healthy subjects . In addition , the choroidal blood flowepressure relationship during squatting is significantly altered by administration of these two agents Weigert et al. , 2007 . The role of b-receptors in choroidal blood flow regulation remains , however , unclear . In some species , sympathetic vasodilatation after a-receptor blockade seems to be mediated via b-receptors Busch et al. , 1991 Kawarai and Koss , 1999 . Propranolol , a nonse-lective b-adrenoceptor antagonist , caused choroidal vasoconstric-tion in the rabbit Kiel and Lovell , 1996 . In humans , however , propranolol did not alter the choroidal blood flowepressure rela-tionship under basal conditions or during isometric exercise Polska et al. , 2003b . The same phenomenon was observed in rabbits after topical application of timolol and betaloxol Kiel and Patel , 1998 . There is evidence that parasympathetic stimulation increases choroidal blood flow . Parasympathetic nerve fibers in the eye derive from the pterygopalatine ganglion via the facial nerve Lutjen-Drecoll , 2006 . Intracranial stimulation of the facial nerve causes a significant vasodilatation in the choroid Cioffi et al. , 2003 . This has been shown in rats , rabbits , cats and monkeys Nilsson et al. , 1985 Steinle et al. , 2000 Stjernschantz and Bill , 1980 . In pigeons stimulation of the Edinger-Westphal nucleus increased choroidal blood flow Fitzgerald et al. , 1990 . This effect was attenuated by both , topical and intravenous administration of atropine , a muscarinic receptor antagonist Zagvazdin et al. , 2000 . In mammals , however , parasympathetic vasodilatation in choroidal vessels does not seem to be mediated via muscarinic receptors . In the rabbit , administration of atropine , did not alter the choroidal pressureeflow relationship and also had no effect on baseline values for choroidal flux Kiel , 1999 . This is in keeping with a study conducted in healthy volunteers , where atropine did not induce changes in choroidal blood flow neither under basal conditions nor during isometric exercise Polska et al. , 2003b . However , this does not exclude the presence of parasympathetic nerves in the choroid since nicotinic receptors could be involved . In rabbits , hexame-thonium , a nicotinic receptor antagonist , reduced choroidal blood flow and induced a small rightward shift in the pressureeflow relationship Kiel , 1999 . Data in healthy subjects indicate that the choroid regulates its blood flow better during exercise-induced changes in MAP than during an experimental increase in IOP Polska et al. , 2007 . It has previously been shown that the sympathetic nervous system plays a role in protecting the choroid against overperfusion during an increase in blood pressure Bill and Linder , 1976 . This is well compatible with the results of several studies showing regulation of choroidal blood flow in response to exercise , which stimulates the sympathetic system and in turn leads to vasoconstriction and constant blood flow in face of the OPP increase . Most likely vaso-constrictive a1-receptors are involved in this process , because several animal experiments indicate a key role of this receptor subtype in the vasoconstrictor response in face of an increase in OPP Kawarai and Koss , 1998 Steinle et al. , 2000 . During an elevation in IOP with the suction cup , it seems justified to assume that stimulation of the sympathetic and parasympathetic system is less pronounced . In addition , it remains unclear whether choroidal veins are sympathetically innervated . Since an increase in IOP does , however , mainly change the transmural pressure in the venous side of the choroidal vascular system , a counterregulatory response via the sympathetic system may not occur . This holds of course only true , if choroidal veins lack of sympathetic innervation . 5.2 . Metabolic mechanisms According to the metabolic theory of autoregulation , blood flow is regulated to meet the metabolic needs of a specific tissue . Accordingly , blood gases such as O2 and carbon dioxide CO2 have significant effects on ocular blood flow . Hyperoxia and hypoxia cause a decrease and increase in retinal and ONH blood flow , respectively Chung et al. , 1999 Fallon et al. , 1985 Gilmore et al. , 2005 Harris et al. , 1996a Kiss et al. , 2002 Langhans et al. , 1997 Luksch et al. , 2002 Riva et al. , 1983 Sponsel et al. , 1992 Strenn et al. , 1997 Wimpissinger et al. , 2005 . By contrast , changes in blood oxygenation have little impact on the choroidal circulation Geiser et al. , 2000 Kergoat et al. , 2005 Schmetterer et al. , 1995 , , 2000b . CO2 , however , is a potent vasodilator in all vascular beds at the posterior pole of the eye Dorner et al. , 2002 Harino et al. , 1995 Kergoat and Faucher , 1999 Schmetterer et al. , 1996,1997a Venkataraman et al. , 2008 Wang et al. , 2008a Wimpissinger et al. , 2004 . In healthy subjects , inhalation of carbon monoxide CO increases retinal and choroidal blood flow , but the exact role of CO in the regulation of ocular blood flow remains unknown Resch et al. , 2005 . Nitric oxide NO is an important vasodilator in the eye , as it is in other vascular beds . NO is produced from L-arginine , a reaction which is catalyzed by NO-synthase NOS . To date , three isoforms of NOS have been identified Neural nitric oxide synthase nNOS , endothelial nitric oxide synthase eNOS and inducible nitric oxide synthase iNOS . While iNOS is only present under pathological conditions in response to allergic or inflammatory processes , eNOS and nNOS are constitutively expressed . NO then stimulates guanylyl cyclase which synthesizes cyclic guanosine monophosphate . This leads to an effluxof calcium outof the cell and therefore to relaxation of the smooth muscle cell . NO synthesis can be inhibited by several L-arginine analogues such as NG-monomethyl-L-arginine L-NMMA , NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester L-NAME and NG-nitro-L-arginine L-NA . These substances are competitive inhibitors of NOS and their effects can be reversed by excess doses of L-arginine . However , none of these L-arginine analogues are specific for any of the three isoforms of NOS Schmetterer and Polak , 2001 . Several studies have shown that NO is involved in regulation of ocular blood flow . Blockade of NOS leads to a decrease in retinal and choroidal blood flow under resting conditions in a variety of species Deussen et al. , 1993 Harino et al. , 1999 Koss , 1998 Mann et al. , 1995 Seligsohn and Bill , 1993 . In humans , intravenous administration of L-NMMA also reduced choroidal and ONH blood flow and significantly reduced the diameter of retinal vessels Dorner et al. , 2003 Luksch et al. , 2000 Schmetterer et al. , 1997c . Constant release of NO therefore contributes to basal vascular tone in the eye as it does in other vascular beds Schmetterer and Polak , 2001 . Several studies investigated the role of NO in ocular blood flow autoregulation . NO altered choroidal , retinal and ONH autor-egulation during an experimental increase in IOP in rabbits and newborn piglets Jacot et al. , 1998 Okuno et al. , 2002 . In an extensive study investigating the effect of NO on choroidal autor-egulation in rabbits , systemic blood pressure was mechanically altered to induce changes in OPP . Administrationof L-NAME reduced choroidal blood flow over the entire perfusion pressure range compared to control . A pronounced rightward shift of the pressur-eeflow relationship was observed Kiel , 1999 . In a study conducted in healthy volunteers , subjects either received L-NMMA , the a-adrenoceptor agonist phenylephrine or placebo . Phenylephrine did not alter the choroidal pressureeflow relationship versus placebo or versus baseline . Inhibition of NO-synthase , however , significantly altered the pressureeflow relationship during isometric exercise Luksch et al. , 2003 . Another study in healthy volunteers tested the hypothesis that NO also plays a role in choroidal blood flow regu-lation during a decrease in OPP . In a randomized , double-masked , placebo-controlled , three-way cross-over trial the effects of L-NMMA , phenylephrine and placebo on choroidal blood flow regu-lation was tested . Although L-NMMA decreased basal choroidal blood flow , it did not alter choroidal blood flow regulation during an artificial increase in IOP Simader et al. , 2009 . NO also seems to play a role in hypercapnia-induced vasodila-tation . In humans , NOS inhibition attenuated hypercapnia-induced vasodilatation in the choroid and the middle cerebral artery Schmetterer et al. , 1997a . Another vasodilator that is probably involved in the control of ocular blood flow is adenosine . Its vasodilator effect is primarily mediated by adenosine A1 and A2 receptors . Activation of these receptors increases adenylyl cyclase activity and the subsequent increased cyclic adenosine 3,50-monophosphate cAMP levels relax vascular smooth muscle Polska et al. , 2003a . Intravitreal injection of adenosine caused an increase in retinal vessel diameter , as well as in retinal and choroidal blood flow Braunagel et al. , 1988 Campochiaro and Sen , 1989 . Intravenous administration of aden-osine in cats increased choroidal blood flow , but did not alter retinal or ONH blood flow Portellos et al. , 1995 . In humans , intravenous administration of adenosine increased choroidal and ONH blood flow Polska et al. , 2003a . A study conducted in piglets suggested that adenosine may play a role in RBF autoregulation during hypoxia and hypotension Gidday and Park , 1993 . The role of adenosine in retinal , ONH and choroidal blood flow changes during manipulation in OPP in humans is unknown . Endothelin-1 ET-1 is a potent vasoconstrictor Abraham and Dashwood , 2008 . It is produced predominantly by the vascular endothelium . ET-1 preferably binds to the ETA-receptor located on vascular smooth muscle cells that mediate vasoconstriction and to the ETB1 receptor located on endothelial cells that mediate vaso-dilatation through the release of NO and prostacyclin Rubanyi and Polokoff , 1994 . Intravitreal administration of ET-1 significantly decreased RBF in the cat . However , blood flow in the choroid remained unaffected Granstam et al. , 1992 . In the rabbit choroid both , ETA and ETB receptors seem to be present . Administration of ET-1 and blockade of the ETB receptor during an experimental increase in MAP caused a downward shift in the pressureeflow relationship indicating a vasoconstrictor response of the choroid . In contrast , ETA-receptor blockade did not alter the pressureeflow relationship Kiel , 2000 . In rabbits intravitreal injection of ET-1 also caused a significant decrease in retinal artery diameter and in ONH blood flow Sasaoka et al. , 2006 . In healthy male subjects , intravenous administration of ET-1 reduced pulsatile blood flow in the choroid and optic disc at doses that did not affect systemic blood pressure Schmetterer et al. , 1997b . In another study where choroidal and ONH blood flow in response to exogenous ET-1 administration was investigated , similar results showing a reduc-tion in blood flow were found . BQ-123 , an ETA-receptor antagonist , completely reversed this reaction . Like in the rabbit , ETA-receptor blockade did not alter choroidal or ONH blood flow but increased mean blood velocity in the ophthalmic artery Polak et al. , 2001 . In the retina , ET-1 administration caused a significant reduction in blood flow . This effect was also completely reversed by adminis-tration of BQ-123 . ETA-receptor blockade alone did not alter RBF Polak et al. , 2003 . This indicates that ET-1 plays an important role in human ocular circulation and that its vasoconstrictor effect is mainly mediated via the ETA-receptor . Interestingly , dual endo-thelin receptor blockade by Bosentan over a period of 14 days significantly increased retinal , choroidal and ONH blood flow in both , healthy subjects and glaucoma patients Resch et al. , 2009b . ET-1 also seems to be involved in the autoregulatory response to anincrease in OPP . AdministrationofBQ-123significantlyaltered the vasoconstrictor response of choroidal and RBF during an experi-mental increase ofOPPbyisometric exercise Fuchsjager-Mayrl et al. , 2003 Luksch et al. , 2006 . BQ-123 also reduced the hyperoxia-induced vasoconstrictor response of retinal vessels . ET-1 therefore also seems to contribute to this process Dallinger et al. , 2000 . 5.3 . Myogenic mechanisms The myogenic response has been first described by Bayliss in 1902 Bayliss , 1902 . This response , also called Bayliss effect , is character-ized by a decrease in vessel diameter after an increase in transmural pressure Schubert and Mulvany , 1999 . Myogenic response is a function of the smooth muscle to contract in response to a stretching force and to relax in response to a decrease in transmural pressure Just , 2007 Schubert and Mulvany , 1999 . Briefly , stretching of the vessel wall leads to depolarization of the cell membrane of smooth muscle cells . Activation of voltage-gated calcium Ca2 ? channels leads to influx of Ca2 ? and to vasoconstriction Davis and Hill , 1999 . The primary function of myogenic autoregulation is to maintain the Starling equilibrium for capillary fluid exchange to prevent arterial-pressure-dependent fluctuations in capillary blood volume and hydrostatic pressure . It is unclear whether myogenic autoregulation performs a similar function in the eye . Most ocular blood volume in the eye is in the choroid . It is therefore possible that choroidal vessels stabilize the IOP during variations in systemic arterial pressure through myogenic autoregulation Kiel , 1994 . In a study conducted in rabbits , Kiel and Shepherd observed that choroidal autoregulation was present in response to changes in MAP while IOP was maintained stable at 5 mmHg , 15 mmHg and 25 mmHg . The pressureeflow relationship became more linear i.e. the choroid showed less autoregulatory capacity during changes in MAP the higher the IOP was held . When MAP was held stable at approximately 80 mmHg and IOP was manipulated choroidal blood flow was OPP independent until IOP was raised above 25 mmHg Kiel and Shepherd , 1992 . In a later study , where changes in MAP were induced without controlling IOP , an even more pronounced autor-egulation in the rabbits� choroid was found . During an experimental increase in MAP , IOP initially increased , but returned to baseline despite the continued elevation of MAP . This could be due to avascular mechanism controlling choroidal blood volume to stabilize IOP during MAP fluctuations Kiel , 1994 . Myogenic autoregulation seems to be present in all parts in the vascular system but the magnitude of the response to changes in perfusion pressure seems to depend on the vessel diameter Davis , 1993 . This also seems to be true for myogenic regulation in the eye . In isolated rat ophthalmic arteries , arterial diameter remained stable during an increase in MAP ranging from approximately 40 mmHge210 mmHg . Pressures higher than that resulted in forced vasodilatation with a complete loss of myogenic tone at 240 mmHg Ito et al. , 2007 Jarajapu et al. , 2004 . Isolated bovine retinal arteries responded to an increase in intraluminal pressure with a decrease in diameter . This adaptation was most pronounced in the pressure range from 10 mmHg to 60 mmHg Delaey and Van de Voorde , 2000 . In isolated porcine retinal arterioles , a similar vasoconstrictive response to an increase in intraluminal pressure was observed Jeppesen et al. , 2003 . In humans , it is unclear if myogenic mechanisms are involved in the autoregulation of choroidal blood flow . Like in the rabbit , the human choroid also seems to regulate its blood flow better during changes in MAP than during an experimental increase in IOP Polska et al. , 2007 . Whether this represents a myogenic mecha-nism is unclear , but the results are at least compatible with a myogenic hypothesis . An artificial increase in IOP is associated with a decrease in OPP , but also with a decrease in the transmural pressure gradient . Choroidal blood flow may therefore decrease during an increase in IOP , because the decrease in OPP is paralleled by a decrease in perfusion pressure gradient . The situation is different when the OPP is increased by increasing blood pressure , because the full myogenic response is initiated by the increase in transmural pressure in the arterial system . This will in turn induce vasoconstriction and accordingly a counterregulatory response to keep blood flow constant Fig. 2a . An increase in MAP by isometric exercise causes a significant vasoconstriction of retinal arterioles in healthy subjects Blum et al. , 1999 Jeppesen et al. , 2007b . Whether this truly indicates the presence of myogenic autoregulation in these vessels as suggested previously is , however , unclear Blum et al. , 1999 . 5.4 . Hormonal mechanisms There is evidence that circulating and locally produced hormones are involved in ocular blood flow regulation . The renin-angiotensin-system RAS may play a role in ocular blood flow regulation , since angiotensin-II receptor binding sides have been identified in ocular tissue Ferrari-Dileo et al. , 1987 , 1991 . Angio-tensin-II , a potent vasoconstrictor , has been shown to play an important regulatory role in porcine ophthalmic microcirculation Meyer et al. , 1995 . In humans , however , administration of angiotensin-II did not affect choroidal or ONH blood flow Krejcy et al. , 1997 . Administration of losartan , an angiotensin-receptor antagonist , also did not induce any changes in ocular blood flow Matulla et al. , 1997 . Enalapril , an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor did not alter retinal vessel response during isometric exercise Luksch et al. , 2006 . All these data indicate that the RAS does not play a major role in the regulation of ocular blood flow in healthy subjects . The vasodilator effect of insulin seems to be mediated by NO . Euglycemic hyperinsulinemia increased ocular blood flow in healthy subjects Polak et al. , 2000a . In another study this effect could be abolished by administration of L-NMMA Schmetterer et al. , 1997d . Co-infusion of L-arginine and insulin enhanced the vasodilator effect of L-arginine Dallinger et al. , 2003 . 6 . Vascular dysregulation in glaucoma Glaucomatous optic neuropathy is the most common optic neuropathy . It is characterized by progressive loss of retinal ganglion cells including their axons and by tissue remodeling of the ONH . Various research groups have formulated and defended two principal theories for the pathogenesis of glaucomatous optic neuropathy -a mechanical and a vascular theory . The mechanical theory mainly focuses on the role of IOP in the disease process . Elevated IOP leads to elongation , stretching and collapse of the laminar beams . The axons get damaged either directly by elevated IOP , or indirectly by tissue deformation . This also disturbs the axoplasmatic transport , which leads to cell death because of the lack of trophic factors . The vascular theory of glaucoma considers the glaucomatous optic neuropathy as a consequence of insuffi-cient , compromised blood supply and therefore reduced ocular blood flow due to either increased IOP or vascular dysregulation Flammer et al. , 2002 Resch et al. , 2009a . Glaucoma often comes with impaired blood flow autor-egulation . Most studies induced acute changes in OPP , to study autoregulatory behavior in glaucoma . One study in healthy subjects and glaucoma patients has shown that while healthy subjects respond to changes in posture from the sitting to the supine posi-tion with an in increase in resistivity index in the central retinal artery , no change in resistivity index in glaucoma patients can be observed Evans et al. , 1999 . Another study , where retinal vascular response to changes in posture were investigated found that open angle glaucoma patients showed a broader range of responses to changes in OPP than healthy controls , indicating disturbed autor-egulation in some of the patients Feke and Pasquale , 2008 . The reaction of retinal vessels to an experimental increase in IOP was more pronounced in healthy subjects compared to POAG patients or ocular hypertensives , indicative of abnormal autoregulation in the latter groups Nagel et al. , 2001 . Abnormal retinal autor-egulation in glaucoma patients to an increase in IOP has also been observed using the blue field entoptic technique . A hyperemic response after release of the suction cup device was observed in 16 of 17 normal eyes , 10 of 14 glaucoma suspect eyes but only in 9 of 19 glaucomatous eyes Grunwald et al. , 1984 . However , during a moderate increase in IOP in POAG patients and healthy controls , no difference in autoregulatory capacity of choroidal or ONH blood flow was found Weigert et al. , 2005 . Whereas these data clearly indicate that at least a subgroup of glaucoma patients show an abnormal response of blood flow to acute changes in OPP , only few data on the long-term adaptation to the actual level of blood pressure or IOP are available . The only way to get insight into this question is to look at group correlation data . In a group of glaucoma patients with adequately controlled IOPs patients without systemic hypertension had lower optic nerve blood flow than those with hypertension Grunwald et al. , 1999 . In progressive POAG patients a correlation between end-diastolic blood velocities and systemic blood pressure was found , which was absent in healthy controls and stable patients Gherghel et al. , 2000 Another study using fluorescein angiography showed that arteriovenous passage times were significantly correlated to OPP in patients with NTG , but not in healthy control subjects Plange et al. , 2008 . These results were confirmed in a larger study population consisting of POAG patients or patients with ocular hypertension . This group of untreated patients also showed an abnormal associ-ation between ONH blood flow measured with scanning LDF and systemic blood pressure compared to healthy controls Fuchsjager-Mayrl et al. , 2004 . The association between OPP and ONH blood flow in the same group of patients was again investigated after treatment with either dorzolamide or timolol . This was done as part of a randomized , double-masked , parallel-group clinical trial investigating the ocular hemodynamic effects of these drugs over a treatment period of 6 months . Although dorzolamide , but not timolol increased ONH blood flow Fuchsjager-Mayrl et al. , 2005 , both drugs normalized the association between ONH blood flow and OPP . This indicates that the mechanism underlying this effect is not related to the vasodilator action of the carbonic anhydrase inhibitor , but rather to the ocular hypotensive actions of the drug . Therefore normalization of IOP achieved by topical antiglaucoma medication may normalize the transmural pressure gradient as explained above and accordingly improve blood flow regulation . The reason why blood flow autoregulation in glaucoma is disturbed is to a large degree unknown , The NO system which is involved blood flow autoregulation as stated before , seems to be altered in glaucoma patients . Increased NO levels have been found in the aqueous humor and vitreous of glaucomatous dogs� eyes as well as in the aqueous humor of POAG patients Chang et al. , 2000 Kallberg et al. , 2007 . Some in-vitro studies report an over-expression of nNOS and eNOS in endothelial cells of glaucomatous optic nerve heads Neufeld et al. , 1997 . However , excessive expression of iNOS seems to be an issue in glaucomatous damage of retinal ganglion cells . In trabecular meshwork cells , increasing the perfusion of the anterior segment in donor eyes to model the effect of IOP resulted in increased levels of NO . This was accompanied by a significant increase in iNOS transcription level Schneemann et al. , 2003 . iNOS has been found in astrocytes of the ONH of human glaucomatous eyes and in rat eyes with chronic moderately elevated IOP Neufeld et al. , 1997 Shareef et al. , 1999 . In-vitro , expression of iNOS could be induced in ONH astrocytes by elevated pressure Liu and Neufeld , 2001 . This NO formation by iNOS seems to have potent neurotoxic properties Kaufman , 1999 Neufeld et al. , 1999 . Inhibition of iNOS formation by aminoguanidine in a rat model of glaucoma resulted in 10 % retinal ganglion cell loss while the non-treated group lost 36 % of their retinal ganglion cells . In a similar glaucoma model , administration of L-NAME also reduced retinal ganglion cell loss Park et al. , 2007 . In contrast , NO produced by eNOS seems to have neuro-protective effects by causing vasodilatation and increased blood flow in the tissue Neufeld et al. , 1997 Schmetterer and Polak , 2001 Systemic blockade of NOS by intravenous administration L-NMMA lead to a significantly less pronounced decrease in ONH blood flow in glaucoma patients compared to healthy controls , indicating decreased NO production via eNOS in glaucoma Polak et al. , 2007 . Whether this , however , is responsible for altered autoregulation in glaucoma remains uncertain . ET-1 levels have been found to be increased in the aqueous humor of glaucomatous eyes of dogs and humans Kallberg et al. , 2007 Noske et al. , 1997 Tezel et al. , 1997 . These increased ET-1 levels are accompanied with an upregulation of ETB receptors in the astrocytes of the ONH Wang et al. , 2006 . ET-1 seems to impair retrograde axonal transport in ONH through these ETB receptors Stokely et al. , 2002 Taniguchi et al. , 2006 . Vascular responses to these elevated ET-1 levels are probably ETA-receptor mediated resulting in vasoconstriction and ischemia Chauhan , 2008 . In animal models , chronic optic nerve ischemia can be induced by ET-1 resulting in deformation of the ONH , reduction of the number of ONH axons and in some species cupping of the ONH Chauhan et al. , 2004 Cioffi and Sullivan , 1999 Cioffi et al. , 2004 Cioffi , 2005 Lau et al. , 2006 Oku et al. , 1999 Orgul et al. , 1996 Sasaoka et al. , 2006 . Additionally , a reduction in optic nerve head blood flow was observed in these models Cioffi and Sullivan , 1999 Oku et al. , 1999 Orgul et al. , 1996 . Some glaucoma patients suffer from vasospastic syndrome , a condition that is associated with systemic vascular dysregulation that either manifests as excessive arterial constriction vasospasm or as inappropriate dilatation of vessels Flammer et al. , 2001 . This disease can be subdivided into primary and secondary vascular dysregulation syndrome . Patients who are affected by primary vascular dysregulation syndrome tend to have cold hands , some-times also cold feet , low blood pressure , elevated plasma ET-1 levels , migraine and reduced feeling of thirst . It is more frequently diagnosed in females than in males , and in people with low body mass index BMI . It occurs in different organs , and may also affect the eye . Secondary vascular dysregulation syndrome is associated with other systemic diseases but shows no relation to glaucoma Flammer et al. , 2002 Grieshaber et al. , 2007 . Emre et al. 2004 investigated POAG patients over three years , separating them into two clusters , one including patients with higher ocular blood flow parameters and the other one including patients with lower blood flow parameters . By analyzing the data , a statistical association between altered ocular blood flow and vasospastic propensity was discovered Emre et al. , 2004 . Whether alterations in the endo-thelin system are , however , truly related to abnormal autor-egulation in glaucoma remains unclear . 7 . Conclusions 1 . Autoregulation is a very complex phenomenon . The mecha-nisms underlying autoregulation in the human eye are not well understood . 2 . If a vascular bed is autoregulated and perfusion pressure is changed , blood flow can be kept constant within the limits of autoregulation . This does , however , not mean that the change in OPP has no hemodynamic consequence , because the autor-egulatory reserve is altered . 3 . There is evidence that in the human choroid , blood flow is better regulated during isometric exercise-induced changes in mean arterial pressure than during changes in IOP induced by a suction cup . This may be due to a myogenic or a neural mechanism . Whether this is also true for ONH blood flow is unclear and remains to be investigated . The phenomenon may , however , have significant impact in glaucoma , because alter-ations in IOP may have more impact on blood flow and its regulation than alteration in arterial pressure . 4 . There is evidence that glaucoma patients show abnormal autoregulation . The reasons for abnormal autoregulation in this disease are largely unknown , there is , however , evidence that reducing IOP improves autoregulation in glaucoma patients . 5 . Given these results it seems reasonable to assume that low OPP is a risk factor for glaucoma , because it pre-disposes for period of ischemia during changes in mean arterial pressure and spikes in IOP . This phenomenon is aggravated by abnormal autoregulation . A therapeutic reduction in IOP does not only increase OPP , but also may improve the regulatory capacity of the ocular vasculature thereby reducing the likelihood of such ischemic periods .

How IOP plays a role in the retinal ganglion cell loss characteristic of glaucoma is unclear however , both IOP-dependent biomechanical and vascular effects have been suggested . The biomechanical model of the disease proposes that IOP-induced mechanical strain on the optic nerve head ONH leads to a cascade of events eventually culminating in retinal ganglion cell dysfunction and apoptosis Burgoyne et al. , 2005 Quigley et al. , 1980 . The mechanisms behind this cascade are not yet fully understood , although studies have identified the lamina cribrosa LC as an important site of damage Quigley et al. , 1980 , 1981 , 1983 . Although associated with elevated IOP , glaucoma is known to occur across the entire spectrum of IOP levels , suggesting the link between IOP and vision loss in glaucoma is complex Sommer et al. , 1991 . It is possible that inter-individual differences in the biome-chanics of the eye may play a role in determining an individual�s susceptibility to glaucomatous optic neuropathy . In particular , as the principal load-bearing tissue of the eye , the sclera likely plays a significant biomechanical role in the eye�s response to IOP Ethier , 2006 . Previous work Sigal et al. , 2004 , 2005 , 2009a , b shows that IOP-induced scleral deformations are transferred to the tissues of the ONH , including the LC . Significant differences in scleral thick-ness and geometry have been observed both by our group and others Olsen et al. , 1998 Norman et al. , 2010 , suggesting that there may also be wide variation in biomechanical behavior of the ONH . Furthermore , evidence of differences in scleral geometry in glaucomatous eyes , including thinning near the ONH , has been observed in both human Ren et al. , 2009 Norman et al. , 2010 and monkey eyes Downs et al. , 2001 . It therefore seems likely that it is important to consider these individual details when characterizing the biomechanics of the ONH . Given the difficulty of directly measuring the biomechanics of the eye , most current work uses modeling . Some analytical modeling has been performed Dongqi and Zeqin , 1999 Edwards and Good , 2001 , but was subject to significant limitations due to the complexity of the geometry of the ONH . For this reason , researchers have adopted computational modeling using the finite element method , and much insight into the biomechanical behavior of the tissues of the ONH has been gained from succes-sively more sophisticated models e.g . Bellezza et al. , 2000 Sigal et al. , 2004 , 2005 . Previous studies have shown that scleral material properties , geometry , and thickness have significant effects on the biome-chanical environment of the ONH Cahane and Bartov , 1992 Sigal et al. , 2005 . However , these studies both used uniform thickness spherical scleral shells , which is a significant simplification from physiological reality . Work with monkey eyes suggests a significant biomechanical role for the sclera Girard et al. , 2009a , b . Here our goal was to investigate the effects of physiologically realistic corneoscleral shell geometry on ONH biomechanics in human eyes . We did this by considering individual-specific and idealized �variable-geometry� corneoscleral shells based on MRI scans dis-cussed previously Norman et al. , 2010 . A �generic� optic nerve head ONH constructed using measurements from the literature Sigal et al. , 2004 was then placed into these shells , and the effects of different scleral shell anatomy on ONH biomechanics were computed . We find substantial biomechanical variations between individual eyes due to the sclera alone , and correlations between corneoscleral shell properties specifically , scleral thickness , axial length , and shape and the biomechanical environment in the ONH . 2 . Materials and methods The eyes were prepared , and the corneoscleral shell was imaged , segmented and measured using a technique described previously Norman et al. , 2010 . Briefly , 11 enucleated human donor eyes were obtained from the Eye Bank of Canada within 24 h post-mortem . Seven of these eyes were identified as normal , while four were reported as glaucomatous by family members . The eyes were fixed with 10 % formalin in phosphate buffered saline for 24 h at either 5 mmHg right eyes n ? 5 or 50 mmHg left eyes n ? 6 . They were then scanned with a T1-weighted spin-echo 3-D protocol using a 7.0 T MRI scanner Varian , Inc. , Palo Alto , CA , providing 80 mm isotropic resolution over the whole eye . Amira 3.11 software Mercury Computer Systems , Inc. , Chelmsford , MA was used to segment the MRI images , perform thickness measurements on the corneoscleral shell , and generate the 3-D meshes used in the measurement process . MATLAB The Mathworks , Inc. , Natick , MA was used to post-process the thickness results . The eyes were oriented along an anterior-posterior axis running from the center of the ONH through the center of the cornea , and 15 equal radial length circumferential slices were made along this axis . Average scleral thickness was calculated for each circumferential slice , producing 15 measurements to characterize the thickness distri-bution of the corneoscleral shell . 2.1 . Individual-specific models This study aimed to determine the effects of physiologic varia-tions in scleral geometry on the biomechanics of the ONH . In order to create a common basis for comparison between all models , an identical generic ONH geometry was chosen for all eyes . This had the advantage of separating the effects of the individual-specific corneoscleral shells from variations in ONH geometry and is a natural follow-up to previous work Sigal et al. , 2009a identifying the sclera as a key biomechanical component in the eye�s response to IOP . This previous study placed individual-specific ONHs into a generic scleral shell in order to understand the contribution of individual-specific ONH geometry to ocular biomechanics . The experiment described here examines the opposite scenar-iodindividual-specific scleral geometry combined with a generic ONHdin order to isolate the effect of scleral geometry on ocular biomechanics . The generic ONH used in all corneoscleral shells was created from the geometry described in Sigal et al. 2004 and Sigal et al. 2005 . It consisted of the peripapillary sclera , the LC , prel-aminar neural tissue the retina and choroid , postlaminar neural tissue the optic nerve , and the pia mater , and was symmetrical about a central axis axisymmetric . The ostensibly glaucomatous shells , as discussed previously Norman et al. , 2010 , were found to have smaller ONH canal radii and thinner posterior sclera than the normal eyes . The generic ONH geometry was found to be too big to fit in the ostensibly glau-comatous shells . For this reason , the glaucomatous shells were not included in the individual-specific analysis , although their dimen-sions were considered in an idealized analysis discussed below . In order to ensure a consistent ONH insertion into the sclera , the generic ONH was aligned into all seven shells using a MATLAB implementation of the iterative closest point ICP registration algorithm Zhang , 1994 . This algorithm minimizes the distance between two surfaces by minimizing an associated cost function . In this study , the cost was the sum of two components that measured the distances between the respective anterior scleral surfaces and ONH canal walls of the ONH and corneoscleral shell . Minimizing the former served to align the anterior scleral surface of the ONH with the interior scleral surface of the corneoscleral shell , whereas minimizing the latter helped to align the scleral canal in the ONH model with the scleral canal in the corneoscleral shell . A low-modulus interface material see below was inserted in areas where a stepped edge remained . In cases where the physiological scleral thickness exceeded that of the idealized sclera , all physiological sclera was conserved . Fig. 1 shows an example of a generic ONH inserted into an individual-specific corneoscleral shell . The oriented ONHs were then combined with the individual-specific shells using voxel addition in Amira . The resulting surfaces were simplified to approximately 240,000 surface elements when volume-meshed , this corresponded to approximately 1,000,000 10-noded tetrahedral finite elements . The geometry was exported into ANSYS 11.0 ANSYS Inc. , Canonsburg , PA , a commercial finite element analysis package , using a custom script . To provide addi-tional geometrical detail in the ONH region , submodeling was performed . This involved creating a second , more-refined model of only the ONH and surrounding sclera for each eye . The boundary conditions and submodels were created using a methodology similar to the one described in Beisheim and Sinclair , 2003 using tools in ANSYS . Numerical convergence was tested using a pub-lished technique Beisheim and Sinclair , 2003 . Calculated dis-cretization and boundary condition error , two measures of convergence in submodeling , were both less than 1 % . Model parameters matched those used in a previous study Sigal et al. , 2004 . Tissues were assumed to be linearly elastic , isotropic , and incompressible , although a Poisson ratio of 0.49 rather than 0.50 was selected to avoid non-convergent numerical behavior . This has previously been demonstrated to have little effect on results Sigal et al. , 2004 . Tissue elastic moduli were based on those published in the literature sclera 3 MPa , LC 0.3 MPa , pre-and post-laminar neural tissue 0.03 MPa , and pia mater 3 MPa . The interface material was assigned a modulus of 0.03 MPa . The eye models were pressurized to 30 mmHg from a resting pressure of 0 mmHg . Nodes at the apex of the cornea were constrained in all degrees of freedom , with the eye models otherwise free to inflate . Results were post-processed using ANSYS and Excel Microsoft , Inc. , Redmond , WA . Mean and peak 95th percentile 1st , 2nd , and 3rd principal strains in the LC were used as outcome measures . Strain represents the amount of stretch a tissue undergoes in response to a load . This deformation may be important in glaucomatous damage Burgoyne et al. , 2005 Sigal and Ethier , 2009 . Defining a representative strain quantity can be complex due to the fact that strain is a tensor quantity , and so it can not be specified completely by a single value at a given location . Typically , this is accounted for by using principal strains , a formulation where strain at a given location can be rep-resented by three orthogonal values known as the 1st , 2nd , and 3rd principal strains . In the eye , the first principal strain can be physi-cally interpreted as the maximum tissue extension , while the third principal strain represents the maximum tissue compression indicated by a negative sign Sigal et al. , 2007 . The reporting of strain is further complicated by the fact that , in general , a given strain measure will vary with position , so that for example , the LC experiences a distribution of strains over its volume . To account for this , we report the 95th percentile strain in the LC , i.e. the strain magnitude for which 95 % of computed strain values in the lamina are smaller and 5 % are greater . The top 5 % of strain values were not considered as they could be the result of localized strain extrema caused by distortions in the finite element mesh , and hence might not be physically meaningful . The 95th percentile strain should therefore be considered as a measure of the peak strain experi-enced in the LC , which we assume represents the most potent mechanical stimulus experienced by the LC . The mean strain within the LC will be less than this 95th percentile peak value . 2.2 . Idealized axisymmetric corneoscleral shell Although physiologically accurate , the complex geometry of the individual-specific corneoscleral shell models made it diffi-cult to identify which geometrical factors had the greatest influence on strains in the LC . Also , due to the variability in shell geometry , we decided to exclude the glaucomatous shells from the individual-specific analysis . To estimate the relative impor-tance of different features of the geometry of the sclera and consider a broader range of scleral geometries , an axisymmetric scleral shell was constructed in ANSYS for use in a sensitivity analysis . An axisymmetric ONH geometry identical to the one used in the individual-specific corneoscleral shells was incorpo-rated into this axisymmetric model . The models were meshed in a manner similar to one described previously Sigal et al. , 2004 . Material properties matched those used in the individual-specific models . The geometry of the axisymmetric shell was designed to allow independent adjustment of eye size , shape , and scleral thickness to facilitate modeling a wide range of eyes . Fig. 2 shows an example of the axisymmetric scleral model with all adjustable factors labeled . Table 1 lists the factors and their respective ranges . Each range was defined by the physiological range measured over the 11 human eyes included in this study . Thickness was specified using the circumferential average scleral thickness i.e. the average across all four quadrants measured for each slice in an earlier scleral thick-ness study Norman et al. , 2010 . As illustrated in Fig. 3 and described in detail below , the shell was composed of two regions a truncated sphere forming the posterior sclera and a truncated ellipsoid forming the anterior sclera . Although a simpler spherical shell was originally tested as had been used previously Bellezza et al. , 2000 Cahane and Bartov , 1992 Sigal et al. , 2004 , it was found to match poorly with the shape of axially-elongated eyes , of which there were several in this study . Correctly representing axial elongation was judged to be important , since the companion paper and the literature Ren et al. , 2009 has observed that this feature is present in some glaucomatous eyes . Fig. 4 compares spherical and two region shells fitted to the dimensions of an actual axially-elongated eye . The fitting procedure was as follows the radius termed �posterior radius� in Fig. 2 of the truncated sphere was determined by fitting a sphere to the posterior and posterior-equatorial scleral regions Fig. 2 . These regions were chosen since they gave the best approximation of the shape of the posterior sclera . Using smaller regions closer to the ONH for fitting tended to result in measure-ments that were influenced significantly by local geometry fluc-tuations . Using larger regions e.g. the posterior hemisphere in axially elongated eyes tended to result in a sphere that did not match the shape of the sclera close to the ONH . The actual fitting to the posterior and posterior-equatorial regions was done in MATLAB using a technique that minimized the distance between the sphere�s surface and the scleral surface by varying the sphere�s location and radius . After the truncated sphere was defined , the truncated ellipsoid was determined as follows the truncated sphere and the truncated ellipsoid were forced to meet at the equator and their slopes were forced to match at the junction , so that the scleral surface was smooth and free of non-physiological sharp intersections that might affect the biomechanics . Finally , the truncated ellipsoid was chosen so that the model had the correct axial length of the eye . Shell thickness was independently adjustable in each of the 15 regions described in our previous study of scleral thickness Fig. 2 Norman et al. , 2010 . Splines were fit between adjacent regions to ensure a smooth transition between regions of different thickness at the intersections of two splines , the slopes of the end segments were set equal to one another . Although idealized , the axisymmetric models should be biomechanically representative of the physiological individual-specific shells . To confirm this , an axisymmetric model was created from each individual-specific shell , and the axisymmetric model and its corresponding individual-specific shell were biomechani-cally analyzed in ANSYS . Comparing mean 1st , 2nd , and 3rd prin-cipal strains in the LC between corresponding models indicates that the axisymmetric models served as reasonable estimators of LC strain in the individual-specific models despite being greatly simplified the average relative difference in percent strain calcu-lated was 8.0 % e.g. if 5 % strain was calculated in the LC of the 2D model , then a strain of between 4.6 % and 5.4 % would be expected in the 3D model . Similar tests with spherical axisymmetric shells showed greater errors , supporting the decision to use a two region model . Furthermore , the two region model allowed independent variation of axial length and shape at the posterior of the eye during the sensitivity analysis . Table 1 Factors and ranges used in sensitivity analysis . All measurements expressed in mm Factor Minimum Maximum 2.3 . Sensitivity analysis We conducted a sensitivity analysis to characterize the effect of each geometric factor e.g . peripapillary scleral thickness on a given response variable e.g . 95th percentile 1st principal strain in the LC . Because we could vary each factor in the axisymmetric shell independently , the effects were clearer than in the individual - specific models , where the effects of all factors are confounded . The sensitivity analysis was performed using a 2k factorial design technique one variant of the Design of Experiments method in ANSYS Allen , 2006 Montgomery et al. , 2004 . This approach has been shown to be superior to a conventional sensitivity analysis where each factor is varied individually with the others held constant , since it varies all factors simultaneously through this approach , factor interactions , where , for example , the effects of two factors varied together is different from their individual effects , can then be accounted for Sigal , 2009 . It also allows a quantitative determination of the relative strength of different factors in terms of their effects on a response variable . Briefly , a factorial design evaluates models at the maximum and minimum value of each factor and observes the effect on a chosen response variable . This leads to 2k experiments where k is the number of factors , corre-sponding to all possible combinations of conditions . The effect of a factor on a response variable was determined by calculating the main effect and two and three factor interactions . Briefly see Montgomery et al. , 2004 Allen , 2006 for details , the main effect is an aggregate measure that estimates the overall impact on the response variable by comparing all of the models where a factor is at its maximum to all of the models where it is at its minimum . It is expressed in the units of the response variable so , if modeling the effect of a factor on displacement in mm , the main effect will be expressed in mm , and estimates the average effect of varying the factor over the specified range . Two and three factor interactions measure the effects of all pairings e.g . axial length and slice 1 thickness and triplings e.g . axial length , slice 1 thickness , and equatorial thickness on the response variable . Calculating an interaction involves comparing cases where all factors are assigned to the same value i.e. their respective maxi-mums or minimums versus cases where their values differ e.g. one factor at maximum and another factor at minimum in the case of a pair . Interactions are also expressed in the units of the response variable . They can be informative as they can identify cases where the behavior of the response variable is different from what would be expected by the main effect of a factor . In the factorial design used in this study , seven factors were varied thicknesses in scleral slices 1 through 3 , thickness of the posterior-equatorial scleral region , thickness of the equatorial scleral region , axial eye length , and posterior eye radius . The thickness of the corneal region was held constant at 551 mm , an average value taken from the literature Wolfs et al. , 1997 Yaylali et al. , 1997 . The choice of factors was motivated in part by linear discriminant analysis of the results of the individual-specific eyes Norman , 2008 . The posterior region of the sclera was split into its component slices slices 1e3 to provide additional detail in the 3 . Results 3.1 . Individual-specific models Large variations in LC strain were observed between different corneoscleral shells Fig. 5 mean first , second , and third principal strains measured 2.1 % to 3.1 % , 1.3 % to 2.2 % , and 3.4 % to 5.1 % , respectively , over the 11 eyes 95th percentile first , second , and third principal strain measured 2.4 % to 4.6 % , 1.6 % to 3.2 % , and 3.8 % to 7.3 % , respectively . This suggests that geometry differences between corneoscleral shells can have significant biomechanical consequences for ONH tissues . 3.2 . Sensitivity analysis using idealized axisymmetric corneoscleral shell Significant variations in LC strains and scleral canal radial displacement were observed over the physiological range of factors included in the factorial design 95th percentile first principal strain in the LC varied from 1.9 % to 5.2 % and ONH canal radial displace-ment varied from 16 mm to 40 mm over the 128 models . Mean strain across the whole LC varied between 1.8 % and 3.6 % over the models . Fig. 6 shows the main effects and significant interactions calculated in the study . It is clear that the relative importance of each factor was strongly correlated between the two measures 95th percentile first principal strain in the LC and ONH canal radial displacement , suggesting consistent effects on ONH biomechanics . The two factor and three factor interactions not shown on the plot were all at least an order of magnitude lower than the main effects and so were considered negligible . The sensitivity analysis showed that slice 1 thickness , i.e. the thickness of the peripapillary sclera , played by far the most significant role in the biomechanical response of the ONH the magnitude of its main effect was 70 % of the entire range of strain and displacement seen across all models . The posterior radius had a smaller but still significant effect , suggesting that the shape of the posterior of the eye can alter its biomechanical response . The positive correlation of increased posterior radius with increased strain and displacement suggests that a flatter posterior sclera i.e. one with lower curvature may lead to higher biomechanical loads in the ONH . Increasing the thickness of slices 2 and 3 slightly increased strain and displacement in the LC rather than decreasing it , contrary to the effect of slice 1 thickness . Examination of modeling results showed that this was due to a change in the geometry of the loading of the ONH Fig. 7 , which may be indicative of a peculiarity of the model geometry , but could also represent more complex mechanical interactions between the tissues of the eye . It is possible that particular scleral geometries may transfer their IOP-induced deformations more effectively to the LC than others . The interactions observed in the factorial design support the idea that the interplay of different geometrical characteristics can lead to more complex effects . Given the dominant effect of slice 1 scleral thickness on the biomechanics of the ONH , an investigation was performed to observe its importance relative to changes in IOP . Ten models with slice 1 thicknesses spaced evenly across the physiological range observed over the 11 eyes 720 mm to 1326 mm were elevated from 0 mmHg to normal 15 mmHg and significantly elevated 30 mmHg IOP levels . Axial length , posterior radius , and the other regional thicknesses were all set to average values . The results showed that varying slice 1 thickness over the physiological range resulted in a change in 95th percentile 1st principal LC strain and radial ONH canal displacement equivalent to a 15 mmHg change in IOP Fig. 8 . This suggests that eyes with thinned peripapillary scleradas may be the case in glaucomatous eyesdmay be vastly more sensitive to IOP than eyes with thicker sclera . 4 . Discussion The goal of this study was to characterize the effect of scleral shell anatomy geometry on ONH biomechanics , and to specifically identify which geometrical features of the sclera were most influ-ential in ONH biomechanics . This information is valuable for developing more physiologically accurate ocular biomechanical models and may provide insight into the relationship between IOP and the development of glaucomatous optic neuropathy . A major result of this work was the observation of a large vari-ation in ONH biomechanical response across different eyes 95th percentile first principal strain in the LC , ONH radial canal displacement , and mean strain across the LC all varied by more than a factor of two across the range of models in the sensitivity analysis . This is strong evidence that the anatomy of the sclera can have significant effects on the biomechanics of the ONH . One implication is that future ocular biomechanical models of the ONH should incorporate a physiologically-representative sclera . The results of the sensitivity analysis suggest that matching the characteristics of the peripapillary sclera is most important . More generally , this observation confirms that there may be significant inter-individual differences in biomechanical behavior stemming from differences in the anatomy of the sclera . The indi-vidual-specific models support this strongly strain level varied across the eyes by between 47 and 100 percent , depending on the strain quantity measured . Perhaps even more significant is the fact that this variation was observed over only seven eyesdlarger differences in anatomy likely exist across the entire population . Furthermore , the range of LC strain observed in both studies reach the threshold of what may be biologically significant in vitro studies of neuronal cells found a wide range of biological effects at strains of 5e6 % Edwards and Good , 2001 Margulies and Thibault , 1992 . The sensitivity analysis helped identify what geometrical traits of the eye would result in the greatest sensitivity to IOP . We found that the thickness of the posterior scleradand particularly that of the peripapillary sclera defined by slice 1dhad a strong effect on the biomechanics of the ONH . This is of particular interest in light of previous observations of scleral thinning in glaucoma . The source of this thinning is unclear , but there is some evidence that it is the result of scleral remodeling , perhaps in response to IOP . Studies in the literature have linked posterior scleral thinning in both humans and monkeys with elevated IOP Downs et al. , 2001 Tane and Kohno , 1986 . If this is the case , it could have a significant effect on the biomechanical response of the ONH to IOP . The potential importance of this is illustrated by our modeling of the effect of varying slice 1 peripapillary scleral thickness versus IOP level . The results show that varying peripapillary scleral thickness alone over the observed physiological range is equivalent to a significant change in IOP level . Considering the likelihood that other significant factors such as the geometry and material prop-erties of the ONH also vary between individuals , structural differ-ences between eyes could lead to vastly different sensitivity to IOP . The large variation in strain level seen in the individual-specific models supports this hypothesis . These observations could also explain IOP�s complex relationship with the development of glaucoma . This study is subject to several limitations . The most important limitation is that our study only examined the effects of scleral thickness on ONH biomechanics and did not investigate differences in scleral material properties , which have previously been demon-strated to have a strong effect on ONH biomechanics Sigal et al. , 2005 Sigal , 2009 . It is possible that there is a compensatory mechanismwherebyindividualswiththinnersclerahavetissuethat is stiffer , resulting in similar biomechanical behavior to a thicker , weaker tissue . Reported material properties for human sclera vary widely Sigal et al. , 2004 , suggesting that there could be significant inter-individual differences . Although technically challenging , it therefore seems very important to examine how stiffness and thickness co-vary in the sclera , although preliminary data Eilaghi et al. , 2009 suggest that the co-variance may be small . Assuming linear material properties for the tissues of the ONH is a simplification . However , there is still surprisingly little informa-tion on the nonlinear properties of ONH tissues . To the best of our knowledge there is no published data on the nonlinear properties of the LC , the prelaminar or retrolaminar tissues , or the pia mater . There are , however , some recent reports on the nonlinear proper-ties of the sclera Girard et al. , 2009a , b Spoerl et al. , 2005 , although these data were collected either in monkey eyes or at high strain . Work is currently underway to incorporate nonlinear material properties into future models . Our selection of material properties is consistent with recently published models of the posterior pole , such as those of Roberts and Downs Downs et al. , 2009 Roberts et al. , 2010 and Sigal Sigal et al. , 2009a , b Sigal , 2009 . Also , although tissues are usually thought of as visco-elastic , the slow development of glaucomatous damage , which typically occurs over months or years , means that assuming elastic behavior is reasonable . Also to be considered when interpreting the results is our choice of outcome measures . Although these were chosen based on our best understanding of the physiology of the ONH , they are ulti-mately arbitrary . However , the outcome measures we chose are certainly indicative of biomechanical differences between eyes , whether or not they directly represent the mechanical effects that may play a role in the pathophysiology of glaucoma , and have been used in several previous biomechanical studies of the ONH Edwards and Good , 2001 Roberts et al. , 2010 Sander et al. , 2006 Sigal et al. , 2005 Sigal et al. , 2009a , b . Many of the parameters used in this study were idealized . All models used an identical idealized ONH in order to facilitate comparisons . Because of this , any differences in the ONH region , which could likely lead to significant variability in results , are not accounted for . Furthermore , all models employed highly idealized material properties , which likely have a great effect on the outcome measures . Although it would be interesting to include more real-istic material properties , precious few are currently readily available . Despite these downsides , however , these simplifications also confer some benefits idealizations make it easier to identify and interpret some effects and , in our case , enable straightforward comparisons . Although more robust than a conventional sensitivity analysis , factorial design still has limitations . The main effects calculated are dependent on the range specified for a given factor , meaning that a larger range may result in a greater main effect . This potential pitfall , however , has applied to all published sensitivity analyses Sigal et al. , 2004 , 2005 , 2009a , b . This work , however , improves upon these by using ranges determined from direct measurements of human eyes , meaning that they are representative of the actual physiological range . Our use of an axisymmetric model in the sensitivity analysis means that we are unable to comment on the potentially inter-esting effects of differences in scleral thickness between quadrants . An axisymmetric model was chosen to simplify interpretation of the data . Furthermore , for this analysis we assumed that factors varied independently of each other e.g . thickness at the pole was not associated with thickness at the equator , which may not be the case in vivo . We varied the factors independently for two reasons first , because factor covariations are unknown second , because this allowed us to determine factor influences both independently and in interaction . From the factor influences identified from inde-pendent variations it would be relatively straightforward to determine the factor combined effects if and when factor covaria-tions are measured experimentally . The 3-D physiological shells used in this work were pressurized to 5 mmHg or 30 mmHg as previously described . A non-zero pres-sure was necessary in order to avoid artefactual effects such as folding of the tissue during imaging . In all modeling , however , the initial pressure was assumed to be zero . Although reasonable in the case of the eyes fixed at 5 mmHg , this appears counterintuitive for the eyes fixed at 50 mmHg . Previous simulations and experimental studies in both human Sigal et al. , 2010 and monkey Roberts et al. , 2010 Yanget al. , 2009 have reported that IOP-related deformations are small compared with inter-individual variations , however . This is consistent with our observation of no statistically significant differences in scleral geometry at the different fixation pressures Norman et al. , 2010 , although this may be due to limitations of our imaging resolution . Hence we believe that it was reasonable to assume all models to be at the same initial zero pressure . In summary , we have modeled the biomechanics of both individual-specific corneoscleral shells and idealized axisymmetric corneoscleral shells in order to better understand the effect of inter-individual differences in scleral anatomy on the biome-chanics of the ONH . At a constant IOP level , we found large vari-ations in both strain in the LC and ONH canal displacement across the different models , confirming that the sclera plays a significant biomechanical role . Sensitivity analysis revealed that the vast majority of these variations were caused by the sclera directly adjacent to the ONH peripapillary sclera and that the thickness of this region had a strong effect on ONH biomechanics . Pairing this observation with evidence that this region may thin in glau-coma suggests that the sclera may play a significant biomechanical role in the disease . Further investigation of the thickness and material properties of this region in normal and glaucomatous eyes may be informative .

Recent technical developments have focused on identifying specific gene expression signatures associated with tumor staging and patient prognosis to improve prognosis and therapy.1 Interestingly , microRNAs miRNAs tumor expression appears to be more accurate in determining the classification of cancer subtypes than classical mRNA expression profiles.2 These findings supported the concept of a specific miRNAs signature in solid tumors.3 Indeed , a growing number of miRNAs , such as those of the let-7 and miR-34 families , or the cluster miR-17-92 have been demon-strated to target genes that have an important role in lung carcinogenesis.4 Although much progress concerning our understanding of miRNA function has been made , the identification of www.nature.com cdd their targets still remains a limiting and difficult step.5 In the current molecular framework , mature miRNA , charged into a complex called miRNA-induced silencing complex miRISC , which contains proteins of the Argonaute family , interact with complementary site s , often located in the 30-untranslated region UTR of a target mRNA . The current paradigm states that the interaction between the miRNA and its targets stems from a short stretch of six to eight nucleotides located at 50 of the miRNA , termed the �seed sequence�.6 miRISC complexes can relocate target mRNAs to specialized compartments , the processing bodies , where translation blockade or mRNA decay occur . Destabi-lization of mRNA induced by miRNA is substantiated by many studies . Combined with computational predictions , measurement of expression profiles for mRNAs represents a powerful approach to identify functional miRNA�target relationships.7�9 We analyzed here the expression of miRNAs in a panel of biopsies of human non-small cell lung carcinomas NSCLCs and found that miR-210 was preferentially detected in late-stage tumors . Recent studies have identified miR-210 among a set of hypoxia-regulated miRNAs and demonstrated the direct regulatory role of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha HIF-1a in its transcription.10�12 Contradictory data however exist concerning the regulation and roles of miR-210 during cancer progression . miR-210 appears to be overexpressed in most solid tumors10,12�15 but absent in ovarian carcinoma.11 Furthermore , it has been shown that depending on the tissue type or cellular model , miR-210 was able to either promote entry into the cell cycle15 and to inhibit apoptosis16,17 or rather to repress tumor initiation.12 Several miR-210 targets have been investigated more specifically in the context of cancer , including cell-cycle regulator E2F3,11 homeobox proteins HOXA1 , HOXA9 , 12 the myc antagnonist MNT15 and the Iron Sulfur Cluster Assembly Proteins ISCU1 2,18 which are involved in many cellular processes such as heme biosynthesis and iron metabolism . In this study , we provide evidence that miR-210 targets specific mitochondrial components with consequences on the regulation of cell death and survival and the modulation of HIF-1 activity . Results miR-210 is highly expressed at a late stage of lung cancers . miRNA expression was analyzed in 20 pairs of human NSCLC i.e. , pathological versus matched control tissues from the same patient , clinical characteristics listed in Supplementary Table S1 using methods described else-where.9,19 We identified 33 miRNAs of interest , 13 being common with the study of Yanaihara et al.20 Supplementary Table S2 . Figure 1a shows a heat map where the columns represent these 20 pairs of miRNA samples tumor versus control split into three groups according to their patho-logical tumor node and metastasis staging and where the rows correspond to the selection of these 33 miRNAs supplemented with 13 additional miRNAs previously described for this pathology , such as members of the let-7 and the miR-34 families . We also looked at individual miRNAs , the expression of which would differ during disease progression . We found three miRNAs with such a profile miR-31 , miR-210 and miR-451 . Although miR-21 , a well-known oncogenic miRNA present in most epithelial malignancies , was already found overexpressed at an early stage , higher expression of miR-210 and miR-31 , and lower expression of miR-451 was usually associated with late stages of the disease Figure 1a . We then focused our attention on one of these candidates , the HIF-1-regulated miR-210 , based on previous reports suggesting a strong association between hypoxia and poor outcome in NSCLC.21,22 miR-210 expression correlates with a hypoxic signature in NSCLC and is upregulated by hypoxia in vitro . To compare miR-210 expression with a hypoxic signature , we first established the mRNA expression profiles of a subset of 13 biopsies from our initial NSCLC samples . The expression values of transcripts corresponding to a highly prognostic hypoxia signature consisting of a small number of top-ranked hypoxic genes , including VEGFA , SLC2A1 and PGAM1 derived from a large meta-analysis of multiple cancers including lung cancer23 was used to set up a hypoxic index . The miR-210 levels in tumors showed positive corre-lation to this hypoxic index Figure 1b and Supplementary Table S3 . Finally , using TaqMan quantitative q RT-PCR , miR-210 was significantly induced in A549 cells under hypoxic condition Figure 1c , and this hypoxic induction was dependent on HIF-1a but not HIF-2a Supplementary Figure S1 as previously reported in other models.12,24 miR-210 alters cell viability and enhances caspase-3 7 activity in A549 cells in normoxia . Giannakakis et al. , 11 using several bioinformatic predictions of miRNA targets , reported that miR-210 can target the transcript coding for the E2F family protein E2F3 . Interestingly , E2F3 has also been identified as a target for the p53-regulated miR-34a.25 As miR-34a was also found slightly upregulated in some patients Figure 1a , we compared the effect of miR-210 with miR-34a and an siRNA against E2F3 si-E2F3 on E2F3 expression . miR-210 transfection led to a strong decrease in E2F3 protein expression Figure 2a . A luciferase reporter assay with the E2F3 30UTR fused to luciferase showed that miR-210 directly targets E2F3 Figure 2b . We then compared ectopic expression of miR-210 , miR-34a and si-E2F3 on A549 cell viability and proliferation using the 2,3-bis 2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl -2H-tetrazolium-5-carboxanilide XTT cell proliferation assay . After a transfection with miR-210 and si-E2F3 , the number of A549 cells decreased over 5 days compared with the control miR-Neg and si-Neg Figure 2c . Meanwhile , A549 cells transfected with miR-34a escaped inhibition after 3 days . Interestingly , caspase-3 7 activity assays revealed significant induction of apoptosis in A549 cells by miR-210 but not by si-E2F3 or miR-34a Figure 2d . Identification of miR-210 targets by mRNA profiling of A549 cells overexpressing miR-210 . The influence of miR-210 , miR-34a and si-E2F3 on transcript levels was investigated with human pangenomic arrays.26 Ectopic expres-sion of miR-210 and miR-34a induced very different patterns of modulations Figure 3a see Supplementary Table S4 for the complete list of miR-210 deregulated transcripts . Moreover , a large number of changes induced by si-E2F3 were shared with miR-34a but not with miR-210 Figure 3a , group 2 , confirming that miR-210 acts probably through a distinct mechanism . A functional annotation of the different signature patterns with the Ingenuity Pathway software Ingenuity Systems , Redwood City , CA , USA was then performed . Although there was an important overlap for �molecular functions� terms such as �Cell Death� , �Cellular Growth and Proliferation� or �Cell Cycle� between miR-210 , miR-34a and si-E2F3 Supplementary Table S5 , we found some �canonical pathways� specific to one or the other experimental conditions Supplementary Table S6 . As expected , the most significant pathway associated with miR-34 was �p53 signalling� P ? 3.7 10 7 . The score of several metabolic pathways altered by the presence of miR-210 was explained by its effects on several genes encoding aldehyde dehydrogenases , but we also noticed enrichment for a pathway related to �Mitochondria Dysfunction� Supplementary Table S6 . This particularly interesting latter observation was explained by down-regulation of several members of complexes I and II of the electron transport chain ETC Supplementary Figure S2 . We next looked for putative miR-210 direct targets in the population of downregulated transcripts using our web tool �MicrotopTable� Figures 3b�d .9 They indicate a specific overrepresentation of miR-210-and miR-34a-predicted targets in the transcripts downregulated after hetero-logous expression of both miRNAs . We then focussed our analysis on 38 transcripts containing miR-210 complementary hexamers in their 30UTR that show the largest inhibition of expression Table 1 . When this set of genes was functionally annotated , we found an enrichment for mitochondrial components Supplementary Table S7 , explained in part by the presence of two members of ETC complexes NADH dehydrogenase ubiquinone 1 alpha subcomplex , 4 NDUFA4 , a subunit of ETC complex I , and succinate dehydrogenase complex , subunit D SDHD , a subunit of the ETC complex II . miR-210 directly targets NDUFA4 and SDHD and induces mitochondrial dysfunctions . To test whether NDUFA4 and SDHD were directly targeted by miR-210 , we fused the 30UTR of SDHD and NDUFA4 to a luciferase reporter . Co-transfection with a synthetic pre-miR-210 significantly decreased the luciferase activity compared with a pre-miR-Neg , strongly suggesting that both genes are miR-210 targets Figure 4a . In the absence of specific antibodies against these two proteins , we performed western blot analysis on other subunits of these two ETC complexes Figure 4b . miR-210 decreased the level of expression of the 70 kDa ETC complex II subunit SDHA but it had no efffect on the 39 kDa ETC complex I subunit NDUFA9 and the 20 kDa ETC complex I NDUFS7 . Finally , the activity of ETC complex II was directly measured on cell lysates of A549 cells , 72 h following transfection with a pre-miR-Neg or pre-miR-210 . miR-210 specifically decreased succinate dehydrogenase SDH complex II activity compared with the miR-Neg control Figure 4c . Electron microscopy performed on miR-210-transfected A549 cells revealed mitochondrial structural alterations Figure 4d although the morphology of mitochondria in pre-miR-Neg transfected A549 cells appeared as a tubular network with normal internal membrane invaginations , miR-210-expressing cells showed enlarged mitochondria with a modified organization of cristae . These phenotypic modifications were indeed associated with mitochondrial dysfunctions , as evidenced by an altered mitochondrial membrane potential Dcm Supplementary Figure S3A . The direct effect of miR-210 on SDHD was then assessed with an siRNA-targeting SDHD si-SDHD . Silencing of SDHD with two different siRNAs mimicked the enlarged mitochon-drial phenotype observed with miR-210 Figure 5a and Supplementary Figure S3B . Both si-SDHD and miR-210 Symbol ID ABCC3 ABL1 ALDH5A1 C22orf9 CDCA7L DHFR DKFZp434H1419 EPB41L1 FAM102A FAM3C GIT2 H2AFY NDUFA4 SH3BGRL SIPA1L3 STAT6 TERF2IP TMEM80 NM_005216 H. sapiens dolichyl-diphosphooligosaccharide-protein Effects of miR-210 on cell survival and alteration in the phenotype of mitochondria in hypoxia . As alteration in mitochondrial function can lead to different consequences on cell death and survival in normoxia or hypoxia , we next performed clonogenic assays in which miR-210 was overexpressed or knocked down under normoxic or hypoxic conditions . As expected , transfection of a locked nucleic acid LNA inhibitor of miR-210 LNA-210 in hypoxic A549 cells reduced miR-210 expression to the low basal normoxic level when compared with an LNA-159s control inhibitor Figure 6a . Although transfection with a synthetic pre-miR-210 reduced clonogenic potential in normoxia Figure 6b , left , in agreement with our previous data on apoptosis and cell proliferation Figures 2 and 4 , treatment with LNA-210 resulted in decreased clonogenic survival of A549 cells following 72 h of hypoxia Figure 6b , right . We also quantified in the same experimental settings , alterations in the mitochondrial phenotype as visualized by electron microscopy , which showed that LNA-210 could indeed tions in SDH subunits have been shown to activate HIF-1,27,28 we next wondered whether miR-210 had a positive effect on HIF-1 activity . As controls , we also evaluated the effect of miR-34a as well as those of si-E2F3 and si-SDHD . We measured their impact on several luciferase reporter vectors downstream to a minimal promoter containing either E2F , p53 or a hypoxia-responsive element HRE Supplementary Figure S4 . As expected , both miR-210 and miR-34a duplexes , as well as si-E2F3 , induced a decrease in E2F reporter activity Supplementary Figure S4A , whereas miR-34a duplex alone could increase p53 reporter activity Supplementary Figure S4B . Of note , prolonged overexpression of the miR-210 duplex as well as silencing of SDHD resulted into a modest but significant increase of HRE luciferase reporter activity , suggesting that miR-210-mediated SDHD targeting leads to HIF-1a stabilization under normoxic conditions Supplementary Figure S4C . We next evaluated the level of expression and activity of HIF-1a in experiments in which miR-210 was overexpressed or knocked down under normoxic or hypoxic conditions Figure 7 . Overexpression of miR-210 in normoxic conditions only led to a slight increase in HIF-1a levels 72 h after transfection Figure 7a , in agreement with the HRE luciferase reporter data Supplementary Figure S4C . Importantly , inhibition of miR-210 in hypoxia decreased HIF-1a proteins levels after 48�72 h of hypoxia Figure 7a . After 48 h of hypoxia , HIF-1 activity , as assessed after co-transfection of a HRE luciferase reporter , was reduced by LNA-210 , and returned to basal values observed during normoxia Figure 7b . Finally , the LNA-210 also reduced hypoxia-mediated lactate production to a similar extent as an siRNA against HIF-1a Figure 7c . The global miRNA profile reported here Figure 1 is in good agreement with previous reports , 3,20 showing upregulation of miR-21 , miR-155 , miR-146a and miR-210 , and repression of miR-125a , miR-143 , miR-145 and miR-218 . Stratification of the samples according to their stages revealed distinct levels of expression for miR-31 , miR-210 and miR-451 among these groups . The low level of expression of miR-210 during early stages 1A , T1N0 and its progressive increase with growth and invasion of tumor cells fits well with previous reports showing a correlation between the well-characterized HIF-target carbonic anhydrase IX , hypoxia and advanced T stage.21,22 A good correlation was also noted between miR-210 expression and hypoxic markers in our cohort of patients , confirming that miR-210 expression was likely driven by hypoxia in vivo , as previously shown in other solid tumors.10,12 In an effort to better understand the function of miR-210 in lung tumor cells , we have first analyzed the consequences of miR-210 overexpression in A459 adenocarcinoma cells cultured under normoxic condition . Induction of apoptosis by miR-210 is consistent with very recent reports indicating that miR-210 represses the growth of tumor xenograft from head , neck and pancreatic cancer cells12 and increases apoptosis in pulmonary arterial endothelial cells HPAECs in vitro.18 While we confirmed that the transcript coding for E2F3 , a key protein in the cell cycle , is a functional target of miR-210,11 we also found that miR-210 induced cell death associated with activation of caspases , whereas E2F3 siRNA did not . Indeed , E2F3 silencing and miR-210 overexpressions led to very distinctive expression patterns , thus suggesting that the effect of miR-210-induced cell death was rather mediated by targeting other transcripts . Among the set of transcripts that were downregulated after ectopic expression of miR-210 , we restricted our work to a group of 38 transcripts containing miR-210 complementary hexamers in their 30UTR and possessing the strongest modulation factors and statistical P-values . Eight transcripts of this list have already been identified in others cell types using other experimental approaches.12,15 Moreover , addi-tional miR-210 predicted targets described elsewhere , 12,15,29 including the recently validated gene ISCU , 18 were also identified after relaxing the log2 ratio cutoff to 0.5 , comforting our methodological approach . It remains that the list of proposed miRNA targets always requires a direct validation by western blot analyses and or reporter plasmid assays . Functional annotations of the miR-210 overexpression experiments related miR-210 to �Mitochondria Dysfunction� , in line with the downregulation at mRNA level of several members of the complexes I and II of the ETC . We then focused on two components one subunit of ETC complex I , NDUFA4 , and one of the four subunits of complex II , SDHD . Our model indicates that miR-210-mediated downregulation of these ETC components could participate in mitochondrial dysfunction . Electron microscopy experiments strongly support this hypothesis Figures 4d and 5a , showing enlarged mitochondria with a modified organization of cristae in miR-210-expressing cells . These phenotypic modifications were associated with a decrease in the Dcm , consistent with our observation of an induction of apoptosis . Although the direct validation of these two targets was handicapped by the absence of specific antibodies against NDUFA4 and SDHD , we used three complementary approaches i 30UTR luciferase constructs ii western blotting of other subunits of these two complexes and iii the activity of the two complexes . Although a NDUFA4 30UTR luciferase construct displayed significant inhibition by miR-210 , we did not detect any effect of miR-210 at the protein level on other components nor on the activity of ETC complex I . This contrasted with SDHD , the fourth subunit of mitochondrial complex II , and also SDH of the TCA cycle , for which decreased expression and activity were noticed . It has been shown that mutations in SDH subunits including SDHD were linked with cancer and , in particular , lead to the development of paragangliomas or pheocromocytomas.30 A known consequence of the functional loss of any of these subunits is a great reduction of the enzymatic activity of the whole complex associated with an unusual mitochondria phenotype . Accordingly , SDHD inhibition mimicked several miR-210-mediated cellular effects , including alteration of mitochondrial ultrastructure Figure 5a , decrease of cell viability Figure 5b and activation of caspases Figure 5c . Our findings appear particularly interesting in the light of the report published during the preparation18 and revision24,31 of this paper , showing that miR-210 also targets the transcript coding for ISCU1 2 . ISCU1 2 facilitate the assembly of iron� sulfur clusters that are incorporated into enzymes involved in energy production , including mitochondrial respiratory com-plexes I , II and III . Chan et al.18 provided evidence that the lower levels of expression of ISCU1 2 mediated by miR-210 contribute to a decrease in the activity of the TCA cycle through aconitase targeting and the ETC through complex I destabilization . Further studies will be necessary to dissect the relative importance of ISCU1 2 and SDHD on miR-210 function , but it is already tempting to speculate that some synergy exists between both mechanisms . The regulation of these mitochondrial components by the miR-210 pathway appears to have contrasting consequences on the regulation of cell death and survival under normoxic or hypoxic conditions . Indeed , clonogenic assays performed in either condition revealed that although overexpression of miR-210 reduced clonogenic potential in normoxia , treatment with LNA-210 resulted in decreased clonogenic survival in hypoxia Figure 6b . These apparently contradictory results highlight the complex processes involved in the regulation of mitochondrial respiration and energy production in the hypoxic cell.32 On the basis of this model , miR-210 over-expression in normoxia would create a mitochondrial dysfunc-tion including a mismatch in electron transport that could lead notably to an increase in toxic reactive oxygen species as recently suggested24 and increased apoptosis as corrobo-rated by our data Figures 2d , 5b and c . In contrast , during hypoxia , the miR-210-dependent repression of the ETC via SDHD , NDUFA4 or ISCU1 2 and other validated or yet unknown targets would be protective by participating in the homeostatic downregulation of mitochondrial respiration . Notably , these effects can be recapitulated in clonogenic assays Figure 6b and are in agreement with similar data published during the revision of this paper.24 Overall , these data strongly suggest that although miR-210 exerts a maladaptive role in normoxia , its induction following hypoxia would , in contrast , be protective , as suggested by other studies.17,18,33 As the respiratory chain also serves as an intracellular O2 sensor , miR-210-mediated targeting of SDHD is likely to have direct functional consequences on HIF-1a activation . This molecular mechanism may have a role in the regulation of the phenomenon of increased glycolysis in tumors , known for decades as the �Warburg effect�.34 The link between the loss of mitochondrial tumor suppressors and pseudo-hypoxia was indicated by several studies showing that SDH subunit mutations were linked with HIF-1 activation in highly vascu-larized tumors such as paragangliomas and pheochromo-cytomas.35 Of note , microarray analysis of these SDH subunit-deficient tumors including SDHD revealed an HIF signature identical to that of a group of von Hippel-Lindau VHL -deficient tumors.28 The VHL tumor suppressor is a key mediator of HIF activity , mediating ubiquitination and sub-sequent proteasome-mediated degradation of HIF-1a follow-ing its hydroxylation by HIF prolyl hydroxylase domain proteins PHD1 , 2 or 3 in normoxia.36 Importantly , it has been shown that feedback inhibition of PHDs by succinate , a product of PHDs , leads to HIF-1a stabilization.37 Our findings showing that both miR-210 overexpression and SDHD silencing increase HRE luciferase activity are in perfect agreement with these data . Moreover , another level of interplay has been proposed in which HIF-1 is also able to downregulate components of the mitochondrial complex II.28 Our findings suggest that miR-210 could explain this observation and be part of an autoregulatory loop , whereby HIF-1 contributes to attenuation of SDHD levels , leading to complex II inhibition , accumulation of succinate and resulting in blockade of HIF-1a degradation Figure 7d . In agreement with this hypothesis , miR-210 inhibition reduced both the duration of HIF activation and lactate production in hypoxia Figure 7a�c . The precise impact of the miR-210 SDHD interaction in a hypoxic environment on HIF activity remains to be studied in detail , as well as its consequences on mitochondria ultrastructure , function and cell death . In conclusion , here we have identified SDHD as a direct target of miR-210 , thus revealing a positive-regulatory loop associating miR-210 and HIF-1a . Histological and functional evidences show that miR-210 exerts a major influence on mitochondrial function , cell survival and homeostasis . These data will now be further explored in light with other miR-210 targets to analyze its precise impact on hypoxia-related diseases including cancer . Clinical samples .

20885444	I Szabo* , 1 , ` M Soddemann2 , L Leanza1 , M Zoratti3 and E Gulbins* , 2 Mitochondria mediate apoptosis by releasing proapoptotic factors such as cytochrome c , apoptosis-inducing factor AIF , second mitochondria-derived activator of caspase Smac Diablo , HtrA2 , and endonucleases.1 The release of these factors is the direct consequence of the activation of proapoptotic proteins from the Bcl-2 family , in particular Bax and Bak . Various proteins in the Bcl-2 family are key positive or negative regulators of apoptosis . They share conserved regions called Bcl-2 homology domains BH1 , BH2 , and BH3 . Biochemical and subcellular fractionation studies localized the antiapoptotic members , such as Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL , at the outer mitochondrial membranes OMMs and at the endo-plasmic reticulum and nuclear membranes . Proapoptotic factors either reside at the OMM , as is true for Bak , or are cytosolic proteins in unstimulated cells , as is the case for Bax , Bid , and Bad . Although it is very well known that Bax and Bak are crucial for the induction of apoptosis in many systems , the molecular www.nature.com cdd details of Bax-mediated apoptotic events are still unclear see , e.g. , Antignani and Youle2 . A diversity of stimuli have been suggested as initiators of the activation of Bax and Bak , 3,4 including direct stimulation by BH3-only proteins such as Bid or Bim.5,6 Bax activation is believed to be a highly regulated , multistep process involving mitochondrial translocation and oligomerization , and this process ultimately leads to mito-chondrial dysfunction and apoptosis.7,8 Upon the induction of apoptosis , Bax migrates to the mitochondria , where it is integrated into the outer membrane as a monomer . Bax monomers then oligomerize and may form large pores in the OMM.8 In its inactive form , Bak is constitutively present in mitochondrial membranes and is released from inhibitory binding partners upon apoptotic stimulation . Bax and Bid , as well as Bcl-xL and Bcl-2 , form pores in synthetic lipid vesicles and membranes.9�12 . The ability of Bax to form ion-conducting pores in synthetic and mitochondrial membranes suggests that such pores are involved in the release of cytochrome c.13�15 Bax however might work as a twin-arginine translocation Tat -like protein rather than as an always-open ion-conducting pore in the OMM.2 Bcl-2-like proteins have also been shown to interact with some mitochondrial components . Evidence points to interactions between Bax and the machinery involved in mitochondrial fission and fusion see , e.g. , Youle and Karbowski16 and Scorrano17 . Bcl-xL interacts with the adenine nucleotide translocator , an important component of the permeability transition pore complex , and it has been proposed that this interaction prevents cell death.18 It has also been suggested that Bcl-2 as well as Bax interact with the voltage-dependent anion channel.19,20 We have recently shown that OMM-integrated Bax directly interacts with and inhibits an inner membrane-located mitochondrial potassium channel , Kv1.3,21 in lymphocytes.22 Kv1.3 has been shown to be expressed in different tissues and cell types , including brain , lymphocytes , macrophages , liver , and skeletal muscle.23 The absence of Kv1.3 in lymphocytes prevents Bax-induced release of cytochrome c , as well as changes in mitochondrial membrane potential and the production of reactive oxygen species ROS . In a previous study we showed that wild-type WT Bax inhibits Kv1.3 and induces the release of cytochrome c from isolated mitochondria , whereas Bax with a single-point mutation K128E does not induce this effect.22 According to a model of the structure of the membrane-integrated Bax monomer , at least amino acids 127 and 128 , located between the fifth and sixth helices of Bax , protrude from the OMM into the intermembrane space.8 We determined that Bax binds to the vestibule region of the channel via lysine 128 and preincubation of Bax with recombinant Kv1.3 prevents its proapoptotic effects in isolated mitochondria.24 The physiolo-gical relevance of Kv1.3 for apoptosis was illustrated by the facts that knockdown of Kv1.3 expression in human peripheral blood lymphocytes impaired apoptosis in these cells , and expression of mitochondria-targeted Kv1.3 was sufficient to sensitize apoptosis-resistant CTLL-2T lymphocytes , which lack Kv channels.22 In this study , we test the function of BaxK128E in a cell system and analyze the mechanism of Bax�Kv1.3 inter-actions using a mutant of Bcl-xL as a model . We report that mutation of lysine 128 in Bax to glutamate Glu Bax K128E abrogates the proapoptotic function of Bax in a cellular context . The critical role of lysine 128 in Bax for the induction of apoptosis is demonstrated by the finding that exchange of Glu158 of Bcl-xL corresponding to K128 in Bax with lysine converts Bcl-xL into a proapoptotic protein . Results Previous findings22 demonstrated that Bax requires lysine 128 to induce apoptotic events in isolated mitochondria . The mutation of lysine 128 in Bax prevents the release of cytochrome c and the depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane , events that were observed after the incubation of isolated mitochondria with WT Bax . These findings indicate that the highly conserved positively charged lysine of Bax plugs the pore of the mitochondrial potassium channel Kv1.3 , and thereby initiates mitochondrial changes during apoptosis . Antiapoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL in various species contain a negative charge in the position corresponding to that of K128 in Bax amino acid aa 158 for Bcl-xL Figure 1 . In these proteins , a conserved lysine arginine precedes this glutamate . Thus , whereas in proapoptotic Bcl-2-like proteins an isolated positive charge is found at aa 128 , in antiapoptotic Bcl-2-like proteins the positive charge at aa 157 is counter-balanced by a negative charge at position 158 , resulting in a net charge of zero in antiapoptotic proteins at this site . The absence of a net positive charge at this site is expected to prevent inhibition of Kv1.3 by the antiapoptotic Bcl-2-like proteins , even if they are in close contact with each other . On the basis of these considerations , and to gain insight into the mechanism of Kv1.3�Bax interaction , we replaced Glu158 in Bcl-xL with a lysine . Bcl-xLE158K caused a marked inhibition of Kv1.3 in patch-clamp experiments on Jurkat T lymphocytes Figure 2A , comparable to that caused by WT Bax Figure 2B IC50 of 5 nM for Bcl-xLE158K IC50 of 4 nM for WT Bax . In contrast , neither WT Bcl-xL nor mutant BaxK128E or GST altered Kv1.3 currents Figures 2C�E , and Szabo� et al.22 . Bax and margatoxin MgTx competed for the same binding site on Kv1.3 Figure 2F , further supporting a specific interaction of Bax with the pore region of Kv1.3 and the notion that proapoptotic Bcl-2-like proteins mimic the interactions of Kv1.3-inhibiting toxins.24 To show that mutant Bcl-xL induces changes in mitochon-dria similar to those induced by WT Bax , we incubated purified Jurkat mitochondria with recombinant GST-Bax lacking the C-terminal transmembrane domain and therefore able to insert into the membrane25 , GST-Bcl-xL , GST-Bcl-xLE158K , or GST as a control . Recombinant GST-Bax and full-length Bax induced very similar effects on isolated mitochondria.22 Recombinant GST-Bax triggers a hyperpolarization followed by a decrease of the potential of the inner mitochondrial membrane IMM Figure 3a . The electrochemical gradient for K ? predicts that K ? should enter the matrix through a potassium channel located in the IMM . If the influx of K ? becomes inhibited , hyperpolarization is expected . Depolar-ization , which followed hyperpolarization , was inhibited by cyclosporin A CSA and , thus , was probably mediated by the opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore PTP see Supplementary Material in Szabo � et al.22 . The transmembrane potential of Kv1.3-containing Jurkat mito-chondria was not altered by incubation with GST alone , GST-BaxK128E , 22 or GST-Bcl-xL Figure 3a . In contrast , marked hyperpolarization followed by depolarization was observed when mitochondria were treated with GST-Bcl-xLE158K Figure 3a . Likewise , the mutant GST-Bcl-xLE158K , similar to GST-Bax and truncated Bid tBid -preactivated full-length Figure 2 Effect of Bax and Bcl-xL mutants on Kv1.3 current .

Please note that BaxK128E was added in solution where it may have a conformation allowing its docking to the rim of the channel however , in the absence of the critical lysine residue that plugs the pore , inhibition does not take place .

Importantly , the proapoptotic effects of Bax and GST-Bcl-xLE158K were abrogated in mitochondria isolated from CTLL-2 pJK cells lacking Kv1.3 Figures 3b and c . This finding indicates that the Bcl-xLE158K , similar to Bax , exerts its action by regulating Kv1.3 activity in mitochondria isolated from CTLL-2 Kv1.3 cells . To test the function of the mutant Bcl2-family proteins in intact cells , we transfected mouse embryonic fibroblasts MEFs deficient for both Bax and Bak double knockout DKO MEFs with expression vectors for WT Bax , Bax K128E , or Bcl-xLE158K . Bax Bak-deficient cells are widely used for determining the effect of mutant Bcl-2 proteins in a cellular context and on isolated mitochondria see , e.g. , Nie et al.4 and Gavathiotis et al.5 . The transfection of DKO MEFs with WT Bax or Bcl-xLE158K restored apoptosis induced by staurosporine , etoposide , or sphingomyelinase , whereas transfection with BaxK128E failed to restore apoptosis in these cells Figures 4a�c . The cytochrome c release induced by staurosporine in Bax or mutant Bcl-xLE158K-expressing MEF DKO cells was inhibited by CSA Figure 4d , suggesting a possible involvement of the PTP in this experimental setup . To avoid a possible proapoptotic effect of protein over-expression per se , the stoichiometry of transfection was adjusted to yield amounts of protein close to those found in untransformed WT cells . The protein levels were determined in the transfected and stimulated cells by western blot and fluorescence-activated cell sorter FACS which permits us to determine the expression of Bax in the population also investigated for apoptosis and were similar to the levels of Bax endogenously expressed by WT MEFs Figures 4a and b . To confirm that Bax interacts with Kv1.3 via lysine 128 , we co-transfected Kv1.3 and BaxK128E or WT Bax into MEF DKO cells , induced apoptosis with staurosporine , lysed cells , and determined co-immunoprecipitation of the proteins . The results Figure 4e show that the BaxK128E mutant failed to bind Kv1.3 , whereas WT Bax and Kv1.3 interacted after induction of apoptosis . To exclude that the lack of proapoptotic effects of mutant BaxK128E in DKO MEFs Figure 4 and in CTLL-2 cells22 may be caused by alterations of the membrane-insertion capability and or of the pore-forming properties of Bax by the mutation , we addressed whether the Bcl-2-family proteins used in our studies can efficiently insert into mitochondria . Figure 5a illustrates that mutant recombinant Bax and Bcl-xL are able to insert into MEF DKO-isolated mitochondria as efficiently as the WT recombinant Bax and Bcl-xL , as assayed by alkaline extraction . Activation and oligomerization of Bax can be detected by analyzing resistance of Bax to trypsin.26 In particular , following these events , amino acids at the N-terminus of Bax become susceptible to trypsin digestion the rest of the protein is protected , giving rise to truncated Bax of 15 kDa . In our system , in mitochondria isolated from DKO MEF cells , the recombinant Bax WT and Bax mutant equally give rise to such a truncated form revealed using an antibody against aa 1�171 of Bax D21 , indicating that the mutated version of Bax is still able to form higher-order oligomers Discussion In this work we provide insights into the mechanisms of action of the proapoptotic Bcl-2-family protein Bax , namely the inhibition of mitochondrial Kv1.3 . We also show that an inactive mutant of Bax forms ion-conducting channels similar to those formed by WT Bax , a finding indicating that Bax does not exert its action during apoptosis merely by forming ion-conducting oligomers . The data obtained with Bcl-xLE158K are consistent with the model we recently proposed for the action of Bax.22 WT Bax inhibits Kv1.3 , a potassium-selective channel of the IMM , and exhibits actions similar to those exerted by margatoxin and charybdotoxin , which block the channel with high specificity.22 These toxins possess a crucial lysine that blocks the channel by binding to the ring of four aspartate residues of the channel vestibule . Position 128 in Bax , which folds out of the OMM after insertion , 8 corresponds to a highly conserved lysine . If lysine 128 were important for the proapoptotic action of Bax via inhibition of Kv1.3 , we expect that introducing a positive charge at the corresponding position in Bcl-xL turns this antiapoptotic protein into a blocker of Kv1.3 with proapoptotic effects . Our results confirm this hypothesis and show that the addition of Bcl-xLE158K to isolated mitochondria efficiently blocks Kv1.3 and induces hyperpolarization and the release of cytochrome c . DKO MEFs were used to verify the effect of these mutations in a cellular context . The fact that mutant Bcl-xLE158K inhibits Kv1.3 and is sufficient to restore cell death in cells lacking Bax and Bak strongly indicates that the crucial lysine residue mediates inhibition of the channel it may also be important for the physical interaction between Bax and Kv1.3 . A single amino acid residue seems to be sufficient to mediate strong protein�protein interactions as previously shown by the observation that , for instance , a point mutation of K27 in agitoxin reduces the affinity of the toxin for the KcsA K ? channel 130-fold . In agreement , data shown in Figure 4e indicate that BaxK128E does not interact with Kv1.3 . The existence of various potassium channels in the IMM of different tissues has been reported see , e.g. , Zoratti et al.27 and references therein . Mitochondrial potassium channels permit K ? transport into the mitochondrial matrix , regulating thus mitochondrial volume homeostasis , changes in mito-chondrial membrane potential , respiration , pH gradient , and synthesis of ROS.28 In various systems , open potassium channels seem to keep the PTP closed.29 Kv1.3 was recently found in mitochondria of prostate cancer and breast cancer cell lines PC3 and MCF-7,24 in hippocampal neurons , 30 and in astrocytes.29 The observation that the ring of negatively charged amino acids in the pore of potassium channels is structurally highly conserved in all voltage-gated potassium channels see , e.g. , Rauer et al.31 suggests that the action of Bax may not be limited to Kv1.3 . Mutations at K128 in Bax and at E158 in Bcl-xL have not been previously reported , but other point mutations have been shown to alter the activity of Bax and Bcl-xL . Recently , Gavathiotis et al.5 described a point mutation of Bax K21E that identifies a novel structural location of Bax activation . Cysteine 62 of Bax was shown to be critical for its conformational activation and proapoptotic activity in response to H2O2-induced apoptosis.4 These results , like ours , point to the importance of a single amino acid for protein� protein interaction and for the proapoptotic efficiency of Bax . Lysine 128 in Bax and the Glu158 in Bcl-xL are not located within the BH3 domain , making therefore unlikely that these amino acids are involved in the dimerization process of Bax or Bcl-xL . With regard to the possibility that Bax mutations may cause alterations in the release of cytochrome c , Heimlich et al.32 reported that the Bax-induced release of cytochrome c from mitochondria depends on a-helices 5 and 6 , a region comprising K128 . However , the effect of these deletions in intact cells has not been investigated . Regarding Bcl-xL , a G138A mutation abrogates the ability of Bcl-xL to dimerize with Bax and prevents the inhibition of cell death induced by deprivation of IL-3 or dexamethasone in the murine prolym-phocytic IL-3-dependent cell line F5.12.33 It should be noted that we mutated Bcl-xL to analyze the role of a critical lysine in Bax for the induction of apoptosis . Our studies demonstrate that a point mutation in Bcl-xL converts the protein into a proapoptotic protein , whereas the mutation of Bax at K128 prevents the induction of apoptosis by Bax . Thus , lysine 128 in Bax plays a crucial role in the induction of apoptosis in a cellular model . The findings further support the notion that Bax induces apoptosis via the direct inhibition of a mitochondrial potassium channel by plugging the pore with K128 . We would like to point out that we do not propose Bcl-xL to interact with Kv1.3 in vivo the Bcl-xL mutant was used as a tool to reinforce the evidence concerning the importance of the lysine residue in Bax . Recombinant Bax can directly insert into membranes with the a-helices 5 and 6 , and it can also spontaneously oligomerize see , e.g. , Antonsson et al.25 . In vitro experi-ments have shown that Bax oligomers are able to conduct cytochrome c.14,25,34 These findings , and the observation that some proteins from the Bcl-2 family form ion-conducting pores Figure 6 Kv1.3-dependent and -independent release of proapoptotic factors from mitochondria in CTLL-2 cells . Smac Diablo a and HtrA2 Omi b are released by GST-Bax and tBid independently of Kv1.3 expression . Mitochondria were isolated from CTLL pJK and CTLL Kv1.3 cells and were incubated with 5 nM GST or GST-Bax . Mitochondria were pelleted and the release of Smac Diablo and HtrA2 Omi into the supernatants was visualized by western blotting . Shown are representative results from at least three independent experiments . Purity of supernatants was controlled as in Figure 3d not shown . c CTLL-2 pJK and CTLL-2 Kv1.3 cells were left untreated c or treated with staurosporine ST and lysed . Mitochondria were separated from cytosolic fraction and both fractions were assayed for the release of cytochrome c , Smac , EndoG , and AIF . In the case of Smac , fractions obtained from cells incubated with cyclosporine A CSA and ST ST ? CSA were loaded . Purity of cytosolic fractions from the same experiment was tested using an antibody against the outer mitochondrial protein Tom20 upon reconstitution in artificial membranes , 10�13 suggest that cytochrome c may cross the OMM through an aqueous channel formed by assembled Bax monomers , Bak mono-mers , or hetero-oligomers of both proteins . Our findings do not contradict this hypothesis , but indicate that a Kv1.3-dependent event is necessary for the release of cytochrome c upon the interaction of Bax with mitochondria . Formation of Bax oligomers and pore formation by Bax in the OMM may well occur independently of Kv1.3 , as suggested by the release of Smac Diablo and HtrA2 Omi occurring indepen-dently of Kv1.3 . On the other hand , the Bax mutant is efficiently inserted and activated in mitochondria Figure 5 , and is able to form oligomers and ion channels and mediate the release of Smac Diablo and HtrA2 Omi Figures 5�7 yet , cytochrome c is not released with mutant Bax and cell death is impaired Figure 4 . The notion that Bax itself is not sufficient alone for mediating the efflux of cytochrome c from mitochon-dria has been also demonstrated by other investigations on the roles of cardiolipin35 and Opa-136 in controlling the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria . Similar to cytochrome c , the release of AIF and EndoG are Kv1.3 dependent Figure 6 . AIF and EndoG have been proposed to be released in a ROS-dependent way from mitochondria.37,38 Given that Kv1.3 inhibition by Bax leads to an increase in ROS release , 22 one possible explanation for our findings is that Kv1.3 is only involved in ROS-mediated mobilization release of proapopto-tic factors . Further work is required to prove this hypothesis . Bax and mutant Bcl-xL expressed in MEF DKOs induced a CSA-sensitive cytochrome c release , pointing to a possible involvement of PTP in this process , at least in our experi-mental setup . CSA may have additional effects in intact cells , and data by Schinzel et al.39 obtained in cyclophilin-D-less Bax and Bak containing MEFs argue against the involvement of PTP in staurosporine-induced apoptosis . Thus , the role of PTP in MEF death is controversial and further work is required to definitively exclude or prove its role . In summary , we demonstrate for the first time a single-point mutation in Bcl-xL that converts the protein into a proapoptotic protein , both in experiments with isolated mitochondria and in MEF cells . Our work addresses the mode of action of a single-point mutant of Bax in a cellular context , and shows that the Bax mutant loses its ability to mediate cell death . Further work is required to understand how general this feature of Bax action is and to further investigate the role of Kv channels and or other potassium channels in general in Bax-mediated apoptosis.40 Cell cultures . Jurkat lymphocytes and CTLL-2 cells were grown in RPMI-1640 supplemented with 10 % fetal calf serum , 10 mM HEPES pH 7.4 , 2 mM L-glutamine , 1 mM sodium pyruvate , 100 mM nonessential amino acids , 100 units ml penicillin , 100 mg ml streptomycin all from Life Technologies , Karlsruhe , Germany , and 50 mM b-mercaptoethanol . Mouse interleukin-2 IL-2 4 units ml Roche Diagnostics , Mannheim , Germany was added daily to CTLL-2 cells American Type Culture Collection ATCC , Manassas , VA , USA . DKO MEFs and control cells both kindly provided by L Scorrano were grown in Dulbecco�s modified Eagle�s medium DMEM Gibco , Milan , Italy supplemented as above without HEPES . If indicated , we added 2 mM CSA . Transfections . The lipofectamine technique was used as described by the supplier Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA , USA to co-transfect DKO MEFs with 2 mg 106 cells pJK Kv1.3 and 5 mg each of the expression vectors pcDNA-Bax , pJK-K128E Bax , or pJK-E158K Bcl-xL so that the MEFs would express WT Bax , K128E Bax , or E158 K Bcl-xL . Expression of Kv1.3 was confirmed by FACS analysis not shown . The pJK plasmid contains a single chain antibody with a Myc-Tag . The transfected MEF cells were sorted using anti-Myc-Tag antibodies and magnetic beads 36 h after transfection and then incubated for another 24 h . Alternatively , MEF cells were co-transfected with 2 mg pcDNA-EGFP-actin so that transfected cells could be detected or the cells were stained with FITC-coupled anti-Myc 9E10 antibodies to identify transfected cells for transfection with pJK-E158K Bcl-xL . Dead cells were removed after 12 h , and the cells were then cultured in DMEM supplemented as above for an additional 36 h and used for functional tests . For CTLL-2 cells we obtained stable clones by transfecting CTLL-2 cells with 40 mg 107 cells of pJK Kv1.3 or pJK plasmids by electroporation and culturing them with 800 mg ml G418 Sigma , Deisenhofen , Germany . All experiments except for selection of clones were performed with the bulk cell population . All cultures were re-established from frozen stocks after 4 weeks of growth . Cells were depleted of IL-2 before all experiments to avoid interference by signaling from the IL-2 receptor . To this end , cells were washed in 132 mM NaCl , 20 mM HEPES pH 7.4 , 5 mM KCl , 1 mM CaCl2 , 0.7 mM MgCl2 , and 0.8 mM MgSO4 H S and allowed to recover for 3 h in cell culture medium without IL-2 . Recombinant proteins . Bax amino acids 1�170 was cloned into pGEX-3X as GST fusion protein , expressed in BL21A1 , and purified from bacterial lysates using glutathione-sepharose . Bacteria were lysed in 50 ml of 25 mM HEPES pH 7.4 , 0.1 % SDS , 0.5 % sodium deoxycholate , 1 % Triton X-100 , 125 mM NaCl , 10 mM each NaF , Na3VO4 , and sodium pyrophosphate , 10 mM each aprotinin and leupeptin A L , and 1 mg ml lysozyme . Samples were incubated on ice for 15 min so that lysis could be completed , and DNA was degraded with 5 mg ml DNAaseI in 30 mM MgCl2 for 30 min . After insoluble material had been pelleted by a 50-min centrifugation at 11 000 g at 41C , the GST fusion proteins in the supernatant were immobilized by incubation with 300 ml glutathione sepharose GE Healthcare , Chalfont St. Giles , UK for 1 h at 41C . The beads were extensively washed so that any detergents could be eliminated and 20 mM glutathione was added to elute the fusion protein . Glutathione was removed by dialysis and the samples were concentrated to 1 ml by several centrifugation rounds through size-exclusion columns cutoff , 10 000 Da Viva Science Sartorius , Gottingen , � Germany . The K128E mutant of Bax and the E158K mutant of Bcl-xL were obtained by a site-directed mutagenesis PCR technique Stratagene , La Jolla , CA , USA , cloned into pGEX-3X , and expressed and purified as a GST fusion protein as above . In the present study we used a GST-DC-Bax , which lacks the C-terminal transmembrane domain and does not require activation by tBid , for insertion into the membrane and induction of cytochrome c release.25 Cellular apoptosis assays . To detect the release of mitochondrial cytochrome c and Smac , transfected MEF cells were either left untreated or treated with staurosporine for 12 h , washed in cold HEPES saline , incubated for 30 min at 41C in 0.3 M sucrose , 10 mM TES pH 7.4 , and 0.5 mM EGTA TES buffer and then Dounce-homogenized . Nuclei and unbroken cells were pelleted by centrifugation for 5 min at 600 g and 41C . Supernatants were centrifuged at 6000 g for 10 min at 41C . The supernatants were used to detect released cytochrome c or Smac Diablo , and the pellets were used to detect mitochondrial cytochrome c . Proteins were separated on 15 % SDS-PAGE , blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane , and developed with a monoclonal mouse anti-cytochrome c antibody clone 7H8.2C12 BD Biosciences Pharmingen , San Diego , CA , USA or with anti-Smac antibody and the Tropix ECL system Bedford , MA , USA . Morphological signs of apoptosis , such as DNA condensation , nuclear fragmentation , and blebbing , were detected by staining non-permeabilized cells with 4 mg ml propidium iodide and 4 mg ml ethidium bromide . This method also differentiated apoptotic and necrotic cells . To detect cytochrome c , AIF , Smac , Omi , and EndoG release in intact CTLL-2 cells , the cells were treated with 1 mM staurosporine with or without 2 mM CSA for 12 h . After incubation , the cells were collected , washed with phosphate-buffered saline PBS , re-suspended in 150 ml of TES buffer , and incubated on ice . Cells were broken with an electric homogenizer 60 s . Unbroken cells were separated by centrifugation at 600 g for 10 min at 41C . Mitochondria were separated from cytosol by centrifugation at 7000 g at 41C for 10 min . Mitochondria were re-suspended in TES buffer . Both cytosolic fraction and mitochondria were analyzed by western blot . Alkaline extraction and trypsin treatment . Mitochondria were isolated as described by Szabo ` et al.22 1 106 DKO MEFs cells sample were washed with PBS and centrifuged for 10 min at room temperature at 450 g . The cells were then re-suspended in 1.5 ml of TES Buffer and incubated in ice for 30 min . After 150 strokes with a glass teflon potter , intact cells were pelleted by centrifugation for 10 min at 41C at 600 g . Mitochondria were separated by centrifugation of the resulting supernatant at 6000 g for 10 min at 41C and washed in 500 ml of buffer 1 50 mM PIPES-KOH pH 7.4 , 50 mM KCl , 2 mM MgCl2 , 2 mM EGTA , 10 mg ml A L , 2 mM ATP , 10 mM phosphocreatine , 5 mM succinate , and 50 mg ml creatine kinase . Mitochondria were then incubated with GST-Bax , or GST-K128E Bax , or GST-Bcl-XL or GST-E158K Bcl-XL 20 nM each for 30 min on ice . Na2CO3 0.1 M final concentration was added and samples were incubated for further 30 min on ice . Mitochondrial fraction and supernatant were separated by centrifugation at 20 000 g for 10 min at 41C . To assess Bax activation oligomerization , isolated mitochondria were treated with trypsin 0.51 mg ml final concentration for 1.5 h at 301C . Reaction was stopped by addition of equal volume of buffer 1 containing twofold concentrated protease inhibitors . Mitochondrial fraction and supernatant were separated by centrifugation at 20 000 g for 10 min at 41C and the former was assayed for the presence of Bax by western blot , using N-20 antibody Santa Cruz , Santa Cruz , CA , USA produced against a peptide mapping the N-terminus of Bax or D21 antibody Santa Cruz against an epitope corresponding to amino acids 1�171 of Bax . Cytochrome c and Smac Diablo release from isolated mitochondria . Mitochondria obtained from 1 106 CTLL-2 or MEF cells were isolated as described above and were incubated for 30 min on ice in buffer 1 with 5 nM GST-Bax , or 5 nM K128E GST-Bax , or 5 nM GST , or 5 nM tBid , or 15 nM GST-Bcl-2 , or 15 nM GST-Bcl-xL , or 15 nM E158K GST-Bcl-xL , or 0.1 nM tBid ? 20 nM full-length Bax tBid and full length Bax were co-incubated for 15 min at 371C prior to addition to the mitochondria to achieve activation of Bax so that chimeric proteins could bind to mitochondria . The very low concentration of tBid is sufficient to activate full-length Bax in vitro , but too low to stimulate low amounts of Bax and Bak associating with the outer membrane of isolated mitochondria . The mitochondria were then pelleted and re-suspended in pre-warmed buffer 1 371C and incubated for 5 min . The reaction was terminated by the addition of one volume of ice-cold buffer 1 , centrifugation at 20 000 g at 41C . The supernatants were transferred into new tubes . Reducing SDS sample buffer was added to the supernatants and the pellets . The samples pellet and supernatant were analyzed for the release of cytochrome c or Smac Diablo by western blotting . described in Szabo ` et al.21 in Jurkat cells . Leak currents were not subtracted . The bath solution was composed of 150 mM NaCl , 5 mM KCl , 2.5 mM CaCl2 , 1 mM MgCl2 , and 10 mM HEPES pH 7.3 . The intracellular solution contained 134 mM KCl , 1 mM CaCl2 , 2 mM MgCl2 , 10 mM EGTA , and 10 mM HEPES pH 7.3 . Intracellular voltages are reported , and outward currents are plotted upwards . Membrane potential in isolated mitochondria . The membrane potential of isolated mitochondria was determined by incubating purified mitochondria from Jurkat cells with 5 nM GST-Bax , or 5 nM GST-BaxK128E , or 5 nM GST , or 5 nM tBid , or 15 nM GST-Bcl-xL , or 15 nM GST-Bcl-xL E158K in buffer 1 supplemented with 10 nM 3,3 0 -dihexyloxacarbocyanine iodide DioC6 3 , for 30 min at 41C . Mitochondria were then pelleted and re-suspended in pre-warmed buffer 2 containing 10 nM DioC6 3 , and the transmembrane potential Dcm was determined by flow cytometry . Hyperpolarization increases the accumulation of DioC6 3 in mitochondria , as indicated by a right shift of the fluorescence signal depolarization is indicated by a left shift . Complete depolarization of mitochondria was achieved by incubation with 1 mM carbonyl cyanide 3-chlorophenylhydrazone CCCP for 10 min at room temperature and served as a control for the integrity of the mitochondria . The experiments were repeated with the Dcm indicator tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester TMRE and yielded very similar results . Flow cytometry studies . To identify cell death in pJK-K158E Bax-transfected cells , the cells were stained with FITC-coupled anti-Myc9E10 antibodies to detect the Myc-epitope present on the single chain antibody , which is also encoded by the pJK vector . Death was detected by staining with Cy3-labelled Annexin . Samples were analyzed using FACS-Calibur Becton-Dickinson , Franklin Lakes , NJ , USA . Co-immunoprecipitation . For the co-immunoprecipitation experiments , transfected MEFs were stimulated with staurosporine , lysed in 4 % CHAPS , 5 mM MgCl2 , 137 mM KCl , 1 mM EDTA , 1 mM EGTA , 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0 , and 10 mg ml aprotinin and leupeptin , and Bax Bax K128E or Kv1.3 were immunoprecipitated from the lysates employing protein A G agarose . The immunoprecipitates were washed six times in the lysis buffer , separated by 7.5 or 12.5 % SDS-PAGE , blotted , and developed with anti-Kv1.3 or anti-Bax antibodies . An aliquot of the immunoprecipitates was blotted with the immunoprecipitating antibody to test for similar amounts of protein in all samples . Control immunoprecipitates were performed with isotype-matched irrelevant antibodies . Specificity of immunoprecipitations was proven with CTLL-pJK cells lacking Kv1.3 expression data not shown . Patch-clamp experiments . Whole-cell currents were recorded with an EPC 7 amplifier List , Darmstadt , Germany filter , 1 kHz sampling rate , 5 kHz , as Planar lipid bilayer . A Warner Instruments Hamden , CT , USA BC-525C electrophysiological planar bilayer apparatus was used . Bilayers with a capacity of approximately 150 to 200 pF were prepared by painting a decane chloroform solution of soybean asolectin Sigma , Milan , Italy , partially purified by precipitation with cold acetone from a chloroform solution , across a 250-mm hole in a polystyrene cuvette . The inside of the cuvette constituted the trans compartment . The standard experimental medium contained 100 or 150 mM KCl , 0.5 mM EGTA , and 8 mM HEPES pH 7.5 . After the planar membrane had formed , salt concentration gradients were produced by adding equal volumes of the standard medium in the trans compartment and a medium with the same composition except for a higher concentration of KCl in cis . The contents of both chambers were stirred by magnetic bars when necessary . Connections to the electrodes were provided by agar bridges . Protein was added to the cis side . Voltages reported are those of the cis chamber , and current is considered positive when carried by cations flowing from the cis compartment to the trans compartment . Output was recorded with a 10-KHz bandwidth on videotape using a Medical Systems New York , NY , USA PCM-2 interface . The data were later analyzed offline using the pCLAMP program set Molecular Devices , Sunnyvale , CA , USA . Acknowledgements .

Biochim Biophys Acta 2009 1787 351�363 . Figure 5b . In accordance , BaxK128E is able to induce the release of Smac Diablo from these mitochondria , similar to Bax WT , whereas the release of cytochrome c is impaired when using mutant Bax Figure 5c . Smac Diablo is released not only from isolated mitochondria using recombinant proteins , but also in MEF DKO cells transfected with mutant Bax Figure 5d see Figure 5e for purity control of cytosolic fraction . Importantly , the effects of recombinant GST-Bax and full-length Bax22 on isolated mitochondria and those of Bax expressed in MEF cells are the same Figures 3 and 4 . These results further indicate the ability of Bax and of BaxK128E to form oligomers in the outer membrane and to allow the exit of Smac Diablo , but also point to another event , that is , inhibition of Kv1.3 by Bax , necessary for the release of cytochrome c . This compulsory proapoptotic event does not take place with BaxK128E see Figure 4c , or in the absence of Kv1.3.22 The notion that interaction of Kv1.3 with Bax is important for the release of cytochrome c but not for the oligomerization of Bax , is further indicated in Figures 6a and b , where in isolated mitochondria , Smac Diablo and HtrA2 Omi release occurs independently of the presence of Kv1.3 upon incubation with recombinant Bax , suggesting that interaction of the channel with Bax is involved mainly in cytochrome c mobilization rather than in its translocation through the OMM . We tested proapoptotic factor release also in intact CTLL-2 pJK and CTLL-2 Kv1.3 cells challenged with staurosporine . In accor-dance with data of Figures 3 , and 6a and b , cytochrome c is released in a Kv1.3-dependent manner , whereas Smac release occurred also in the absence of the channel . The release of Smac was insensitive to CSA Figure 6c . In contrast , the release of AIF and endoG required expression of Kv1.3 and was absent in CTLL-2-pJK treated with stauros-porine Figure 6c . Finally , we tested whether recombinant Bax WT and BaxK128E may form channels by incorporating these proteins into planar lipid bilayer . The BaxK128E was able to insert into liposomes and oligomerize as assayed by crosslinking with disuccinimidyl suberate Figure 7a . Both WT and mutant Bax proteins formed channels in this system only when added at very high up to 16 nM WT n ? 28 mutant n ? 20 concentrations . Although the activities differed , the differ-ences were within the range of the variability displayed by Bax channels from one experiment to the other . Note in Figure 7b that the amplitude of the concentration gradient-driven current passing through the pores at zero applied voltage the condition believed to prevail at the OMM and the kinetic behavior current traces are similar for the WT and mutant channels . 
20885445	Breast cancer is the most common malignancy and the second-leading cause of cancer-related deaths in women in the United States . Despite extensive studies regarding breast cancer , much is still unknown about the biological mechanism by which a normal cell turns cancerous . One critical factor involved in this process is Bcl-2 , which is highly expressed in 40�80 % of breast cancer patients and is also common in other tumors.1 The conventional view of Bcl-2 as a proto-oncogene focused on its ability to prevent apoptosis that contributes to the elimination of cancerous cells.2 Apoptosis is tightly regulated by the interplay of the Bcl-2 family proteins characterized by the presence of up to four conserved �Bcl-2 homology� BH domains.2 Members of the Bcl-2 family are classified as either anti-apoptotic e.g . Bcl-2 or pro-apoptotic e.g . Bax and Bak , Bid .3 The anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins block apoptosis by sequestering pro-apoptotic ones from inducing apoptosis . Of particular relevance , the molecular surfaces of Bcl-2�s possess a BH3-binding groove , an extended hydrophobic cleft formed by the juxtaposition of the BH1�3 domains , which can accommodate the a-helical BH3 domain of the proapoptotic Bcl-2 mole-cules.4,5 Thus , the interactions between anti-and pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins regulate the balance of cells� life and death and determine the propensity of cells to succumb to apoptosis . Although intense efforts have focused on the anti-apoptotic role of Bcl-2 , recent evidence however , uncovered a critical role of Bcl-2 to concomitantly prevent autophagy.6,7 In contrast to the �self-destruct� apoptosis , autophagy �self-eating� involves the lysosome-dependent bulk degra-dation of cytoplasmic components , through a centrally important double-membrane-bound vesicle , the autophago-some . Formed within the cell , autophagosomes serve to surround , sequester , and finally , seal off extraneous cellular components from the rest of the inside of the cell . Autophago-somes subsequently fuse with lysosomes , having their sequestered contents degraded and the resulting macro-molecules recycled.8,9 Although initially recognized as a res-ponse to nutrient deprivation , autophagy is now implicated as being essential to a variety of cellular processes including stress adaptation , development , immunity , and protection against neurodegeneration and cancer.8,9 Bcl-2 suppresses autophagy by directly targeting Beclin1 , a component of the class III PI3K complex involved in the autophagosome formation.6,10 An allelic loss of beclin1 impairs autophagy and renders mammary cells tumor-prone , suggesting that defects in Beclin1-mediated autophagy are essential for malignant transformation.11,12 Although the precise mechanism governing Beclin1-mediated tumor sup-pression is still elusive , recent studies have demonstrated that autophagy defects in tumors cause accumulation of unwanted protein aggregates such as the p62 and ER chaperons , oxidative stress , and genome damage , all of which con-comitantly fuel tumor growth.13,14 It is within this context we postulate that the inhibition of the tumor suppressor Beclin1 by Bcl-2 may contribute to the oncogenic potential of Bcl-2 . In support of this view , it has been shown that when Beclin1 function is left unchecked by Bcl-2 , excessive levels of autophagy induce cell death in breast cancer cells.6 More-over , knocking down bcl-2 results in autophagic rather than apoptotic cell death in MCF7 cells , suggesting that an alternative and or additional mechanism involving autophagy may have a role in Bcl-2-mediated oncogenesis.15 Most notably , our recent study on a viral Bcl-2 vBcl-2 encoded by g-herpesvirus 68 g-HV68 clearly indicated that the inhibition of autophagy by the vBcl-2�Beclin1 interaction directly contributes to persistent infection , a prerequisite for the malignant transformation of infected cells.16 All these ob-servations raise the strong possibility that autophagy is tumor-suppressive and that Bcl-2-mediated blockade of autophagy may contribute to Bcl-2 oncogenicity . Structural analysis revealed that the interaction of Beclin1 with Bcl-2 is reminiscent of that of pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins , in that Beclin1 has a putative a-helical BH3 domain that allows it to dock into the hydrophobic groove of Bcl-2.7,17 As the BH3-binding groove of Bcl-2 is engaged by both pro-apoptotic and pro-autophagic molecules , mutations in the groove that block Beclin1 binding also eliminate binding to pro-apoptotic Bcl-2�s and vice versa thus far , further compli-cating efforts to genetically dissect the in vivo role of Bcl-2 in cancer . As such , the role of Bcl-2 antagonism of autophagy in tumor development remains ill defined and the underlying mechanism is unclear . In this study , we first used loss-of-function mutagenesis to identify functional domains that can differentiate between Bcl-2�s anti-autophagic binding and its anti-apoptotic interac-tion . Further , using an in vitro MCF7 breast cancer cell-culture model and an in vivo mouse xenograft model , we observed that a Bcl-2 mutant that no longer inhibits apoptosis but retains its anti-autophagy function promotes the tumorigenic proper-ties of MCF7 cells to a level similar to wild-type WT Bcl-2 . This effect was specifically due to the inhibition of autophagy and was dependent on having an intact Beclin1 binding . Our findings thus demonstrate an oncogenic role of Bcl-2-mediated autophagy inhibition in breast cancer . Unlike what was previously thought , that anti-apoptosis features promi-nently in the functions of Bcl-2 in vivo , our study suggests that the anti-autophagic property of Bcl-2 may be , at least in some contexts , eminently exploited in human cancer , thereby making it an attractive target for cancer therapy . Results Bcl-2 interacts with Beclin1 independently of its interaction with pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins . To probe the specific role of Bcl-2-mediated inhibition of autophagy in cancer , we first sought mutants able to differentiate the anti-autophagic function of Bcl-2 from its anti-apoptotic activity . To this end , we conducted a loss-of-function mutagenesis by creating Bcl-2 mutants containing deletions in its functionally conserved domain , including mutants deleted of the a1 helix residues 1�22 at the N-terminus Bcl-2Da1 , the BH2 domain Bcl-2DBH2 , and of a triple alanine substitution at the �WGR� signature motif of Trp144 , Gly145 , and Arg146 in the BH1 domain Bcl-2AAA Figure 1a . These mutants were then tested for their ability to associate with Beclin1 and Bax using co-immuno-precipitation co-IP . When coexpressed in 293T cells , Flag-tagged Bax efficiently co-immunoprecipitated with WT Bcl-2 , whereas the DBH2 and the AAA mutations abrogated Bax interaction Figure 1b . Unlike the other three BH domains , the a1 helix of the BH4 domain does not participate in the formation of the hydrophobic central core . However , the deletion of the a1 helix renders Bcl-2 unable to bind Bax Figure 1b . Similar data were obtained probing for endogenous Bax interaction with these Bcl-2 mutants Figure 1c . Likewise , the bacteria purified GST-fused Bak referred to as GST-BakDTM the TM domain was removed to increase its solubility in Escherichia coli readily pulled down WT , but not mutant Bcl-2�s in 293T Figure 1d . Collectively , these data indicate that the N-terminal a1 helix , in addition to the BH1 and BH2 domains , is essential for Bcl-2�s heterodimerization with Bax and Bak , consistent with previous reports.18 To determine whether the different Bcl-2 mutants preserve their binding with Beclin1 , 293T cells were transfected with the WT or mutant Bcl-2 together with Beclin1-V5 . We found that the DBH2 and AAA mutant Bcl-2�s that failed to bind Bax also failed to bind Beclin1 Figure 1e . Interestingly , Bcl-2Da1 that lost its ability to interact with Bax and Bak retained efficient Beclin1 binding similar to that of WT Figure 1e . Analogous results were obtained with endogenous Beclin1 Figure 1f . These data thus indicate that Bcl-2 forms a complex with Beclin1 independent of its interaction with the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins , and that the a1-helical region outside the core seems to contribute mainly to its anti-apoptotic binding . The a1 helix is required for the anti-apoptotic function of Bcl-2 . To determine whether the Bcl-2 mutants were competent in apoptotic inhibition , we established stable cell lines expressing equivalent levels of WT or mutant Bcl-2 Supplementary Figure S1a . As shown in Figure 2a , markedly increased cell death was observed with cells expressing vector or the Bcl-2 mutants as compared with that of WT . Apoptosis inhibition was further evaluated using propidium iodide staining to check for the sub-G1 accumulation of cells . Consistently , the Bcl-2 mutants unable to interact with Bax and Bak failed to suppress STS-induced apoptosis , whereas Bcl-2WT expression conferred over 90 % protection against apoptosis Figure 2b . In support of this , unlike WT , none of the Bcl-2 mutants could inhibit STS-elicited caspase-3 activation and cleavage as measured by flow cytometry Figure 2c and immunoblotting Supplementary Figure S1b , respectively . Similar results were observed with other apoptotic stimuli including etoposide , TNFa and cycloheximide data not shown . These data indicate that deletion of the a1 helix or any disturbance of the hydrophobic groove can severely impair the ability of Bcl-2 to suppress apoptosis . Thus , the a1 helix , which does not mediate Beclin1 interaction , is critical for the Bcl-2-mediated apoptosis antagonism , further supporting the existence of an anti-apoptosis-independent interaction between Bcl-2 and Beclin1 . Beclin1-dependent autophagy . As Bcl-2 lacking the a1 helix is unable to inhibit apoptosis , we sought to determine whether this region of Bcl-2 is equally or differentially required for Beclin1-dependent autophagy . We initially used NIH3T3 cells stably expressing Bcl-2�s as described above . Autophagy was evaluated using the fluorescent autophagosome marker , GFP-LC3 , which redistributes from Hydrophobic Pocket The anti-apoptosis defective Bcl-2Da1 mutant inhibits a diffuse cytosolic nuclear staining to a cytoplasmic punctate pattern upon autophagy stimulation.19 Consistent with its Beclin1-binding ability , Bcl-2Da1 inhibits rapamycin-and starvation-induced GFP-LC3 puncta as effectively as WT . In contrast , the DBH2 and AAA mutants showed almost no effect Figure 3a and Supplementary Figure S1c . To further validate this , we analyzed the lipidation of LC3 by immunoblotting . During autophagy , cytosolic LC3 LC3-I covalently conjugates to phosphatidylethanolamine to yield a lipidated form of LC3 and LC3-II , which displays a higher electrophoretic mobility and is indicative of autophagy.20 As seen in the GFP-LC3 puncta assay , the production of LC3-II was greatly reduced in the WT-and Da1-expressing cells compared with that in the DBH2-or AAA-expressing cells Figure 3b . To verify that the reduced levels of LC3-II DMSO represents decreased autophagy , rather than an accelerated degradation of LC3-II ? autophagosomes , we assayed LC3-II in the presence of bafilomycin A1 , under rapamycin conditions Figure 3b . Bafilomycin A1 is a specific inhi-bitor of vacuolar H ? -ATPase , which has been shown to cause accumulation of autophagosomes by blocking autophagosome�lysosome fusion.21 As expected , bafilo-mycin A1 elevated LC3-II levels in WT-and Da1-expressing cells , demonstrating that blockage of autophagy by Bcl-2WT and Bcl-2Da1 occurs at a stage of upstream autophagosome formation but not downstream autophagosome�lysosome fusion Figure 3b . The p62 degradation is also used to evaluate autophagic flux , 22 as p62 is a selective substrate of autophagy whose protein level is inversely related to the overall autophagic activity.22,23 Again , we found that the steady level of p62 was markedly upregulated in WT-and Da1-expressing cells compared with cells expressing vector , DBH2 or AAA Figure 3b . Rapamycin treatment led to an evident increase of p62 degradation , which was subsequently reversed by bafilomycin A1 Figure 3b . The inverse relationship between the reduced LC3-II levels and the increased p62 levels in the Bcl-2Da1 cells suggests that autophagic flux is attenuated by Bcl-2Da1 , similarly to what is seen with WT . Thus , the a1 helix of Bcl-2 , which is required for the anti-apoptotic function , is dispensable for Beclin1 binding and autophagy inhibition , suggesting that Bcl-2 can modulate autophagy through its interaction with Beclin1 in an anti-apoptosis-independent manner . Previous studies showed that beclin1 deficiency increases one�s propensity for breast cancer.11,24 We next assessed the effects of the Da1 and other Bcl-2 mutants on Beclin1-dependent autophagy in MCF7 cells . The MCF7 cells express undetectable levels of endogenous Beclin1 and are reluctant to induce autophagy upon starvation unless Beclin1 is overexpressed.11 Consistent with previous studies , the restoration of Beclin1 expression in MCF7 cells MCF7 . beclin1 led to a strong activation of autophagy upon rapamycin treatment Figure 3c . As seen in 3T3 cells , the expression of Bcl-2Da1 in MCF7.beclin1 cells inhibited Beclin1-mediated autophagy as effectively as WT with a significant reduction in the GFP-LC3 puncta and in the production of LC3-II Figure 3c and Supplementary Figure S2b . Similarly , treatment of the cells with bafilomycin A1 causes a significant accumulation of LC3-II Supplementary Figure S2b . A marked increase in the steady levels of p62 was also observed in cells expressing WT and Bcl-2Da1 , but not in cells expressing AAA mutant Supplementary Figure S2b . Although the levels of p62 in vector and AAA-expressing MCF7.beclin1 cells are decreased by rapamycin treatment , the decrease was readily suppressed in the WT and Bcl-2Da1 cells Supplementary Figure S2b . In contrast , the DBH2 and AAA mutants were defective in the inhibition of Beclin1-mediated autophagy , despite having a similar level of expression as that of WT Supplementary Figure S2a . Thus , the a1 helix is not essential for suppressing Beclin1-mediated autophagy nor for Beclin1 binding , reflecting a striking correlation between the ability of Bcl-2 to bind Beclin1 and its protection from Beclin1-mediated autophagy in both normal and cancerous cells . To further confirm that the Bcl-2Da1-mediated antagonism of autophagy is independent of its anti-apoptosis status , we subjected the MCF7.beclin1 cells expressing WT or the mutant Bcl-2 to STS treatment . Apoptosis was measured by TUNEL staining . Unlike WT , the Bcl-2Da1 mutant failed to protect cells from STS-induced apoptosis , as was also seen with Bcl-2DBH2 and Bcl-2AAA Supplementary Figure S2c . Taken together , these results clearly demonstrate that the deletion of the a1 helix in Bcl-2 that abolished apoptotic inhibition generally has little or no effect on Bcl-2 anti-autophagic activity . As summarized in Table 1 , Bcl-2-mediated antagonism of autophagy can be structurally and functionally separated from its previously defined anti-apoptosis function , allowing us to evaluate its functional contributions to tumorigenesis in vivo . The anti-apoptosis-defective but anti-autophagy-competent Bcl-2Da1 enhances the tumorigenic properties of breast cancer cells . Identification of the Bcl-2Da1 mutant allows us to examine the phenotypic consequence of the anti-autophagic aspect of Bcl-2 in cancer without being affected by its inherent anti-apoptotic role . To test the hypothesis that the Beclin1�Bcl-2 interaction has an important role in Bcl-2 oncogenicity , we used the MCF7.beclin1 cells , which were previously used to demonstrate the tumor suppressor function of Beclin1,11 Table 1 Summary of the anti-autophagic and anti-apoptotic activities of the Bcl-2 mutants Bcl-2 Beclin1 Bax Bak Anti-autophagy Anti-apoptosis WT + + + + Da1 + + AAA DBH2 and assessed the effect of WT Da1 and other mutant Bcl-2 proteins on the ability of Beclin1 to suppress cellular proliferation and transformation in MCF7 cells . As previously shown , 11 the restoration of Beclin1 effectively blocked the hyperproliferation of MCF7 cells Figure 4a . Surprisingly , the expression of Bcl-2Da1 , which antagonizes Beclin1 function , stimulated cell proliferation of MCF7.beclin1 cells to a similar degree to that of WT Bcl-2 . In contrast , Bcl-2DBH2 , which fails to bind Beclin1 , did not enhance the growth rate of MCF7.beclin1 cells Figure 4a . In-line with this , Bcl-2Da1-expressing cells formed more colonies then the control when plated at low density , and improved anchorage-independent growth in soft agar as efficiently as Bcl-2WT-expressing cells Figure 4b and c . In contrast , DBH2-and AAA-expressing cells were impaired in both regards Figure 4b and c , and data not shown . To further determine the effect of Bcl-2Da1 on tumor growth in vivo , we orthotopically injected the Bcl-2-expressing MCF7.beclin1 cells into the mammary fat pad of nude mice and monitored the mice for tumorigenesis . Consistent with previous findings , 11 restoring Beclin1 in MCF7 cells substan-tially inhibited tumor growth with tumor sizes eightfold smaller than the mean size of MCF7 control-derived tumors Figure 4d . Bcl-2Da1 accelerated tumor growth to a level similar to that observed in Bcl-2WT-expressing cells-inocu-lated mice , whereas Bcl-2AAA defective in anti-autophagy failed to do so Figure 4d . The tumor-promoting activity of Bcl-2Da1 is further illustrated by tumor incidence such as WT , more than 80 % of the mice injected with the Bcl-2Da1 cells developed tumors , whereas only 30 % of the mice injected with the vector-or AAA-expressing cells developed tumors Figure 4e . These data indicate that the expression of Bcl-2Da1 renders breast cancer cells growth advantage in a manner that is independent of apoptosis inactivation . To confirm that the observed activity of Bcl-2Da1 is not because of ectopic expression of Beclin1 in MCF7 cells , we assayed MDA-MB-231 cells with normal Beclin1 levels and high basal levels of autophagy , 25 stably transfected with WT or mutant Bcl-2 at equivalent levels Supplementary Figure S3 . Expression of Bcl-2Da1 considerably enhanced both low-density colony formation and growth of MDA-MB-231 cells as effectively as WT , whereas Bcl-2DBH2 and Bcl-2AAA had minimal effects Figure 5a and b . Accordingly , the tumori-genic properties of MDA-MB-231 cells were also enhanced by WT and Bcl-2Da1 in vivo Figure 5c . The mean tumor volume increased about sixfold in mice injected with MDA-MB-231.Bcl-2 and MDA-MB-231.Bcl-2Da1 cells compared with mice injected with MDA-MB-231 cells-expressing vector , DBH2 , or AAA mutant Figure 5c . These data indicate that the anti-apoptosis defective Bcl-2Da1 mutant , such as Bcl-2WT , improves the transformed growth of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells . Effect of Bcl-2Da1 on the transformation properties of breast cancer cells with low Beclin1 expression . To further address whether blockage of Beclin1 function is truly required for the oncogenic effects elicited by Bcl-2Da1 and WT in MCF7 cells , we examined MCF7 cells with a monoallelic deletion of beclin1 and thus express low or undetectable levels of endogenous Beclin1.11 In particular , we constructed MCF7 cell lines stably expressing WT or mutant Bcl-2 variants at similar levels Supplementary Figure S4c . Upon injection into mice , MCF7 cells expressing Bcl-2 gave rise to tumors that were three times larger than in controls , which is less significant compared with the 10-fold increase seen in their MCF7.beclin1 counterparts Supplementary Figure S4a and S4b . In-line with this , Bcl-2Da1 expression only modestly increased xenotransplanted tumor growth of MCF7 cells compared with the vector control , Bcl-2DBH2 , and Bcl-2AAA with no statistically significant difference observed in repeated experiments 3000 cellsn 10 colony 2000 1500 Number D12 50 40 field Mean 10 0 incidence Tumor * Supplementary Figure S4a . Hence , the enhanced transformation property derived from WT , and particularly the Da1 mutant , is severely blunted if Beclin1 expression is low . Of note , we also found that WT Bcl-2-mediated transformation was only partially abrogated by low Beclin1 levels when compared with Bcl-2Da1 Supplementary Figure S4 . This observation suggests that although Bcl-2 confers oncogenicity by targeting the Beclin1-autophagy protein , the full capacity of Bcl-2 to foster breast tumor growth may extend beyond its ability to inhibit Beclin1 other mecha-nisms may also be involved including apoptosis inhibition . These results reinforced observations made from an in vitro soft agar colony-forming assay . Unlike MCF7.Bcl-2WT cells , which formed colonies in soft agar with higher efficiency and of larger sizes , MCF7.Bcl-2Da1 cells were impaired in their clonigenicity in vitro , to a degree close to those observed in the AAA-and DBH2-expressing MCF7 cells Supplementary Figure S4b . Taken together , these results indicate that the inhibition of Beclin1 is necessary for Bcl-2Da1-facilitated transformation of breast cancer cells and that Beclin1-mediated autophagy serves as an important mechanism for preventing the deregulated growth of breast tumor cells , at least in certain contexts . Bcl-2Da1 suppresses autophagy in breast tumor xenografts in vivo . We next tested whether the enhanced tumor growth induced by Bcl-2Da1 , as shown in Figure 4d , is virtually associated with altered differentiation and autophagy in vivo . To address this question , WT-and mutant Bcl-2-expressing MCF7.beclin1 xenograft tumors were examined by histology and electron microscopy . The general morphology of the xenografts was similar , being primarily composed of poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma with irregular nuclei , periphery lymphoid infiltration , and frequent blood vessels Figure 6a . Notably , large areas of necrosis and multinucleated cells were evident in most of the WT and the Da1 tumor sections , but not in the vector control and AAA tumor sections Figure 6a . Consistent with their increased proliferation in vitro , the WT-and the Da1-expressing tumors had an approximately two-fold increase mean ? 60 in the number of mitotic figures per 10 high-power fields compared with the vector and the AAA tumors mean ? 24 Figure 5b . All Bcl-2-expressing tumors maintained a high level of Bcl-2 as detected by the anti-HA IHC staining Figure 6c , confirming the stability of ectopically expressed Bcl-2 in vivo . This data suggests that the impairment of autophagy by Bcl-2Da1 increases mitotic rate and proliferation in vivo and , thus , is preserved from Bcl-2WT in an antiapoptosis-defective background . To further evaluate whether Bcl-2Da1 reduces autophagy in breast cancer xenografts in vivo , the tumor tissue sections were subject to electron microscopy analysis . Our results show that the expression of Bcl-2Da1 and WT led to a marked reduction of the number of autophagic vacuoles in tumors Figure 6d . However , tumors expressing the anti-autophagy defective AAA mutant exhibited high levels of autophagy similar to the vector control . These data indicate that Bcl-2Da1 expression reduces autophagic activity that is associated with increased tumorigenesis in vivo . Accumulation of p62 and DNA damage in Bcl-2Da1 breast tumor xenografts . To further investigate how Bcl-2�s inhibition of autophagy affects tumor growth in vivo , tumors generated by Bcl-2-expressing breast cancer cells were examined for p62 accumulation , unfolded protein response UPR , and DNA damage activation , all of which are strongly associated with impaired autophagy in previous studies.14 As shown in Figure 7a , a marked increase of p62 was detected in Bcl-2Da1-expressing tumors as well as in that of Bcl-2WT , but not in tumors derived from Bcl-2AAA-expressing cells Figure 7a . Unlike previous studies that showed a concurrent increase of p62 and ER chaperons in autophagy-deficient tumors , 14 no evident difference in the levels of GRP78 , an ER chaperon and an early marker for UPR , was detected between Bcl-2 tumor xenografts Figure 7b . To investigate if Bcl-2Da1 inhibition of autophagy also results in enhanced DNA damage as observed with beclin1-deficient breast tumors , 14 the appearance of g-H2AX X 40 X 400 HA beclin1 MCF7 . 1 AAA N 1 AAA 1 AAA p62 GRP78 H2AX Caspase-9 PARP nuclear foci staining , an important marker for DNA damage , was monitored in xenograft samples . Our results indicate that the Bcl-2Da1 tumors exhibited increased g-H2AX foci staining reminiscent of that of WT , whereas only scattered g-H2AX staining was detected in the AAA mutant and vector tumors Figure 7c . Thus , these data imply that the autophagy attenuation and p62 accumulation due to Bcl-2Da1 overexpression renders breast cancer cells prone to increased DNA damage , which may contribute to their pro-proliferative state in breast cancer . To confirm that the increased p62 and g-H2AX staining associated with Bcl-2Da1 is due to the suppression of autophagy without preventing apoptosis , we evaluated the apoptosis status of xenograft tumors . Large regions of the cleaved caspase-9 immunoreactivity were detected in tumors expressing Bcl-2Da1 and Bcl-2AAA , whereas scant caspase-9 activation was found in WT Bcl-2 tumors Figure 7d . Furthermore , the cleavage of PARP , an event downstream of caspase activation and a biomarker of the end-stage of apoptosis , was frequent in the Da1 , AAA , and vector tumors by IHC staining , but was rarely encountered in the Bcl-2WT tumors Figure 7e . Taken together , our Bcl-2Da1 data indicate that the inhibition of Beclin1 and hence autophagy by Bcl-2 leads to the p62 accumulation and the activation of DNA damage responses , ultimately facilitating tumor growth in vivo independent from its role in antagonizing cellular apoptosis . Discussion Both apoptosis and autophagy are important tumor suppres-sor mechanisms.8 Although it has been well documented that apoptosis inhibition has an integral role in Bcl-2-mediated oncogenesis , the role of autophagy inhibition by Bcl-2 in cancer remains largely unknown . In this study , we demon-strated for the first time that Bcl-2 promotes tumor growth by an anti-apoptosis-independent mechanism that jeopardizes the autophagy pathway in MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells . Our finding thus indicates that Bcl-2-mediated inhibition of autophagy represents an important mechanism of oncogenesis . Previous studies have shown that mutations of Beclin1 that abolish its interaction with Bcl-2 confer a gain-of-function phenotype in autophagy induction , as was also seen with silencing bcl-2 in breast cancer cells.6,15 However , in these studies , the significance of autophagy inhibition by Bcl-2 in tumorigenesis is not yet known and delineating this is complicated by the fact that the two activities , anti-apoptosis and anti-autophagy , are intertwined and concomitantly propagated by Bcl-2 . Our discovery that an antiautophagy-competent but antiapoptosis-disabled Bcl-2 mutant promotes the tumorigenic properties of MCF7 breast cancer cells explicitly demonstrates that autophagy inhibition may have an equal , if not greater , impact on the ability of Bcl-2 to promote tumorigenesis and hence , should be merited as a novel mechanism by which Bcl-2 drives breast tumor growth . Bcl-2 is frequently implicated in cancers and is associated with the aggressive tumor phenotype.26 Our studies have allowed us to genetically dissect the specific contribution of autophagy regulation to the overall function of Bcl-2 by constructing a Bcl-2 mutant that is able to block autophagy but is unable to inhibit apoptosis in breast cancer cells . This mutant is highly competent in promoting tumor growth in Beclin1-expressing breast cancer cells , suggesting that the Bcl-2-mediated inhibition of apoptosis is not the sole mechanism that confers tumor development , but rather that the Bcl-2-mediated blockage of Beclin1-dependent auto-phagy also participates in oncogenesis at significant level . Moreover , when the level of Beclin1 is low or deficient in MCF7 cells , the ability of this mutant to improve the transformation properties of breast cancer cells is also significantly reduced , further suggesting the importance of Beclin1 antagonism in Bcl-2-associated oncogenesis . This finding seems to be without precedent as no clear evidence has ever been provided on the oncogenic importance of autophagy dysre-gulation by Bcl-2 . Our data , however , do not rule out an important role for apoptosis inhibition in tumor growth but , instead , it identifies a role of Bcl-2-associated autophagy defect in oncogenesis . It is also worth noting that most tumor cells including MCF7 breast cancer cells are refractory to apoptosis because of the inactivation of crucial apoptotic effectors such as caspase-3 in the case of MCF7 cells . Such an increased apoptotic threshold in tumor cells may benefit oncogenic transformation mediated by disabling autophagy . Analogous to Bcl-2 , other predominant oncogenes , such as mTOR , AKT , and FLIP , provide constitutive signals to suppress autophagy , whereas many known tumor suppres-sors , such as PTEN , TSC1 TSC2 , and p53 , have been found to activate it , strongly suggesting that interfering with autophagic signaling and machinery represents a common oncogenic transformation strategy in cancer.8,9,27 The data presented here indicates that autophagy inhibition is not a �passenger� function of Bcl-2 but rather predominant in Bcl-2-mediated oncogenesis . An important question that arises is why Bcl-2 possesses separate mechanisms for oncogenesis and how autophagy deregulation contributes to tumor development . Although impaired apoptosis is recog-nized as a key step in tumorigenesis , it has been shown that anti-apoptosis is insufficient on its own to fully transform cells and that full-fledged malignancy often requires the synergism of multiple oncogenic events such as enhanced proliferation , genome instability , deregulation of cell cycle control , and senescence.28 Given the substantial contributions of auto-phagy to the quality control of cells by the removal of damaged proteins and organelles , it is probably not surprising that a defect in autophagy can lead to the accumulation of undesirable components , which can fuel inflammation and induce chromosomal instability , as has been recently demon-strated in the autophagy-deficient tumors and immortalized cells.12�14 Consistent with this , we found that the Bcl-2Da1 mutant , which is sufficient to antagonize Beclin1-dependent autophagy , induces the p62 accumulation and increased DNA damage in breast cancer cell xenografts , whereas the Beclin1-binding deficient Bcl-2 mutant fails to do so . Thus , the Bcl-2 antagonism of autophagy can function indepen-dently to contribute to tumor growth , at least under certain conditions . In this scenario , the increase of Bcl-2 seen in most cancers may not only impart a survival advantage to these cells , but can also trigger oncogenic stress by compromising the quality control and metabolic equilibrium driven by autophagy . In summary , we have demonstrated an important role for Bcl-2 inhibition of autophagy in the transformation properties of MCF7 breast cancer cells . Beyond its established anti-apoptotic functions , Bcl-2 targets the autophagy effector , Beclin1 , and this activity subverts internal protein quality control and genome stability , promoting tumor cells growth . Our findings thus indicate that two tumor-suppressive path-ways , autophagy and apoptosis , both targeted by Bcl-2 , actually have distinctive roles in protecting against cancer . Future studies will aim to understand how these two functions are regulated in different cancer conditions , which may lead to new strategies for cancer therapy . Materials and Methods Cell culture . NIH3T3 , 293T , and MDA-MB231 cells were cultured in Dulbecco�s modified Eagle�s medium DMEM supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum , 2 mM L-glutamine , and 1 % penicillin�streptomycin Gibco-BRL , Carlsbad , CA , USA .

Constructs expressing the epitope-tagged Bax and Bak were kindly provided by J. Marie Hardwick John Hopkins University . The GST fusion protein of Bak GST-BakDTM from E. coli and the Beclin1-V5 plasmid have been described previously.16 All constructs were sequenced using an ABI PRISM 377 automatic DNA sequencer . Autophagy analyses . Quantitative GFP-LC3 light microscopy assay was performed in NIH3T3 and MCF7 stable cells expressing the WT or mutant forms of Bcl-2 , then transfected with a GFP-LC3-expressing plasmid.19 Autophagy was then induced by starvation or rapamycin treatment . For starvation , the cells were washed three times with PBS and incubated in Hank�s solution Invitrogen for 4 h at 371C .

Introduction The availability in recent years of newcellularandanimalmodels , as well as advances in genomic and related technologies , have made possible important advances in our understandingof thecellularand molecular events that mediate retinal ganglion cell RGC dysfunc-tion and death in glaucoma . Despite these advances , however , important questions still remain Morrison et al. , 2005 . Multiple hypotheses have been developed to explain how the major risk factor , elevated intraocular pressure IOP Boland and Quigley , 2007 , may initiate and or contribute to glaucomatous RGC loss Nickells , 1996 . These hypotheses include attenuation of neuro-trophin signaling Anderson and Hendrickson , 1974 Pease et al. , 2000 , neuroinflammation-related toxicity mediated through astrocyte and microglia activation and the cytotoxic effects of elab-orated cytokines Kreutzberg , 1996 Tanihara et al. , 1997 Yuan and Neufeld , 2001 , oligodendrocyte injury in the optic nerve Nakazawa et al. , 2006 , remodeling of optic nerve head OHN extracellular matrix Hernandez et al. , 1990 Morrison et al. , 1990 Quigley et al. , 1991a , b , glutamate excitotoxicity Martin et al. , 2002 Naskar et al. , 2000 Vorwerk et al. , 2000 , excessive nitric oxide NO and oxidative stress Neufeld , 1999 Neufeld et al. , 1997 , vasculature changes and associated ischemia Kaur et al. , 2008 , and autoimmune-mediated injury Waxetal. , 2001 , 2008 .

Zack . level , progress has been made to depict how the apoptotic pathways are activated by extrinsic factors such as tumor necrosis factor alpha TNFa Nakazawa et al. , 2006 Tezel , 2008 Tezel et al. , 2001 , and by intrinsic changes in subcellular organelles such as mitochondria fission Ju et al. , 2008a , b Ju et al. , 2009a , b , and by unbalanced alterations in signal transduction that may favor cell death . In this review , we will briefly summarize how genome-wide expression profiling technologies have been applied to the study of RGC loss in glaucoma , and will focus on studies of the retina and optic nerve head . As with many high throughput technologies , it should be understood that microarrays have both strengths and weaknesses , and that nuances between different array platforms , different study designs , theuseofdifferentanimalmodels , andvariationsinanalytical approaches can have profound effects on the results obtained . These factors likely account for much of the variation in results reported by different groups . In fact , given the significant differences in experi-mental approach between many of the groups studying experimental glaucoma , the degree of similarity between the various published studies is perhaps more remarkable than the many differences . Furthermore , it should be appreciated that transcriptome analysis of disease models is usually better at generating hypotheses than at proving mechanisms , and this is certainly the case in glaucoma . 2 . Neuroinflammation and glaucoma Among the IOP-based experimental glaucoma models that have been studied by microarray-based gene expression profiling are the DBA 2J mouse model Steele et al. , 2006 Panagis et al. , 2009 , the hypertonic saline injected rat model Ahmed et al. , 2004 Johnson et al. , 2007 Guo et al. , 2010 Wang et al. , 2010 , the limbal laser treated rat model Yang et al. , 2007 , and the monkey model Miyahara et al. , 2003 http links or GEO datasets are indicated in the References section . One of the prominent findings shared among manyof these studies is the upregulation of genes involved in the regulation of inflammatory and immune responses , such among them genes for a number of complement components C1qa , C1qb , C1qg , C1s , C1r , C3 , and C4 , a2-and b2-macroglobulin , LPS-induced TN factor Litaf , MHC class RT1-Aw2 , -Da , u-D-alpha , and -sb antigen , Interferon-induced transmembrane protein 1 Litp1 , and Chemokine ligand 2 CCL2 and 12 CEL12 MCP-5 . Retinal upregulation of complement factors C1q and C3 has also been demonstrated in the non-human primate model of glaucoma and in human glaucoma Stasi et al. , 2006 . It should be noted that changes in retinal expression of complement and related genes is not unique to glau-coma , having been observed in the relatively non-specific retinal scratch injury model Vazquez-Chona et al. , 2004 , and of course multiple genetic studies have implicated the complement cascade in age-related macular degeneration Anderson et al. , 2010 . Of addi-tional potential interest , and clinical relevance , in the DBA 2J mouse C1q is upregulated in the inner plexiform layer IPL and seemingly associated with progressive elimination of PSD-95-positive synaptic structures Stevens et al. , 2007 . These observations suggest that the activation of the classical complement pathway in glaucoma may contribute to the shrinkage of RGC dendritic field that has been reported in glaucoma Weber et al. , 1998 . Further supportinga role of inflammation-mediated mechanisms in RGC injury , tumor necrosis factor a TNFa Nakazawa et al. , 2006 and a2-macroglobulin Shi et al. , 2008 can both induce RGC death . In both human glaucoma and animal models , upregulation of TNFa expression has been documented in ONH astrocytes Miyahara et al. , 2003 Tezel et al. , 2001 Tezel and Wax , 2000 , and its receptor has been found to be upregulated in RGCs Tezel et al. , 2001 . These observations support the hypothesis that the TNFa pathway activa-tion may playan importantrolein mediating RGC deathin glaucoma . TNFa may induce RGC death directly by activation of the extrinsic apoptoticpathway . Morerecently , an indirectmechanism ofRGCloss in a mouse model of IOP elevationwas proposed . The data presented indicates that TNFR2 , but not TNFR1 , can mediate TNFa-induced microglia activation , and this in turn elicits a toxic effect on optic nerve oligodendrocytes , and subsequent delayed RGC degeneration Nakazawa et al. , 2006 . The observed upregulation of inflammation-related genes , such as those encoding cytokines , MHC class I and II molecules , andcomplementfactors , likely resultsfromthe activation of astrocytes and microglia within the retina and perhaps optic nerve.The activationofsuch cellsissometimes associatedwithaging and is commonly seen in neurodegenerative processes , such as Alzheimer�s disease , Parkinson�s disease , and amyloid lateral scle-rosis ALS Kreutzberg , 1996 Akiyama et al. , 2000 Henkel et al. , 2009 Johnson et al. , 2001 McGeer et al. , 2001 Saijo et al. , 2009 . Negative modulation of microglia activation has been suggested as an approach to decrease , and potentially prevent , further neuronal loss in neurodegenerative diseases , including glaucoma Bosco et al. , 2008 Levkovitch-Verbin et al. , 2006 Nakazawa et al. , 2006 Saijo et al. , 2009 Tanaka et al. , 2008 . Future studies will be important to assess whether the modulation of the inflammatory response can indeed provide a promising avenue for the development of novel glaucoma treatment strategies . 3 . Remodeling of the optic nerve head One of the characteristic changes in human glaucoma is exten-sive tissue remodeling at the optic nerve head ONH Quigley , 1993 Hernandez , 2000 . This process involves the proliferation of astrocyte and oligodendrocyte progenitors , microglia activation , and abnormal deposition of extracellular matrix ECM Hernandez et al. , 1990 Morrison et al. , 1990 Quigley et al. , 1991a , b . Together with loss of RGC axon fibers , these changes are responsible for the posterior cupping of the optic disc observed in glaucoma . Micro-array analysis of the ONH in the hypertonic saline-induced rat glaucoma model demonstrated molecular changes that may account for some of the tissue remodeling observed in glaucoma Johnson et al. , 2007 Kirwan et al. , 2009 . Cyclin D1 , encoding an allosteroic activator of cyclin-dependent kinase 4 CDK4 , was increased with moderate glaucoma , possibly reflecting increased cell division . There were extensive expression changes of several ECM components , including upregulation of collagens I , III , IV , V , and IV , fibronectin , cartilage-associated protein , and decorin and down - regulation of osteonectin and collagen XVIII . In addition , expression of several matrix proteases , including Matrix metalloproteinase-7 MMP7 , MMP2 , and ADAMTS-1 , were upregulated and TIMP-3 and -4 were downregulated . In an as yet unpublished study , Howell and John performed a genome-wide analysis of retinal and optic nerve head gene expression changes in the DBA 2J mouse model , exam-ining different stages based upon assessment of axonal damage , and using DBA 2J-Gpnmb ? mice , which do not develop glaucoma , as control personal communication . Among the gene groups implicated from the optic nerve analysis were �Extracellular MatrixeReceptor Interactions� and �Focal Adhesions , � suggesting that interactions between glia and vasculature may be an early event in glaucoma . The data from their array study is being assembled into an interactive database , the �Glaucoma Discovery Platform , � and it will be publicly available . Consistent with these in vivo findings , Hernandez and colleagues used microarrays to profile human astrocytes isolated from normal and glaucomatous ONHs and identified expression changes sug-gesting increased cell proliferation and TGFb pathway activation Hernandez et al. , 2002 . In another study , analysis of lamina cri-brosa cells from normal and POAG human donors revealed upre-gulation of ECM and pro-fibrotic genes , including transforming growth factor beta 1 TGFbeta1 , secreted acid protein cysteine rich SPARC , periostin POSTN , thrombospondin-1 THBS1 , cartilage linking protein-1 CRTL-1 , and collagen type I COL1A1 , collagen type V COL5A1 , and collagen type XI COL11A1 , and downregulation of fibulin 1 FBLN1 , decorin DCN , and collagen type XVIII COL18A1 . Together , these studies have provided important insights into the molecular mechanisms of ONH remodeling . 4 . Mechanisms of RGC injury and death Many studies have been directed toward understanding the cellular mechanisms of RGC injury and cell death , both in glaucoma models and following other forms of optic nerve injury such as axotomy and optic nerve crush . As a consequence of increased IOP , retrograde axonal transport , which is essential for transducing neurotrophic signals from activated TrkB receptors to the soma of RGCs , can be disrupted Quigley and Anderson , 1976 , 1977 Pease et al. , 2000 Howell et al. , 2007 . In rat optic nerve transection , acute and complete destruction of RGC axonal transport can trigger synchronized RGC death Quigley et al. , 1995 . Microarray studies comparing the temporal dynamics of gene expression changes following induction of laser-mediated rat glaucoma and optic nerve transection revealed both similarities and differences Piri et al. , 2006 Yang et al. , 2007 . Upregulation of genes reflecting astro-cyte and microglia activation , such as , GFAP , Ceruloplasmin Cp , Lipocalin 2 Lcn2 , and Hsp27 , etc. , was found in both models , consistent with the other studies cited above that indicate activa-tion of a mostly non-specific glial reaction similar to that which is seen in many forms of neural injury . In contrast , and of potential significance , upregulation of many of the other inflammatory genes seen in experimental glaucoma , such as those encoding comple-ment factors , was characteristically absent in the retina following optic nerve transection . A third group of genes showed expression changes that were significantly more prominent after axotomy as opposed to glaucoma . These genes were mostly downregulated , and included RGC-enriched genes such as Gamma-synuclein Sncg , Neurofilament light , intermediate , and heavy chains Nefl , Nef3 , Nefh , Peripherin1 Prph1 , Thy1 , Solute carrier family 17 member 6 protein Slc17A6 , and Neuritin1 Nrn1 , Cpg15 Farkas et al. , 2004 Ivanov et al. , 2006 Yang et al. , 2007 . Some of the observed down-regulation presumably reflects the actual loss of RGCs , but inter-estingly many of the genes showed marked decreases in expression before cell loss or damage was histologically evident , presumably indicating that RGCs initiate as part of their early injury response decreased expression of certain select genes . A hint into the mechanism underlying this early downregulation of select genes after axotomy may be found in the overlap of the identified genes to those reported to show decreased expression in the Pou4f2 Brn3b -null retina Mu et al. , 2004 , thus suggesting that Pou4f2 may participate in their regulation . Consistent with this hypothesis , in the adult retina , Pou4f2 expression is persistent in the majority of RGCs Badea et al. , 2009 Pan et al. , 2005 , and it is rapidly downregulated after axotomy Weishaupt et al. , 2005 Wyatt et al. , 1998 , Of potential therapeutic interest , neuro-trophins can stimulate increased expression of Class IV POU-domain factors in cultured neurons Wyatt et al. , 1998 . RGCs die by apoptosis in glaucoma and following other forms of optic nerve injury Garcia-Valenzuela et al. , 1994 Garcia-Valenzuela et al. , 1995 Quigley et al. , 1995 Qu et al. , 2010 . The extrinsic pathway , leading to the activation of executive caspases , can be triggered by TNFa and Fas ligand , whereas the intrinsic pathway receives activating inputs from a variety of molecular changes relevant to glaucoma , such as neurotrophin deficiency , glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity , calcineurin activation , and JNK pathway stimulation Grosskreutz et al. , 2005 Huang et al. , 2005b Kwong and Caprioli , 2006 Martin et al. , 2002 Morrison et al. , 2005 Pease et al. , 2000 . Experimental IOP elevation in the rat can activate caspase-8 and -9 , which are important initiators for the extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways , respectively Huang et al. , 2005a Kermer et al. , 2000 . Moreover , using laser-captured microdissection LCM , Huang and colleagues showed the mRNA level of both precaspases-8 and -9 were increased in RGCs by IOP elevation , suggesting that the apoptotic pathway is primed for activation at the transcriptional level Huang et al. , 2005a . The activation and crosstalk between extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways are regulated by Bcl2 proteins that can be subdivided into pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic groups . The interplay between the members in the two groups is mainly controlled by post-translational processes such as phosphorylation and inter-organ-elle translocation Youle and Strasser , 2008 . However , Bim , a BH3-only Bcl2 family member , is upregulated early after optic nerve axotomy McKernan and Cotter , 2007 Napankangas et al. , 2003 , and is suggested to be a downstream event of JNK activation . JNK is widely implicated in a variety of neurodegenerative disor-ders , and can be activated by a number of upstream signals such as glutamate excitotoxicity , oxidative stress , ischemia , TNFa , and axonal injury Borsello and Forloni , 2007 . Levels of phospho-JNK pJNK in RGCs are increased in both human and experimental glaucoma Kwong and Caprioli , 2006 Levkovitch-Verbin et al. , 2007 . Consis-tent with this notion of JNK activation , the upregulation of many signaling genes downstream to JNK , such as Jun , Junb , Fos , and Atf3 , as well as the increased phosphorylation and nuclear localization of Jun , have been demonstrated in experimental glaucoma Levkovitch - Verbin et al. , 2007 Yang et al. , 2007 . Thus , targeting the JNK pathway by blocking its activation mayofferan attractive therapeutic option for glaucoma treatment Bogoyevitch et al. , 2009 . It should be kept in mind that although , due to space limitations , this review has focused on gene expression changes associated with glaucoma and other RGC optic nerve injury models , a number of groups have also been using array technology to define the retina specific enriched-gene set and profiling expression changes asso-ciated with normal RGC development Ivanov et al. , 2006 Kim et al. , 2006 Moore et al. , 2009 . These studies have provided some important insights into the mechanisms that regulate the RGC transcriptome , and as we learn more about how perturbations of RGC gene expression affect cellular function , these studies may also help have implications for understanding glaucoma . In summary , gene expression profiling with various animal models has not �yet� explained all the mysteries of glaucoma , nor provided the magic cure . This may , in part , reflex the complex and multifactorial nature of glaucoma pathogenesis , and the multiple mechanisms that can lead to RGC death . Nonetheless , despite not providing all the answers , microarray studies in glaucoma have expanded our knowledge about possible mechanisms and path-ways , and pointed us in some novel directions .

For example , apoptotic cells release lysophosphatidylcholine , which favors the recruitment of professional phagocytes and the clearance of apoptotic cells.1 They also secrete lactoferrin as a means of promoting the migration of mononuclear leukocytes , while inhibiting the migration of polymorpho-nuclear leukocytes.2 Recent results suggest that this para-crine response also aims at fostering tissue remodeling and repair . A C-terminal fragment of perlecan LG3 , released as a consequence of cathepsin L translocation from apop-totic endothelial cells EC , induces Bcl-xl upregulation and resistance to apoptosis in fibroblasts , mesenchymal stem cells and smooth muscle cells , all of which are pivotal to tissue or vascular remodeling and repair.3�7 Recently , we showed that caspase-3 activation in EC favors the release of connective tissue growth factor CTGF , 8 which induces the differentiation of fibroblasts into myofibroblasts , a mandatory www.nature.com cdd of TCTP a novel pathway communication K Hamelin1 , I Londono3 , M Bendayan3 , AV Pshezhetsky2 process in all forms of repair . To date , caspase-3 activation has been implicated in the release of most , if not all , medi-ators secreted by apoptotic cells , 1,2,6,8 suggesting that the paracrine response is embedded within the effector phase of apoptosis . Dysregulation of apoptosis within cellular constituents of the vessel wall is pivotal to most forms of pathological vascular remodeling . Chronic transplant vasculopathy , systemic sclerosis and classical atherosclerosis are all characterized by the enhanced apoptosis of EC and decreased apoptosis of neointimal cells.9,10 Neointima formation develops initially through the acquisition of a synthetic and antiapoptotic phenotype in neointimal cells associated with extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 2 ERK 1 2 activation and Bcl-xl overexpression.11�13 Mediators produced by apoptotic EC , such as LG3 and CTGF , actively induce ERK 1 2-and or Bcl-xl-dependent antiapoptotic phenotypes in vascular smooth muscle cells VSMC , mesenchymal stem cells and myofibroblasts.3�8 This raises the possibility that a chronic increase in EC apoptosis , resulting in a sustained paracrine response , could contribute to maladaptive vascular repair . Here , we aim at further characterizing the molecular paracrine signals released by apoptotic EC , with a specific focus on proteins of importance in fostering a neointimal phenotype in VSMC . We used comparative and functional proteomics to identify novel antiapoptotic mediators released by apoptotic EC through caspase-dependent pathways . Results Serum starvation induces a pure apoptotic response in EC . To study the secretome of apoptotic EC , human umbilical vein endothelial cells HUVEC were rendered apoptotic in vitro by serum starvation SS for 4 h , as reported previously.3�8 In serum-starved EC , the percentage of cells with chromatin condensation in absence of cell membrane permeabilization increased over time , suggesting increased apoptosis Figure 1a . The absence of lactate dehydro-genase LDH release in serum-starved EC was also consistent with absence of cell membrane permeabilization Figure 1b . Loss of mitochondrial integrity was evident after 2 h of SS Figure 1c , with concomitant activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3 and poly ADP-ribose polymerase PARP cleavage Figure 1d and e . Preincubating EC with the pan-caspase inhibitor ZVAD-FMK or with inhibitors of caspase-3 and caspase-9 DEVD-FMK and LEHD-FMK , respectively before SS effectively blocked caspase s activation , PARP cleavage and chromatin condensation Figure 1d�g and Supplementary Figure S2a . Cell membrane permeabili-zation , suggestive of necrosis , was not significantly modulated by ZVAD-FMK , DEVD-FMK or LEHD-FMK compared with the vehicle dimethylsulfoxide , DMSO Figure 1g . Finally , as expected , pan-caspase inhibition in serum-starved EC did not prevent mitochondrial permeabilization Figure 1c and did not modulate p53 protein levels Figure 1h . Collectively , these results demonstrate a pure intrinsic apoptotic response in serum-starved EC . Characterization of the secretome of apoptotic EC . Serum-free media conditioned by apoptotic and non-apoptotic EC SSC-Apo and SSC-No-Apo , respectively were generated by exposing equal EC numbers to either vehicle DMSO or ZVAD-FMK for 2 h , followed by medium change and SS for 4 h , as described above and in Figure 2a . Proteins secreted by apoptotic EC downstream of caspase s activation were studied through comparison of equal amounts of proteins precipitated from equal volumes of conditioned media cleared of apoptotic blebs and confirmed by flow cytometric analysis Figure 2b . Proteins from SSC-Apo and SSC-No-Apo were analyzed comparatively , by either two-dimensional-liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry 2D-LC-MS MS Figure 2c or SDS-PAGE LC-MS MS14 Figure 2d . The latter revealed a distinct pattern of Coomassie blue protein staining in SSC-Apo compared with SSC-No-Apo . These results are in keeping with our previous work , describing increased protein secre-tion downstream of caspase s activation by apoptotic EC.6 Concomitantly , SSC-Apo was fractionated by fast protein liquid chromatography FPLC , and the antiapoptotic activity of each fraction was evaluated on VSMC.3 The protein mediators present in fractions with significant antiapoptotic activity were further characterized by SDS-PAGE LC-MS MS . To be considered a specific component of the apoptotic secretome , a protein identified by multifaceted screening had to meet the following criteria 1 it had to be identified by at least two out of the three different MS MS approaches , 2 it had to be found exclusively in SSC-Apo and 3 it had to be of human origin . Among the 27 proteins meeting the screening criteria Table 1 , only 11 had known secretion signals and 10 had been previously reported as components of exosomal nanovesicles Table 1 . To evaluate whether proteins known to be secreted through nanovesicles were overrepresented in SSC-Apo compared with SSC-No-Apo , the proteomics data were reanalyzed in search of classical nanovesicle exosome and exosome-like markers identified at least once by any proteomics strategies in either SSC-Apo or SSC-No-Apo . In addition to the proteins listed in Table 1 , twelve exosomal proteins were identified solely in SSC-Apo , including the two highly characteristic exosomal markers Alix and CD63 , 15 whereas only two exosomal proteins were found exclusively in SSC-No-Apo Table 2 . These results suggested increased release of nanovesicles by apoptotic EC downstream of caspase s activation . Caspase s activation in apoptotic EC fosters the release of antiapoptotic exosome-like nanovesicles . To deter - mine whether apoptosis specifically increases the release of nanovesicle biomarkers over other proteins , levels of Grp96 , an endoplasmic reticulum resident protein , and tubulin , a microtubule-associated protein , were evaluated in intra-cellular protein extracts and corresponding supernatants of serum-starved EC . Grp96 and tubulin intracellular protein levels were stable throughout SS Figure 3a . Grp96 and tubulin were not recovered in medium conditioned by serum-starved apoptotic EC Figure 3a , ruling out the possibility of unspecific protein leakage . These results are in keeping with the absence of cell membrane permeabilization in serum-starved EC Figure 1a and b . However , protein levels of tumor susceptibility gene 101 TSG 101 and translationally controlled tumor protein TCTP , two classical markers of exosomal nanovesicles , 15�18 increased over time in media conditioned by serum-starved EC Figure 3a . To specifically address the importance of caspase s activation in the production of exosomes or exosome-like nanovesicles by apoptotic EC , protein levels of the exosomal marker TCTP were compared in equal volumes of SSC-Apo and SSC-No-Apo conditioned by equal EC numbers Figure 3b and Supplementary Figure S2b and S3 . Elevated TCTP levels were evident in total unfractionated conditioned medium Total and in nanovesicle extracts Exo of SSC-Apo compared with SSC-No-Apo . Ponceau red staining confirmed augmented protein content in the nanovesicle fraction of SSC-Apo compared with SSC-No-Apo Figure 3b . In nanovesicle-free supernatant SN , the TCTP signal was recovered at similar levels in SSC-Apo and SSC-No-Apo Figure 3b . In SSC-Apo , TCTP was detectable at different molecular weights B23 , 50 and 75 kDa in media conditioned by serum-starved EC Figure 3a�c , in agreement with the SDS-PAGE LC-MS MS results where TCTP sequences were identified from two bands Figure 2d* . High-molecular-weight bands likely represent oligomeric forms of TCTP , as reported previously , 19,20 as the addition of a strong reducing agent TCEP to SSC-Apo before protein separation decreased the intensity of high-molecular-weight forms and increased the intensity of the 23-kDa band Figure 3c , middle and left panels . Also , electrophoresis of recombinant TCTP demonstrated the presence of high-molecular-weight bands Figure 3c , right panel , indicating dimerization . Of note , recombinant TCTP contains a GST tag , therefore , explaining the higher molecular weights of monomeric and oligomeric forms . Known sequences of importance in TCTP oligomeri-zation19 were present within recombinant TCTP . Collectively , these results confirmed that caspase s activation in EC enhances the secretion of the nanovesicle marker TCTP . To confirm the increased release of nanovesicles by apoptotic EC , ultrastructural studies were performed on nanovesicle fractions isolated from SSC-Apo Figure 3d . Immunogold labeling revealed the presence of TCTP Exosome-like nanovesicles released by apoptotic EC have an antiapoptotic function . We then evaluated whether exosome-like nanovesicles participate in the anti-apoptotic activity of the endothelial apoptotic secretome . Equal volumes of SSC-Apo and SSC-No-Apo were ultracentrifuged , supernatants were collected and exosomal on nanovesicles of 30�100 nm released by apoptotic EC Figure 3d and within multivesicular bodies MVB in apoptotic EC Supplementary Figure S1a . Morphometric quantification of MVB-like structures in apoptotic and non-apoptotic EC demonstrated a 7-fold increase in the volume density of MVB-like structures within apoptotic EC Supple-mentary Figure S1b . These data suggested that TCTP-bearing nanovesicles produced by apoptotic EC originated , at least in part , from MVB , consistent with the classical pathways of exosomal nanovesicle formation . pellets were resuspended in the initial volume of serum-free medium . Total unfractionated SSC-Apo and the corres-ponding supernatant and exosomal fraction significantly inhibited VSMC apoptosis compared with an equal volume of SSC-No-Apo Figure 3e and Supplementary Figure S1c . We also considered the possibility that exosome-like nanovesicles produced by apoptotic EC represent unusually small apoptotic blebs . In that event , the functional activity of apoptotic blebs and exosome-like nanovesicles should be similar . Apoptotic blebs were purified by centrifugation from SSC-Apo , and depletion was confirmed by flow cytometry Figure 2b . VSMC exposed to unfractionated SSC-Apo Total or to nanovesicle fractions resuspended in the initial volume of serum-free medium mounted a significant antiapoptotic response as compared with SSC-No-Apo Figure 3e . However , VSMC exposed to apoptotic blebs resuspended in the initial volume of serum-free medium failed to develop an antiapoptotic response , whereas VSMC exposed to SSC-Apo depleted of apoptotic blebs did so Figure 3f . Also , TCTP and TSG 101 levels were undetect-able in apoptotic blebs isolated from SSC-Apo , whereas both markers were enriched in the nanovesicle fraction Figure 3g . These results confirmed that apoptotic blebs and exosome-like nanovesicles produced by apoptotic EC represent two distinct entities , with different protein composition and function . TCTP is a novel antiapoptotic component of the apoptotic secretome . We then sought to identify specific protein s involved in the antiapoptotic activity of exosome-like nanovesicles released by apoptotic EC . Three proteins known to be secreted through nanovesicles were identified concomitantly through functional antiapoptotic and compa-rative proteomics strategies Table 1 . Among these , TCTP appeared to be the most likely antiapoptotic candidate as it has known antiapoptotic activity in a number of cell types . Small interfering RNAs siRNAs were used to silence TCTP expression in EC , with the aim of reducing the release of TCTP-bearing nanovesicles by apoptotic EC . TCTP silencing reduced intracellular TCTP levels and inhibited TCTP release in nanovesicle extracts Figure 4a and Supplementary Figure S3 but did not modulate the apoptosis of serum-starved EC Figure 4b . TCTP-silenced EC or control EC were employed to condition equal volumes of serum-free media . Unfractionated SSC-Apo generated by Exosomal proteins identified exclusively in SSC-Apo Exosomal proteins identified exclusively in SSC-No-Apo TCTP-silenced EC SSC siRNA TCTP or its corresponding nanovesicle fraction failed to inhibit VSMC apoptosis , whereas control SSC-Apo SSC siRNA Ctrl or its corres-ponding nanovesicle fraction did so Figure 4c . There was , however , no difference in the antiapoptotic activity of nanovesicle-free supernatants conditioned by serum-starved , TCTP-silenced and control EC Figure 4c . As ERK 1 2 activation is a characteristic feature of the antiapoptotic phenotype of neointimal cells , we evaluated whether TCTP induced ERK 1 2-dependent antiapoptotic pathways in VSMC . VSMC exposed to medium conditioned by siRNA TCTP unfractionated and exosomal fraction showed reduced ERK 1 2 phosphorylation in comparison with their respective controls SSC siRNA Ctrl Figure 4c , lower panel . ERK 1 2 phosphorylation was similar in VSMC exposed to supernatants derived from media conditioned by TCTP-silenced or control EC . In addition , serum-starved VSMC exposed to recombinant TCTP which included peptides identified by in-gel LC-MS MS , Supplementary Figure S1d manifested dose-dependent inhibition of apopto-sis Figure 4d in association with increased ERK 1 2 activation Figure 4e . The concentration of TCTP released by apoptotic EC in SSC-Apo was within the bioactive range Supplementary Figure S1e . Inhibition of ERK 1 2 activation in VSMC with PD98059 blocked the antiapoptotic activity of recombinant TCTP Figure 4f . Collectively , these results establish the importance of TCTP in the activation of an ERK 1 2-dependent antiapoptotic response in VSMC . Increased TCTP export is characteristic of apoptotic cell death . To evaluate whether TCTP release by apoptotic cells was specific to EC , VSMC were serum starved in the presence of ZVAD-FMK or vehicle DMSO . SS induced an apoptotic response in VSMC , which was blocked in the presence of ZVAD-FMK Supplementary Figure S1f . Elevated TCTP levels were found in medium conditioned by apoptotic VSMC , compared with an equal volume of medium conditioned in the presence of ZVAD-FMK Supple-mentary Information Figure S1f , lower panel . These data suggest that caspase activation favors TCTP export in different cell types . As nutrient deprivation is a potent autophagic stimulus , we also considered the possibility that autophagy could contribute to TCTP export . EC exposed to rapamycin , a specific inhibitor of mammalian target of rapamycin , showed characteristic autophagic features as evaluated by acridine orange staining Figure 5a , LC3 processing and electron microscopy Figure 5c in absence of apoptotic features as evaluated with HO-PI staining Figure 5a and PARP cleavage Figure 5b . EC exposed to rapamycin failed to increase TCTP release Figure 5d . Treatment with mito-mycin C MMC , another proapoptotic stimulus , increased the percentage of cells with chromatin condensation Figure 5a , PARP cleavage Figure 5b and TCTP release Figure 5d and Supplementary Figure S3 . These results point to the activation of specific apoptosis-associated caspase s as a novel pathway regulating TCTP export . Activated caspase-3 is a novel regulator of TCTP export . In serum-starved EC , TCTP export is initiated Figure 6a concomitantly with caspase-3 activation Figure 1d . Biochemical pan-caspase inhibition or specific caspase-3 inhibition in serum-starved EC preincubation with ZVAD-FMK or DEVD-FMK , respectively concomitantly inhibited EC apoptosis Figure 1g and the release of antiapoptotic mediators active on VSMC Figure 6b . In addition , TCTP levels were reduced in nanovesicle extracts from medium conditioned by serum-starved EC preincubated with DEVD-FMK , an irreversible caspase-3 inhibitor , compared with medium conditioned by apoptotic serum-starved EC Figure 6c and Supplementary Figure S3 . To further address the importance of caspase-3 activation in TCTP export and potential off-target effects of biochemical caspase inhibitors , siRNAs were used to silence caspase-3 expression in EC . Caspase-3 silencing significantly inhibited the apoptosis of serum-starved EC compared with EC transfected with control siRNAs Figure 6d and e . In turn , VSMC exposed to medium conditioned by caspase-3-silenced EC SSC siRNA C3 failed to mount an antiapoptotic response , whereas VSMC exposed to medium conditioned by control apoptotic EC SSC siRNA Ctrl developed an antiapoptotic phenotype Figure 6f . TCTP levels were lower in unfractionated conditioned medium Total and in the nanovesicle fraction Exo of medium conditioned by caspase-3-silenced EC SSC siRNA C3 compared with control apoptotic EC SSC siRNA Ctrl Figure 6g and Supplementary Figure S3 . Finally , we evaluated whether activated caspase-3 could directly cleave TCTP . Recombi-nant caspase-3 did not show any proteolytic activity toward recombinant TCTP in vitro but did cleave its known substrate PARP Figure 6h . Also , total and nanovesicle fractions of SSC-Apo failed to show bands lower than the expected 23 kDa , ruling out a contribution of TCTP proteolysis . Collec-tively , these results demonstrate a key role for caspase-3 activation in the release of TCTP by apoptotic EC . Discussion Apoptotic cells actively release a finely regulated set of �come and eat-me� and �stay-away� paracrine signals aimed at coordinating the specific recruitment of mononuclear phago-cytes.1,2 Recent evidence indicates that the paracrine component of the apoptotic program is not limited to the regulation of leukocyte trafficking but also aims at preparing the local microenvironment for remodeling after cell deletion . The present work lends further support to this contention . Taking a multifaceted proteomics approach , we identified a set of 27 proteins released specifically by apoptotic EC characterized by increased chromatin condensation and exclusion of propidium iodide PI , loss of mitochondrial integrity and evidence of activated caspase-9 and -3 down-stream of caspase activation . Several lines of evidence demonstrated that these proteins are not released as a consequence of cell membrane permeabilization . First , plasma membrane rupture , as evidenced by PI staining , is absent in serum-starved EC , and caspase inhibition does not impact cell membrane permeability . Second , LDH , a classical marker of cell membrane permeabilization , is not increased in medium conditioned by serum-starved apoptotic EC . Finally , the release of proteins by serum-starved EC is a targeted response , as Grp96 and tubulin are not secreted throughout SS , whereas TSG 101 and TCTP are released concomitantly with caspase activation . Non-classical protein secretion pathways are , at least in part , responsible for the paracrine component of the apoptotic program in EC . Among the 27 proteins identified specifically in medium conditioned by apoptotic EC , more than half did not contain a secretion signal sequence . Also , irrespective of the presence of a secretion signal , more than a third corre-sponded to typical nanovesicle components . In recent years , the characterization of different types of microparticles and nanovesicles released by live cells has been under intense investigation . Unfortunately , there is yet no widely-accepted classification of the various categories of micro-and nano-vesicles . Size , appearance under electron microscopy and intracellular origin are currently key features that differentiate various types of membrane vesicles . Exosomes are small , cup-shaped vesicles of 50�100 nm diameter.15,21�23 Their precursors are intracellular vesicles packaged into MVB , which fuse with the plasma membrane , releasing exosomal vesicles into the extracellular milieu.15,21�23 Exosome-like nanovesicles are somewhat smaller 20�50 nm , of irregular shape and probably stem also from endosomal compart-ments.15 Apoptotic blebs are bigger 50�500 nm , of hetero - genous shapes and result from budding of the cell membrane.15,24 The nanovesicles released by apoptotic EC share many characteristics with exosome-like nanovesicles and exosomes . Immunoblotting confirmed elevated levels of the exosomal markers , TCTP and TSG 101 in medium conditioned by apoptotic EC . Irregular-shaped nanovesicles of sizes within the range described for exosome-like nano-vesicles were demonstrated by electron microscopy in medium conditioned by apoptotic EC . Immunogold labeling confirmed that TCTP was present at the surface of these nanovesicles and within MVB of apoptotic EC . We , nonetheless , considered the possibility that nano-vesicles released by apoptotic EC could represent small apoptotic blebs . Several lines of evidence suggest that TCTP-expressing nanovesicles differ from apoptotic blebs . First , TCTP and TSG 101 levels are high in nanovesicle fractions but undetectable in apoptotic bleb extracts . Second , histones , previously described as a specific component of apoptotic blebs15,21 were not recovered with any of our proteomics strategies data not shown , further confirming optimal depletion of apoptotic blebs before MS MS analysis . Finally , exosome-like nanovesicles purified from medium conditioned by apoptotic EC trigger an antiapoptotic pheno-type in VSMC , whereas apoptotic blebs purified from the same medium do not . These results indicate that over the course of apoptosis at least two functionally different types of vesicles are released apoptotic blebs and nanovesicles . Whether the latter correspond to the enhanced production of exosome-like nanovesicles normally released by live EC or to a different nanovesicle type specific to the apoptotic program , sharing a common intracellular origin and at least some markers with exosome and exosome-like nanovesicles , will be the scope of future investigation . Our work identifies activated caspase-3 as a novel regulator of TCTP export through the nanovesicle pathway . p53 is known to regulate TSAP-6 activity , which , in turn , controls exosome production and TCTP release.16�18 Here , increased release of nanovesicle constituents was identified by an unbiased proteomics strategy , where media conditioned by caspase-activated or -inactivated EC were compared . Caspase s inhibition with ZVAD-FMK impacts the execution phase of apoptosis but does not alter molecular events associated with apoptosis initiation , which includes similar intracellular p53 levels and mitochondrial permeabilization . Hence , p53 can not be inferred as a regulator of TCTP export in our system . Caspase-3 biochemical inhibition or genetic silencing similarly prevents TCTP export , pointing to a pivotal role for caspase-3 in the release of TCTP-bearing nano-vesicles by apoptotic cells . Several lines of evidence indicate that TCTP plays a functional role in the antiapoptotic activity of nanovesicles released by apoptotic EC . VSMC exposed to TCTP-expres-sing nanovesicles show increased resistance to apoptosis and activation of ERK 1 2 , therefore , recapitulating a neointimal phenotype.3,9 TCTP silencing in EC blocks TCTP release and largely decreases both ERK 1 2 activation and resistance to apoptosis in VSMC exposed to nanovesicles produced by apoptotic EC . Finally , recombinant TCTP increases ERK 1 2 activation and inhibits VSMC apoptosis . TCTP is an evolutionarily conserved protein of crucial importance during development25 and for intracellular apop-tosis inhibition.26,27 The present work demonstrates that TCTP also displays significant extracellular antiapoptotic activity . These results are in keeping with recent investi-gations indicating that extracellular TCTP activates ERK 1 2 in basophils . The present study highlights novel mechanisms of cross talk between dying cells and the local microenvironment . Apoptotic cells actively release apoptotic blebs and exosome-like nanovesicles . The latter , through an antiapoptotic activity on cells of importance in tissue and vascular repair , likely favor remodeling at sites of apoptotic cell deletion . However , a chronic increase in apoptosis could foster sustained acti-vation of the paracrine program , resulting in maladaptive remodeling . Materials and Methods Cell culture and generation of conditioned media . HUVEC Clonetics , San Diego , CA , USA were grown in microvascular EC medium Clonetics and used at passages 2�5 . WI-38 human fibroblasts ATCC , Rockville , MD , USA were grown in FBM Cambrex , Walkersville , MD , USA with 10 % inactivated FBS Medicorp , Montreal , � Qc , Canada and employed at passages 2� 17 .

Then , the culture medium was changed for serum-free medium RPMI Gibco , Burlington , Ontario , Canada and EC were serum starved for 4 h . Characterization of the secretome produced by apoptotic EC . We adopted two comparative proteomics approaches to identify the secretome released by apoptotic EC 2D-LC-MS MS and SDS-PAGE LC-MS MS.14 Serum-free media 0.16 ml cm2 conditioned by apoptotic SSC-Apo and non-apoptotic EC preincubated with ZVAD-FMK SSC-No-Apo were centrifuged sequentially at 1200 g and 50 000 g to eliminate cell debris and apoptotic blebs , and depletion was confirmed by flow cytometry FACScan equipped with CellFit software , Becton-Dickinson , San Jose , � CA , USA in FL1 and FL2 channels . We also performed a functional analysis of SSC-Apo . A total of 750 ml of medium conditioned by apoptotic EC was fractionated by FPLC , and each fraction was tested for antiapoptotic activity on VSMC.3 The antiapoptotic fraction was resolved by SDS-PAGE , and the bands were sequenced with LC-MS MS . For 2D-LC-MS MS analysis , 40 ml of conditioned media cleared of cell debris and apoptotic blebs were concentrated 0.5 mg of proteins and solubilized in 100 ml of 40 mM Tris-HCl , pH 8.0 , 7.5 M urea , 2.0 M thiourea , reduced in the presence of 6 mM DTT , alkylated with 15 mM iodoacetamide and digested overnight with trypsin Promega , Madison , WI , USA , sequencing grade , estimated trypsin protein ratio 1 100 .

Each lane was cut into 20 slices and treated with trypsin Promega . Tryptic peptides were extracted with 60 % acetonitrile and 0.1 % formic acid , evaporated to dryness and resuspended in 25 ml of 3 % acetonitrile and 0.1 % formic acid . Peptide digests were analyzed in duplicate by LC-MS MS consisting of an Agilent 1100 Series nanoflow liquid chromatography system and a 1100 Series LC MSD-Trap-SL ion trap mass spectrometer Agilent Technologies .

20966961	Initiator caspases are commonly activated in high molecular weight complexes containing a protein with an activation-induced oligomerisation capacity that will in turn recruit the initiator caspase and induce its activation.1 The activation platform for caspase-2 has long remained enigmatic until the PIDDosome was identified , a complex consisting of PIDD p53-induced protein with a death domain LRDD , the adaptor protein RAIDD RIP-associated protein with a death domain CRADD and caspase-2.2�4 PIDD can also recruit RIP1 and NEMO in response to DNA damage , leading to NF-kB activation5,6 and was also recently described in a nuclear complex with DNA-PKcs and caspase-2 , formed in response to g-irradiation having a role in DNA repair and cell cycle checkpoint maintenance.7 The opposing signalling functions of PIDD , namely its pro-survival NF-kB activation and pro-death caspase-2 activa-tion functions , were shown to be dependent on different active fragments of PIDD , generated by auto-processing.6 Although a first processing event at S446 generates PIDD-N 1�445 , containing the N-terminus and the leucine-rich repeats , LRR and PIDD-C 446�910 , containing the C-terminus and the death-domain , DD , the second cleavage event at S588 produces the proapoptotic fragment PIDD-CC 588�910 , containing the DD . PIDD-C binds RIP1 and NEMO controlling the pro-survival NF-kB arm , whereas PIDD-CC together with RAIDD activates the apoptotic caspase-2 . PIDD-N has been suggested to act as a regulatory fragment . In unstimulated cells , both active fragments of PIDD can be readily detected because of constitutive auto-processing of the full-length protein , 6,8,9 but no activation of NF-kB or caspase-2 can be observed . In order to understand the mechanism of how PIDD activity is regulated , we screened for potential novel PIDD regulators and found many representa-tives of the molecular chaperone machinery . In this study , we focused on heat shock protein 90 Hsp90 as a potential regulatory interactor of PIDD . Molecular chaperones are characterised by their essential roles in protein folding , stability and maturation . In addition , several studies have reported the involvement of Hsp90 , in other cellular processes such as apoptosis.10 Moreover , NOD1 , a protein that shares common domain organisation with the core protein of initiator caspase activating platforms , was recently shown to be regulated by Hsp90.11 Results PIDD interacts with the molecular chaperone machinery . In recent years PIDD was found to be part of different multi-molecular regulatory complexes named PIDDosomes.4,5,7 In search of PIDD interaction partners , we performed a yeast-two hybrid and a proteomics screen . Both screens yielded high hit rates suggesting that PIDD is a nodal and highly connected protein . We found that PIDD appeared to be associate readily with many representatives of the molecular chaperone machinery including both the a and b isoforms of Hsp90 Table 1 . The interactions of PIDD with Hsp90 , its co-chaperone p23 and Hsp70 were confirmed in immunoprecipitates of HEK293T lysates stably expressing PIDD , also at the endogenous level Figure 1a and b . Table 1 Molecular chaperones found in PIDD interaction screens Abbreviaiton PIDD , p53-induced protein with a death domain To test the contribution of the co-chaperone p23 critical for Hsp90-client stabilisation12 in this interaction , p23 was downregulated using siRNA and PIDD was immunoprecipi-tated . We observed a reduction in Hsp90-PIDD complex formation , but not with Hsp70 , suggesting that p23 has a stabilising role for the Hsp90-PIDD interaction only Figure 1c . We further investigated these complexes by using geldanamycin GA , a well studied inhibitor of Hsp90 activity.13 The results show an efficient and rapid disruption of the Hsp90 p23 complex , indicating that p23 depends on Hsp90 for complex inclusion . In contrast , Hsp70 remained associated with PIDD following GA treatment Figure 1d . The co-chaperone CHIP carboxy terminus of Hsp70-interacting protein STUB1 , which also associates with PIDD Supplementary Figure 1A , was like Hsp70 not affected by the treatment Supplementary Figure 1B . CHIP contains a U-box domain , which is similar to the RING-finger motifs found in ubiquitin ligases.14 The ubiquitin ligase functions of CHIP are well described and it is thought that it uses chaperones such as Hsp70 as substrate-recognition components.15 LRR ZU-5 ZU-5 DD In order to determine the site of interaction between PIDD and Hsp90 in more detail , we expressed fragments of PIDD corresponding to the auto-cleavage products . Interestingly , the presence of both PIDD-N and PIDD-C is required for Hsp90 binding as neither fragment alone was found to interact with Hsp90 Figure 1e , Supplementary Figure 1C and D . The same pattern of interaction was observed for p23 . However , Hsp70 was able to associate with PIDD , as well as PIDD-N and PIDD-C . We further tested the interaction of the three different isoforms that have been described for PIDD with Hsp90 , p23 and Hsp70 . The results show a strong interaction of Hsp90 with isoform 1 only , whereas Hsp70 interacted strongly with isoform 2 , as well as , but less so , with isoforms 1 and 3 Supplementary Figure 1E . This may suggest that the interactions of Hsp70 and Hsp90 p23 with PIDD occur independently and possibly reflect different functional binding activities . PIDD stability is regulated by Hsp90 and CHIP . In a fashion similar to other Hsp90 client proteins like IRF-1 interferon regulators factor-1 , 16 both GA and Radicicol an alternative Hsp90 inhibitor17 treatments led to a dramatic decrease of PIDD protein levels Figure 2a and Supplementary Figure 2A , respectively . Noteworthy , the half-life of PIDD was around 2h during GA treatment , whereas other Hsp90 client such as IKKa and RIP118,19 were not markedly affected after 8h of treatment Figure 2a and Supplementary Figure 2B . In addition , PIDD-CC appeared more stable in response to GA . The sensitivity of PIDD-C to GA was also observed in other cell lines Supplementary Figure 2B and data not shown and suggests a high dependence of PIDD on Hsp90 for its stability . PIDD levels were not affected by cycloheximide CHX treatment during a similar time period , demonstrating that the effect seen is not due to a constitutively short half-life , in comparison to cFLIP , which is rapidly turned over Figure 2b . WB ? PIDD PIDD-C WB ? FLIP WB ? RAIDD WB ? Flag In agreement with previous studies on the stability of Hsp90 clients , 16,18 PIDD degradation in response to GA also occurs in a mainly proteasome-dependent manner , as shown by the inhibitory effect of MG132 Figure 2c , lane 4,5 versus 8,9 . Although over time PIDD degradation is also detected in the presence of MG132 Figure 2c , lane 6�9 . Previously demonstrated with c-erbB-2 , for example , 20 Hsp90 substrates are often ubiquitinated in response to GA preceding their degradation , which , as shown in Figure 2d , is also the case for PIDD . Considering the interaction between PIDD and CHIP Supplementary Figure 1B , we further investigated the involvement of the ubiquitin ligase and co-chaperone CHIP in the ubiquitination of PIDD in response to GA . It has been shown previously that CHIP can ubiquitinate client proteins such as LRKK2 LRR kinase 2 leading to its degradation.21 Overexpression of CHIP alone induced PIDD ubiquitination Figure 2e lane 3 versus 4 , whereas downregulation of CHIP using siRNA reduced the GA-induced modification Figure 2e lane 8 versus 9 . PIDD auto-processing requires an Hsp90-supported conformation . Heat shock proteins have long been known to have an important role in protein folding , supporting a conformation important for activity , as for example in the case of steroid receptors.22 Using an inducible expression system Flp-In T-Rex for PIDD in HEK293T HEK293T-Rex , we could observe a critical function for Hsp90 in the auto-processing function of PIDD. Figure 3a shows the accumulation of full-length PIDD upon induction when the cells were treated with GA . As previously reported , inhibition of protein synthesis by CHX treatment led to the conversion of PIDD to PIDD-C and finally to the accumulation of PIDD-CC in HEK293T cells stably expressing PIDD Figure 3b and6 . Simultaneous treatment with GA , however , retarded the disappearance of PIDD-C and the subsequent accumulation of PIDD-CC Figure 3b lane 3 versus 9 . We confirmed this observation in an in vitro auto-processing system using the PIDD F445H mutant , 6,23 where induction of processing generating the PIDD-C PIDD-CC not affected by the addition of hydroxylamine was abrogated in the presence of GA Figure 3c . Thus , GA inhibits cleavage of PIDD at both S446 and S588 sites , suggesting that the conformation of PIDD is altered in the absence of Hsp90 and does no longer support auto-processing . These findings suggest that optimal PIDD conformation , mediated by the chaperone function of Hsp90 , is essential for auto-cleavage . shown to act as a regulator of nuclear receptors as well as of several proteins involved in the apoptotic and inflammatory process . A general feature of this interaction is the release of Hsp90 from its client upon activation , which has been previously demonstrated , for example , in the case of PKR.22 To investigate whether the interaction of PIDD with heat shock proteins is affected under activating conditions , we took advantage of a cell-free system previously established.4,5 Hypotonic lysates from HEK293T cells stably expressing Flag-tagged PIDD were exposed to 371C , which induces PIDDosome complex formation . The immuno-precipitation IP showed a rapid release of Hsp90 and p23 from PIDD Figure 4a and Supplementary Figure 3A . The release of Hsp90 p23 was inversely correlated with the recruitment of NEMO . In contrast to Hsp90 , Hsp70 was further recruited to activated PIDD in the cell free system Figure 4a , which was also observed for CHIP Supplementary Figure 3B . To confirm this observation , we investigated the relation-ship between PIDD activation status and Hsp90 binding in HEK293T stably expressing PIDD , which exhibit constitutive Hsp90 is released upon PIDD activation . Hsp90 has been 25 - WB ? Hsp90 83 - WB ? p23 WB ? Hsp70 WB ? NEMO WB ? Flag PIDDosome formation.4 In agreement with previous data , 4 PIDD eluted in high and low molecular weight fractions in gel filtration experiments . In contrast , the majority of RAIDD eluted in fractions corresponding to its molecular weight around 23 kDa and only a small proportion eluted in high molecular weight fractions Figure 4b . This latter pool corresponds to RAIDD complexed in the PIDDosome . IP ? Flag-PIDD Lysates IP ? Flag-PIDD Lysates cy nu cy nu cy nu cy nu 47 - 32 - 25 - 16 - We suggest that more PIDD is found in high molecular weight fractions , because of PIDD being part of several different signalling complexes , not all of which contain RAIDD.5�7 IPs were carried out on different fractions of the gel filtration experiment . Fractions 15�18 were pooled and considered as the PIDDosome-enriched fraction fractions in which RAIDD is present . Fractions 22�25 and fractions 29�32 were pooled and considered as free PIDD-enriched fractions . The result shows that only non-complexed PIDD fractions 22�25 interacted with Hsp90 , whereas PIDD found in an active complex fractions 15�18 was not found to associate with Hsp90 Figure 4b . In fractions 29�32 , containing PIDD-CC only fragments , these were not found to associate with Hsp90 , in accordance with results shown in Figure 1e . PIDD translocates to the nucleus upon DNA damage , 5,6 performing functional roles in DNA repair and cell cycle checkpoint maintenance Logette E et al , personal communication .7 We therefore examined the localisation of PIDD-associated Hsp90 in HEK293T cells stably expressing PIDD . Cells were fractionated into cytoplasmic and nuclear samples and IPs of PIDD were performed with either equal amount of lysate or PIDD , as the levels differed between the two fractions Figure 4c . We found that Hsp90 was exclusively associated with cytoplasmic and not nuclear PIDD . Moreover , despite the fact that the PIDDosome as measured by the presence of RAIDD in the precipitates can be detected in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus , it appears to be enriched in the nucleus , and a greater amount of RAIDD is found in complex with nuclear PIDD Figure 4c , right panel . These data are in agreement with an activation-induced release of Hsp90 from PIDD and may suggest a role for Hsp90 in PIDD nuclear translocation following activation . The role of Hsp70 remains enigmatic , as it does not appear to bind nuclear PIDD at the basal level Figure 4c despite an overall increase in its association with PIDD following activation Figure 4a . Heat shock induces PIDD nuclear localisation and Hsp90 release . Owing to its identification as a p53-regulated gene and its death domain , PIDD has been extensively studied in response to genotoxic stress and in apoptotic induction.2,4�6,24 Little is known about other activators of the PIDDosome . However , a recent study by Green and colleagues25,26 identified caspase-2 as the initiator caspase activated during heat shock-induced apoptosis , this being dependent on RAIDD . We decided to investigate the PIDD-Hsp90 interaction during heat shock treatment . HEK293T cells stably expressing PIDD were subjected to heat shock at different temperatures . In a temperature-dependent manner , Hsp90 p23 was released from PIDD in our IP assay Figure 5a . Partial release was already detected at 401C incubation and substantial release of p23 and Hsp90 was observed at 42 and 431C , respectively Figure 5a . Our previous data showing that PIDD translocates to the nucleus upon DNA damage5,6 and that active PIDDosomes are enriched in the nucleus in cells stably expressing PIDD Figure 4c may suggest a relocalisation of PIDD also during heat stress . We confirmed this hypothesis by confocal microscopy and subcellular fractionation . The results show that 45 min of heat stress induced a strong nuclear transloca-tion of PIDD in both assays Figure 5b and c and Supplementary Figure 4 . PIDD translocation to the nucleus appeared to be very dynamic as PIDD nuclear staining decreased in a time-dependent manner when the cells were allowed to recover at 371C after the heat shock Figure 5b and c and Supplementary Figure 4 . Moreover , we monitored the binding of Hsp90 p23 to PIDD by IP and observed that the interaction is lost during heat stress , but is recovered once the temperature is reverted to 371C . This points to a correlation between Hsp90 p23 binding , PIDD relocalisation and possible activation Figure 5d . The interaction between Hsp70 and PIDD appeared less affected by heat shock treatment , mirroring the stability of this association during GA treatment and PIDD activation Figures 1d , 4d , 5a and d . Based on these results , further investigations to determine whether PIDD is actually activated during heat stress and how this affects a possible activation of caspase-2 would be of interest . Hsp90 is required for PIDD functions . Besides a clear role in protein folding , molecular chaperones are also involved in the activation and function of their clients , as for example demonstrated by the requirement of Hsp90 during IKK activation.19 We examined the potential involvement of Hsp90 in PIDD functions . PIDD has been shown to induce NF-kB in response to DNA damage through complex formation with RIP1 and NEMO , resulting in several modifications of NEMO sumoylation , phosphorylation and ubiquitination .5 HEK293T wild-type cells were pretreated for 20 min with GA before NF-kB induction by etoposide . Only short time points were studied to avoid the extensive degradation of PIDD observed after GA treatment Figure 2a . Pretreatment with GA efficiently inhibited the phosphorylation of IkB in response to etoposide , as shown in Figure 6a . PIDD levels remained constant during the course of the experiment and the activation of ATM , confirmed by its phosphorylation and the phosphorylation of p53 , remained unchanged . Importantly , TNFa-induced NF-kB activation was not inhibited by short GA pretreatment , demonstrating that RIP1 and IKKa , two Hsp90 clients involved in both TNFa-and etoposide-induced NF-kB activation , 18,19,27 remained functional in these settings Figure 6a , right panel . Functional inhibition of NF-kB was further confirmed by RT-PCR analysis of XIAP , a known NF-kB responsive gene Supplementary Figure 5 . Furthermore , as observed for IkB , NEMO phosphorylation and sumoylation were also affected by GA treatment , in contrast to p53 phosphorylation Figure 6b . Owing to the effects of GA seen on PIDD-mediated NF-kB signalling , we investigated further consequences of this treatment on PIDDosome activity . As observed in cells stably expressing PIDD , induction of PIDD in HEK293T-Rex cells also activated caspase-2 as measured by p19 formation Figure 6c and6 . GA treatment during PIDD induction resulted in the inhibition of caspase-2 activation as seen in Figure 6c , right panel . Caspase-2 and RAIDD recruitment to PIDD formation of the PIDDosome were reduced by the treatment Figure 6c , left panel . In summary , disruption of the interaction between PIDD and Hsp90 Figure 6c by GA treatment affected the function of PIDD during NF-kB signalling and PIDDosome-mediated caspase-2 activation . Heat shock proteins have become recognised as central players in cellular protein function , in particular their role in nuclear receptor biology has developed into an established model for chaperone activity.28 Hsp90 was shown to be an essential component maintaining the na ? ve � steroid receptor in a hormone-binding competent conformation.22 Reminiscent of this chaperoning function , we have shown here that PIDD requires Hsp90 for an auto-processing competent conforma-tion . Similar to PIDD , the nucleoporin Nup98 also exhibits strict structural requirements for HFS site auto-cleavage to occur 29,30 it would be interesting to establish whether Nup98 requires chaperones for proteolytic activity analogous to PIDD . The structural details of this Hsp90-dependent con-formation remain to be investigated , but the need for chaperones appears to be common among multi-domain proteins , which have to balance structural confinements with function . For example , LRR containing proteins , such as NLRs , have been shown to require Hsp90 and it has been suggested that chaperones might be able to support WB ? Hsp90 WB ? NEMO P-NEMO Lysates P-NEMO Lysates 32 - WB ? PIDD 47 - less stable , but functionally advantageous LRRs in their clients.31,32 This concept might also hold true for the LRR-containing PIDD with its auto-catalytic challenges . Structural studies on the related family member Unc5b demonstrated that under unstimulated conditions the ZU5-UPA-DD domain organisation , shared by PIDD , adopts a �closed� conformation , impairing protein activity via an intra-molecular auto-inhibitory mechanism . The authors propose that this conformation can be �opened� through regulatory protein interactions or post-translational modifications.33 It is tempting to speculate that Hsp90 may be involved in supporting a �relaxed� PIDD structure especially considering the hydrophobic nature of its core , allowing auto-cleavage and activation . This interaction could therefore serve as a regulatory step ensuring a dormant , but readily activated state of PIDD . Molecular chaperones are thought to have functional consequences on protein complexes without being part of its final effector organisation.34 In support of this hypothesis , we observed that activation of PIDD is associated with Hsp90 release and that nuclear PIDD enriched in signalling-compentent PIDDosomes does no longer interact with Hsp90 . In addition to the release of Hsp90 upon PIDD activation , we provide evidence that the Hsp90 PIDD inter-action before activation is required for the function of PIDD in NF-kB and caspase-2 activation . The results therefore demonstrate that although Hsp90 is required for PIDD auto-cleavage , stability and function , it is not a part of the final signalling complex , typical of chaperone proteins . Interestingly , it was recently published that Hsp90 is an inhibitor of caspase-2 activation following heat shock treat-ment.26 We found that Hsp90 is released from PIDD in response to heat stress . However , it remains to be seen whether PIDD is functionally activated by heat shock and whether this impacts on caspase-2 , as its activation by heat shock is unclear at present.35,36 If heat shock can functionally activate PIDD , it is possible that Hsp90 may in this case serve as the sensor . During our studies of these regulators , we observed an intriguing interaction of PIDD with Hsp70 , which was increased during PIDD activation , but not found in the nucleus . For now the exact nature of this interaction remains unknown . Hsp70 is an important protein under normal and stress responsive cellular functioning , which greatly hinders studies involving its downregulation.37 Moreover , an equiva-lent specific inhibitor , like GA for Hsp90 , is still not available for Hsp70 . However , we observed that , as with Hsp70 , CHIP was recruited to PIDD upon activation in vitro . It has been reported that CHIP depends on Hsp70 for the degradation of some of its targets , such as the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance receptor.38 Furthermore , CHIP is thought , apart from its functions in protein quality control , to also mark unwanted proteins for degradation , in particular in order to terminate signalling events.15 Therefore , the concomitant recruitment of Hsp70 and CHIP in response to PIDD activation may indicate a negative feedback loop on PIDD activity . In addition , we observed differential interactions of Hsp90 and Hsp70 with the three isoforms of PIDD . These isoforms have been described to exhibit different functions , for example , isoform-2 is thought to counteract isoform-1-driven proapoptotic effects.39 Further studies are underway to investigate whether the differential interactions of Hsp90 and Hsp70 with the isoforms have functional consequences . In conclusion , we propose that members of the molecular chaperone machinery , in particular Hsp90 , have an important role as regulators of PIDD stability , its processing and its signalling function . It is evident that molecular chaperone offer critical support for complex-forming proteins like PIDD and that there remains many exciting questions on the role of chaperones in signalling pathways .

20977549	Introduction The general transcription factor TFIID is a multipro-tein complex composed of TATA-binding protein TBP and 14 TBP-associated factors TAFs Mata-ngkasombut et al. 2004 Thomas Chiang 2006 . TFIID binds directly to the core promoter and func-tions with a number of other factors , including TFIIA , TFIIB , TFIIE , TFIIF , TFIIH , Mot1 , NC2 , mediator and RNA polymerase II pol II to accu-rately initiate transcription from specific site s in response to transcriptional activators Hahn 2004 Thomas Chiang 2006 . TBP binding to the core promoter is the rate-limiting step for efficient tran-scription in vivo Klein Struhl 1994 Kuras Struhl 1999 Li et al. 1999 . In Saccharomyces cerevisiae , TFIID and SAGA Spt-Ada-Gcn5-acetyltransferase deliver TBP to the core promoters for two types of class II genes , TATA-less constitutive �housekeeping� genes and TATA-containing highly inducible �stress-respon-sive� genes Basehoar et al. 2004 Huisinga Pugh 2004 . These two complexes share five TAFs and appear to be redundant for the expression of many Lee et al. 2000 but not all genes Zhang et al. 2008 . To show the function of each TAF , we and others isolated temperature-sensitive taf1 mutants that exhibit gene-specific transcriptional defects at the restrictive temperatures Walker et al. 1996 , 1997 Shen Green 1997 Tsukihashi et al. 2000 , 2001 . Intriguingly , the expression of CLN2 was affected significantly in the taf1�ts2 mutant isolated by M. Green and his col-leagues Walker et al. 1997 , whereas CLN2 expres-sion was only slightly affected in the taf1-N568D mutant isolated in our laboratory Tsukihashi et al. 2000 . However , these two taf1 mutants are otherwise phenotypically similar , including similar defects in G1 arrest our unpublished observations Walker et al. 1996 and transcription of other genes Tsukihashi et al. 2000 . Although these results suggested that Taf1p might influence the level of CLN2 transcrip-tion , this study shows that CLN2 expression is not influenced by allelic differences in TAF1 but is instead influenced by the different alleles of SSD1 i.e. , SSD1-V or ssd1-d in the strains used in these two studies . Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains carrying the ssd1-d allele , but not those carrying the SSD1-V allele , are inviable in the absence of Sit4p Sutton et al. 1991 . Sit4p is a serine ? threonine protein phosphatase that is required for the normal accumulation of CLN2 mRNA during late G1 phase of the cell cycle and is thought to play a role in the G1 to S transition Fer-nandez-Sarabia et al. 1992 . The G1 to S delay in the absence of Sit4p is mediated by up-regulation of Pkc1p Angeles de la Torre-Ruiz et al. 2002 . The Pkc1p-mediated MAPK pathway is essential for the maintenance of cell integrity under various environ-mental conditions , as well as during morphogenetic events like budding and mating projection formation Levin 2005 . This signaling pathway referred to as the �cell integrity pathway� is induced upon polarized cell growth during morphogenesis , as well as by cer-tain external stimuli that affect cell wall stability e.g. , high temperature and hypotonic shock , and can mediate cell wall reconstruction and ? or remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton Levin 2005 . In contrast , the TOR pathway , which controls cell growth in response to nutrient availability , negatively regulates the Pkc1p-mediated cell integrity pathway by stimulating com-plex formation between Sit4p and Tap42p Torres et al. 2002 . The TOR pathway is essential for viabil-ity in ssd1-d strains , but not in SSD1-V strains Reinke et al. 2004 . Given that Ssd1p mediates a distinct , but parallel , pathway to that mediated by Pkc1p to ensure cell integrity Kaeberlein Guarente 2002 , the lethality of ssd1-d when combined with Dsit4 Sutton et al. 1991 or Dtor1 Reinke et al. 2004 may suggest that the Ssd1p-mediated cell integrity pathway is cru-cial not only when the Pkc1p-mediated pathway is less active Costigan et al. 1992 Martin et al. 1996 but also when it is more active than normal . The molecular function of Ssd1p remains enig-matic , even though extensive studies have implicated SSD1 in a wide range of biologic events including cell cycle progression Sutton et al. 1991 , secretion Li Warner 1996 , 1998 , longevity Kaeberlein et al. 2004 Li et al. 2009 , pathogenicity Wheeler et al. 2003 , thermotolerance Mir et al. 2009 , cell morphogenesis Du Novick 2002 Jorgensen et al. 2002 and maintenance of cell integrity Kaeberlein Guarente 2002 Reinke et al. 2004 . Biochemical studies showed that Ssd1p binds to RNA Uesono et al. 1997 and the carboxy-terminal domain CTD of pol II Phatnani et al. 2004 , suggesting that Ssd1p may regulate the expression of specific genes at the transcriptional and ? or post-transcriptional levels . Recently , two genome-wide studies showed that Ssd1p binds to a subset of mRNAs in vivo , including CLN2 Hogan et al. 2008 and many other mRNA encoding cell wall�related proteins Hogan et al. 2008 Jansen et al. 2009 . Remarkably , translation of some Ssd1p-bound mRNA appears to be regulated locally via the phosphorylation of Ssd1p by Cbk1p Jansen et al. 2009 , which is a component of the Regulation of Ace2p activity and cellular Morpho-genesis RAM signaling network Nelson et al. 2003 . RAM is composed of two kinases , Cbk1p and Kic1p , and several associated proteins , Mob2p , Hym1p , Tao3p and Sog2p Nelson et al. 2003 , and is essential for cell viability in SSD1-V but not in ssd1-d cells Du Novick 2002 Jorgensen et al. 2002 . Importantly , this signaling network plays a critical role in cell morphogenesis , cell separation and maintenance of cell integrity Nelson et al. 2003 Kurischko et al. 2005 . The SSD1-V strain requires the morphogenetic function but not the Ace2p-related function e.g. , cell separation of RAM for viability . The Cdc28p�Cln2p complex is required not only for cell cycle progression , but also for morphogenesis , e.g. , bud emergence and polarized cell growth at the bud tip Lew Reed 1993 McCusker et al. 2007 . The Cdc28p�Cln2p complex appears to regulate these morphogenetic events by activating two distinct GTPases , Rho1p Kono et al. 2008 and Cdc42p McCusker et al. 2007 . Rho1p also acts upstream of Pkc1p and promotes cell integrity pathway Levin 2005 . Furthermore , Whi3p , an RNA-binding pro-tein that binds to a number of mRNAs including those of the G1 cyclins Colomina et al. 2008 , may be involved in apical bud growth by facilitating the local formation of an active Cdc28p�Cln2p complex at the bud apex Colomina et al. 2009 . The goal of this study was to determine the precise mechanisms by which Ssd1p regulates CLN2 expres-sion in taf1 mutants . Our data show that Ssd1p binds to the 5�-untranslated region UTR of CLN2 mRNA in vivo for its stabilization and for continuous transcription of CLN2 under certain specific condi-tions . Furthermore , we propose that Ssd1p may be regulated by RAM not only when it is bound to cell wall�related mRNA Jansen et al. 2009 but also when it is bound to CLN2 mRNA . This would result in the activation of the Cdc28p�Cln2p complex in a spatially restricted manner , according to a mechanism not unlike the one previously proposed for Whi3p . Results CLN2 expression is more severely affected by taf1 in the ssd1-d strain than in the SSD1-V strain Previously , we and others have isolated several tem-perature-sensitive taf1 mutants that show different gene-specific transcriptional defects Shen Green 1997 Walker et al. 1997 Tsukihashi et al. 2000 , 2001 . Specifically , taf1�ts2 Shen Green 1997 Walker et al. 1997 and taf1-N568D Tsukihashi et al . 2000 , 2001 reduced the expression of CLB5 and RPS5 , but not that of ADH1 , at the restrictive tem-peratures . In contrast , only the former mutation severely affected CLN2 expression under the same conditions Fig. 1A Walker et al. 1997 Tsukihashi et al. 2000 . Hence , we sought to determine whether this specific defect in CLN2 transcription is because of differences in the taf1 alleles or because of differ-ences in the genetic backgrounds of the yeast strains used in the two studies . Therefore , we exchanged the taf1 alleles between the two strains , YSW and Y22.1 , which were used in the original studies compare Fig. 1A and B . The expression of CLN2 was exam-ined in these new strains at the restrictive tempera-tures Fig. 1B . The results clearly showed that the defect in CLN2 transcription is caused by the genetic background of the YSW strain and not by differences in the taf1 alleles . Transcription of CLN1 and CLN2 is activated by SBF , a heterodimeric transcription factor complex composed of Swi4p and Swi6p , during the late G1 phase of the cell cycle Nasmyth Dirick 1991 Ogas et al. 1991 . SIT4 encodes a serine ? threonine protein phosphatase required for the normal accumulation of CLN1 , CLN2 and SWI4 mRNA during late G1 Fernandez-Sarabia et al. 1992 . Intriguingly , SSD1 is polymorphic Sutton et al. 1991 and interacts geneti - cally with SIT4 Sutton et al. 1991 , CLN1 ? CLN2 Cvrckova Nasmyth 1993 and SWI4 ? SWI6 Kae-berlein Guarente 2002 . For instance , Dsit4 is lethal in ssd1-d strains but viable in SSD1-V wild-type strains Fig. 1C Sutton et al. 1991 . Therefore , we postulate a possible role of SSD1 in regulating CLN2 . To test this possibility , the SSD1 alleles in YSW and Y22.1 strains , which were determined to be ssd1-d and SSD1-V , respectively data not shown , were exchanged between the two strain backgrounds Fig. 1D . Therefore , the effect of TAF1 and SSD1 genotype on the expression of CLN2 was tested inde-pendently of strain background . The results show that CLN2 expression was reduced only in Y22.1-derived strains with ssd1-d and mutant taf1 at the restrictive temperature Fig. 1D . CLN2 expression was lower in taf1 SSD1-V than in TAF1 SSD1-V cells compare lane 4 with lanes 5 and 6 but significantly higher than in taf1 ssd1-d cells compare lanes 5 and 6 with lanes 11 and 12 . The effect of taf1 on CLN2 expression was variable compare lanes 7�8 in Fig. 1A , B with lanes 4�6 in Fig. 1D , which may depend on the kinetics of recovery from heat shock Fig. 2A . These observations indicate that the SSD1 genotype confers strain-specific differences in CLN2 transcription in YSW and Y22.1 cells expressing mutant taf1 . This conclusion is supported by the fact that SSD1 genotype i.e. , SSD1-V or ssd1-d also influences the expression of CLN2 in BY4741 ? 4742 strains Brachmann et al. 1998 in a taf1-dependent manner Fig. 1E . Synergistic effects of taf1 and ssd1-d on recovery of CLN2 expression after mild heat shock The results described earlier showed that taf1-N568D and ssd1-d synergistically reduce CLN2 expression after 2 h at 36 or 37.5 ? C . The expression of CLN2 was transiently reduced , undergoing a rapid down-regulation approximately 20 min and subsequent recovery within a short time approximately 60 min after mild heat shock even in wild-type cells Rowley et al. 1993 . Here , we examined the kinetics of expression of CLN2 Fig. 2A , TAF1-dependent RPS5 Fig. 2B and TAF1-independent ADH1 Fig. 2C as a function of TAF1 and SSD1 genotype . The results showed that ssd1-d delays the recovery of CLN2 expression , even in cells containing TAF1 compare TAF1 , SSD1-V vs TAF1 , ssd1-d Fig. 2A . As expected from Fig. 1 , CLN2 expression was diminished 2 h after the temperature shift in the taf1-N568D ssd1-d strain Fig. 2A . Remarkably , a faint recovery in CLN2 expression was reproducibly observed approximately 35 min after the temperature shift even in the double-mutant strain , suggesting that transcription reinitiates at this time but does not con-tinue under these conditions . In addition , CLN2 expression does not recover fully in the taf1-N568D SSD1-V strain compare TAF1 , SSD1-V vs. N568D , SSD1-V in Fig. 2A . Whether partial recovery reflects the direct involvement of Taf1p in CLN2 transcrip-tion or the loss of transcription of other cyclins , like CLB5 Tsukihashi et al. 2000 , which are required for the recovery of CLN2 expression after mild heat shock Li Cai 1999 , is currently unclear . Finally , CLN2 mRNA was slightly but consistently higher 10 min after heat shock in SSD1-V strains than in ssd1-d strains , irrespective of whether the cells carried TAF1 or taf1-N568D , suggesting that Ssd1p may stabilize a small fraction of CLN2 mRNA or may support CLN2 transcription at low levels . Importantly , a similar enhanced recovery of mRNA was not observed in SSD1-V strains for A C D E RPS5 Fig. 2B or ADH1 Fig. 2C , even though the kinetics of the down-regulation and recovery of RPS5 transcription after mild heat shock in TAF1 strains were similar to CLN2 Kim Warner 1983 . Unexpectedly , the expression of ADH1 during recov-ery from heat shock was higher than the preheat shock level in taf1-N568D strains Fig. 2C . How-ever , Ssd1p does not play any role in this phenome-non . These results suggest that Ssd1p stabilizes CLN2 mRNA and ? or enhances CLN2 transcription after heat shock . The stabilization effect may reflect the fact that Ssd1p binds to RNA in vitro Uesono et al. 1997 as well as in vivo Hogan et al. 2008 Jansen Ssd1p stabilizes a subpopulation of CLN2 mRNA To assess the possibility that Ssd1p stabilizes a sub-population of CLN2 mRNA , we added 1,10-phenan-throline PT , a transcriptional inhibitor whose effects are most similar to rpb1-1 Santiago et al. 1986 Grigull et al. 2004 in inhibiting �on-going� transcrip-tion , and quantified the residual i.e. , relatively stable CLN2 mRNA during the postheat shock recovery phase Fig. 3A , B . Remarkably , most of the CLN2 mRNA that accumulated in the taf1-N568D SSD1-V strain by 90 min after the temperature shift was resis-tant to 1,10-PT . In contrast , the CLN2 mRNA that accumulated in the TAF1 SSD1-V wild-type strain under the same conditions decreased rapidly upon the addition of 1,10-PT approximately 20 % of the level before the shift . SCR1 transcription driven by pol III was only minimally affected under these conditions Fig. 3A . Thus , these observations indicate that a low level of CLN2 transcription occurs in the taf1-N568D SSD1-V strain and that most of the mRNA is stabi-lized by Ssd1p , whereas CLN2 transcription is much more active in the wild-type strain , but only a sub-population nearly the same amount as in the taf1-N568D SSD1-V strain of the mRNA is stabilized by Ssd1p . Less than 5 % of CLN2 mRNA was detected 10� 15 min after the temperature shift even in SSD1-V strains Figs 2A and 3A , B . Thus , the stabilizing effect of Ssd1p on CLN2 mRNA must be gradually aug-mented up to approximately 20 % after the shift . To test this hypothesis , 1,10-PT was added at several dif-ferent time points after heat shock Fig. 3C . CLN2 mRNA level stabilized by Ssd1p increased gradually over time in TAF1 or taf1-N568D cells . In contrast , the reduction in CLN2 mRNA after the addition of 1,10-PT representing �on-going� transcription appears to be constant during the recovery phase in the taf1-N568D SSD1-V strain . Therefore , we con-clude that CLN2 transcription occurs continuously even in the taf1-N568D SSD1-V strain and that the stabilizing effects of Ssd1p on CLN2 mRNA gradu-ally increase after the temperature shift regardless of the allelic state of TAF1 . Similar experiments were conducted in strains car-rying a temperature-sensitive allele of the largest sub-unit of pol II rpb1-1 Nonet et al. 1987 . In rpb1-1 strains , pol II-dependent transcription is abolished within 5 min at 37 ? C Nonet et al. 1987 . Strikingly , Fig. 3D , E show that Ssd1p could stabilize a subpopu-lation approximately 20 % of CLN2 mRNA , but not RPS5 , ADH1 or TUB1 mRNAs . The observa-tion that Ssd1p could stabilize maximal amounts of CLN2 mRNA at early times approximately 20 min after temperature shift in the rpb1-1 strain seems to be contradictory to the findings that the stabilizing effects of Ssd1p on CLN2 mRNA increase gradually after heat shock Fig. 3C . The levels of Ssd1p in wild-type and rpb1-1 strains were similar before and after heat shock data not shown . In contrast , the levels of Ssd1p were similar or slightly decreased in the taf1-N568D strain after heat shock Fig. S1 in Supporting Information . Therefore , this apparent discrepancy may be attributed to improper activation of Ssd1p in the rpb1-1 strain at lower temperatures . It is also noteworthy that the stabilizing effect of Ssd1p was clearly observed for only a subpopulation of CLN2 mRNA i.e. , 1,10-PT-resistant transcripts or the stable transcripts that remained in the rpb1-1 strain at 37.5 ? C and not for the rest of the CLN2 mRNA i.e. , 1,10-PT-sensitive transcripts or the transcripts that were rapidly degraded in the rpb1-1 strain at 37.5 ? C , as the decay rates of the latter frac-tion did not appear to be affected by Ssd1p in either TAF1 or taf1-N568D background strains Fig. 3 and Fig. S2 in Supporting Information . Therefore , we further analyzed the function of Ssd1p that generates the former fraction of CLN2 mRNA as described in the following sections . N-terminal PCID domain of Ssd1p plays a role in continuous transcription of CLN2 Ssd1p has at least two distinct functional domains Fig. 1C , the phosphoCTD-interacting domain PCID Phatnani et al. 2004 and ribonuclease II homology domain RNB , Pfam # 00773 Uesono et al. 1997 , with distinct biochemical and functional properties . The protein product of ssd1-d lacks the RNB domain and is partially functional Kaeberlein Guarente 2002 Kaeberlein et al. 2004 Mir et al. 2009 , indicat-ing that each domain plays a unique functional role in Ssd1p . The results obtained elsewhere indicate that Ssd1p has two activities it stabilizes a subpopulation of CLN2 mRNA and it facilitates the continuous tran-scription of CLN2 in taf1-N568D cells after heat shock the latter point is summarized schematically in Fig. S2 in Supporting Information . The role of the PCID and RNB domains in these two distinct activities was examined using domain deletion mutants ssd1-DPCID and ssd1-d . First , we compared the recovery of CLN2 mRNA after heat shock in SSD1-V , ssd1-DPCID , ssd1-d and Dssd1 strains carrying either TAF1 or taf1-N568D Fig. 4A . Small amounts of CLN2 mRNA were observed reproducibly 10 min after the temperature shift in the SSD1-V and ssd1-DPCID strains , regard-less of whether the cells contained TAF1 or taf1-N568D , suggesting that RNB , but not PCID , A C D A B C D is required for the stabilization of CLN2 mRNA . Consistent with the results in Fig. 2 , none of these alleles of SSD1 affected the recovery of transcription of RPS5 and ADH1 under these conditions Fig. 4A . CLN2 expression was also examined at multiple time points during heat shock recovery in SSD1-V and ssd1-DPCID cells carrying either TAF1 or taf1-N568D with or without 1,10-PT treatment 90 min after temperature shift Fig. 4B , C . The results show that the ability of Ssd1p lacking PCID Ssd1p-DPCID to support the continuous accumulation of CLN2 mRNA during the recovery phase is impaired and differences were particularly apparent by 50 min or later after the temperature shift Fig. 4B . Consid-ering that the ability of Ssd1p to stabilize CLN2 mRNA in the TAF1 strain appears to be unaffected or only slightly affected by DPCID even at 90 min after the shift Fig. 4C , such impairment is probably due to a reduced ability of Ssd1p-DPCID to facilitate the continuous transcription of CLN2 in the taf1-N568D strain . Notably , the addition of 1,10-PT at 90 min after the shift also decreased the amounts of CLN2 mRNA , slightly but reproducibly , in the taf1-N568D ssd1-DPCID strain Fig. 4C , indicating that the transcriptional activity of Ssd1p-DPCID is still functional at least in part . However , the amount of stabilized CLN2 mRNA was not reduced in rpb1-1 strains with the ssd1-DPCID allele Fig. 4D . Collec-tively , these observations support the hypothesis that PCID and RNB play distinct roles in promot-ing CLN2 expression presumably at the transcrip-tional and post-transcriptional levels , respectively , consistent with a previous observation that Ssd1p localizes to both the nucleus and cytoplasm Uesono et al. 1997 . The two activities of Ssd1p depend on the 5�-UTR of CLN2 mRNA One possible explanation for these results is that cis-element s in the CLN2 gene region regulate its expression in an Ssd1p-dependent manner . This idea was tested using a plasmid-based mini-CLN2 reporter system Tsukihashi et al. 2000 Fig. 5A in a strain carrying an intact endogenous CLN2 locus . In this system , the mini-CLN2 reporter and endogenous CLN2 generate shorter and longer mRNAs , respec-tively , which can be detected with a single probe . Endogenous CLN2 mRNA serves as an internal posi-tive control Fig. 5B , C . The mini-CLN2 reporter CCC and deletion derivatives are shown in Fig. 5A . The CCC construct carries the UAS , the core promoter and 5�-UTR from CLN2 . Derivatives of CCC were deleted for the indicated region or carry the corresponding region s from RPS5 details including junction infor-mation are shown in Fig. S3 in Supporting Informa-tion . Expression of the reporter and endogenous CLN2 was measured in TAF1 SSD1-V or ssd1-d and taf1-N568D SSD1-V or ssd1-d cells Fig. 5B . The results show that Ssd1p stabilized the small amounts of CLN2 mRNA 10 min after heat shock and facilitated continuous transcription in the taf1-N568D strain with the CCC and RRC constructs , but not with the RRR , CCR and CCD constructs Fig. 5B . Although the former activity is weaker for the reporter than for endogenous CLN2 probably because the stability of mini-CLN2 mRNA is differ-ent from that of endogenous one , these results indi-cate that the 5�-UTR of CLN2 is crucial for both Ssd1p functions . Similar results were obtained when the CCC , CCR and RRC constructs were integrated into the AUR1 locus of the yeast strains Fig. S4 in Supporting Information , indicating that Ssd1p activities can be faithfully measured even on the reporter plas-mid . Furthermore , Ssd1p stabilizes mRNA from CCC but not from CCD in rpb1-1 strains , and this effect requires the 3�-half UTR2 of the 5�-UTR of CLN2 CC-UTR2 in Fig. 5C . The 5�-half UTR1 of the 5�-UTR stabilized the similar amounts approximately 20 % of mini-CLN2 mRNA however , this effect was independent of Ssd1p CC-UTR1 in Fig. 5C . These results suggest that UTR2 may destabilize a subpopula-tion of CLN2 mRNA and that Ssd1p suppresses the negative effect of UTR2 to generate a pool of stabi-lized CLN2 mRNA . It is not yet known whether the ability of Ssd1p to stabilize the small amounts of CLN2 mRNA 10 min after the initiation of heat shock Fig. 5B also depends on UTR2 , because the effects were marginal in our assay data not shown . Reporter constructs lacking CLN2-UAS are not transiently down-regulated by mild heat shock Fig. S5B in Supporting Information . However , in mini-CLN2 reporter assays with constructs lacking the UAS but carrying the 5�-UTR , Ssd1p facilitates the continuous transcription of the CLN2 reporter in the taf1-N568D strain compare CC and RC with RR , CR and CD in Fig. S5B in Supporting Informa-tion . This Ssd1p activity requires UTR2 , but not UTR1 compare C-UTR1 and C-UTR2 in Fig. S5B in Supporting Information . Additionally , the core promoter , ORF and terminator of CLN2 are not required for this activity , as RPS5 mRNA expressed from its original promoter and terminator , but containing the CLN2 5�-UTR , accumulated at higher levels in the taf1-N568D SSD1-V strain than in the taf1-N568D ssd1-d strain RC-Rot in Fig. S5B in Supporting Information . Collectively , these results strongly suggest that the distal region of the 5�-UTR i.e. , UTR2 of CLN2 may be required for the two distinct activities of Ssd1p . Ssd1p binds to UTR2 of CLN2 mRNA A recent genome-wide study showed that Ssd1p binds to CLN2 mRNA in vivo Hogan et al. 2008 . Thus , the results of the functional studies described elsewhere may suggest that Ssd1p binds to the 5�-UTR of CLN2 mRNA Fig. 5 and Figs S4 and S5 in Supporting Information . This idea was tested using RNA immunoprecipitation RIP assays , as originally developed by Svejstrup and colleagues Gilbert et al. 2004 . First , we tested the binding of pol II to the mRNA of actively transcribed genes , e.g. , CLN2 , RPS5 and ADH1 , in cells carrying SSD1-V , ssd1-DPCID or ssd1-d Fig. 6B . The results clearly showed that pol II binds to these mRNAs at 25 and 37.5 ? C 2 h after the temperature shift regardless of the SSD1 allele present , indicating that the RIP assays could detect physiologically relevant binding of a given factor to these mRNAs . As expected , no signals were detected when the RT reverse transcription reaction was omitted , indicating that these signals were derived from mRNA and not from contaminating DNA data not shown . The same controls were used for all the other immunoprecipitation experiments described in the following sections data not shown . Using the same assay , we found that Ssd1p binds preferentially to CLN2 mRNA compared to RPS5 A B or ADH1 mRNAs Fig. 6C . Although Ssd1p binds weakly to the latter mRNAs , it did not promote the expression of these mRNAs . However , this weak binding appears to be specific because the binding of Taf1p to these mRNAs was the same as the control i.e. vector , no tag and significantly lower than that of Ssd1p Fig. 6C . Although the physiologic role of such weak binding remains unknown , this may reflect in vitro binding of Ssd1p to poly A + RNA Uesono et al. 1997 . Mutant Ssd1p , encoded by ssd1-DPCID or ssd1-d , bound to CLN2 mRNA at lower levels than wild-type Ssd1p , encoded by SSD1-V , although all the Ssd1p proteins bound equally to RPS5 and ADH1 mRNA . Importantly , these Ssd1p derivatives were all expressed at similar levels Fig. S1B in Sup-porting Information . Collectively , these observations indicate that two distinct functional domains , i.e. , PCID and RNB , are required for the binding of Ssd1p to CLN2 mRNA , whereas either domain is sufficient for the weak binding to other mRNAs . Next , we determined whether Ssd1p binds to UTR1 and ? or UTR2 of CLN2 mRNA by conducting RIP assays for the same set of mini-CLN2 reporter constructs as described earlier Fig. 6D . The Ssd1p proteins encoded by SSD1-V , ssd1-DPCID and ssd1-d displayed nearly the same binding profiles for the CCC and CC-UTR2 constructs as that for endogenous CLN2 mRNA right panels in Fig. 6D , but binding to the RRR , CCR , CCD and CC-UTR1 constructs was reduced left panels in Fig. 6D . These results indi-cate that Ssd1p binds to the CLN2 UTR2 in vivo . Taken together , these data indicate that Ssd1p pro-motes CLN2 expression at both transcriptional and ? or post-transcriptional levels by binding to the UTR2 of CLN2 mRNA . Ssd1p increases occupancy levels of TFIIB and pol II on the reporter gene in taf1-N568D cells The results described elsewhere Fig. 3A�C , Fig. S2 in Supporting Information showed that Ssd1p can facilitate continuous CLN2 transcription in taf1-N568D cells . To confirm this possibility more directly , we conducted chromatin immunoprecipita-tion ChIP analyses to examine the occupancy levels of the promoter and ? or coding region of CLN2 by TFIIB and pol II after mild heat shock . According to our model , the occupancy levels of these regions should be higher in taf1-N568D SSD1-V cells than in taf1-N568D ssd1-d cells . However , because CLN2 transcription was very weak in taf1-N568D cells after mild heat shock and the contribution of continuous transcription to the accumulation of CLN2 mRNA was quite small Fig. 3A , B , we failed to observe sig-nificant differences in the occupancies of these regions by TFIIB and pol II between SSD1-V and ssd1-d cells data not shown . Thus , we decided to examine occupancy by pol II of the coding region of mini-CLN2 , which produces larger amounts of mRNA than endogenous CLN2 Fig. 5B . In agreement with our model , the occupancy signals were slightly but reproducibly higher in taf1-N568D SSD1-V cells than in taf1-N568D ssd1-d cells Fig. S6B in Supporting Information . Subsequently , we also examined TFIIB and pol II occupancies of the promoter region of mini-RPS5 ? CLN2 , which shows the same transcrip-tional response to mild heat shock as mini-CLN2 Fig. S6C in Supporting Information . This reporter enabled us to test the occupancies of these regions without any interference from signals derived from endogenous CLN2 . The results clearly showed that the occupancies of this promoter by TFIIB and pol II were higher in taf1-N568D SSD1-V cells than in taf1-N568D ssd1-d cells Fig. S6D in Supporting Information . As expected , similar differences were not observed for the promoter and ? or coding region of RPS5 Fig. S6E in Supporting Information . Col-lectively , these results strongly support our model that Ssd1p facilitates the continuous transcription of CLN2 in taf1-N568D cells after mild heat shock . Counterintuitively , our ChIP experiments failed to detect significant occupancy signals of the CLN2 pro-moter by Ssd1p data not shown . There are few precedents for a factor that regulates transcription from downstream site s , e.g. , by binding to its target mRNA , especially in yeast . Elongator is a well-known protein complex that has multiple functions in transcriptional elongation and tRNA modification Svejstrup 2007 . This factor has been suggested to regulate transcription by binding to a phosphorylated form of pol II and nascent RNA emanating from elongating pol II . These actions would occur down-stream of the promoter . Remarkably , the binding of this factor to active genes could not be detected by ChIP . It is noteworthy that these physical and ? or functional properties of Elongator also appear to be shared by Ssd1p . mRNA containing UTR1 alone was similar to or weaker than that of the other two types of mRNA WT , D under the same conditions Fig. S8G in Supporting Information , indicating that the former mRNA is much less efficiently translated than the lat-ter two mRNAs . Importantly , cell cycle progression after the G1 release was not significantly affected either by ssd1-d or by the 5�-UTR of CLN2 mRNA Fig. S8E in Supporting Information , suggesting redundant and compensatory roles for other G1 cyc-lins in these cells . As a whole , these data suggest that Ssd1p is not involved in cell cycle progression , at least under nonstress conditions examined here . Discussion Ssd1p plays an essential role in the Dsit4 strain Sutton et al. 1991 . Sit4p is involved in the transcription of a particular subset of genes including HIS4 Arndt et al. 1989 , INO1 Shirra et al. 2005 and nitrogen catabo-lite repression-sensitive genes Beck Hall 1999 Tate et al. 2009 . These observations suggest that Ssd1p is also involved in the transcription of a certain subset of genes . In fact , SSD1-V suppresses mutations in pol I , II and III Stettler et al. 1993 . Using a gen-ome-wide approach , Ssd1p was recently shown to bind to more than 50 Hogan et al. 2008 or 150 Jansen et al. 2009 target mRNAs in vivo , including CLN2 Hogan et al. 2008 however , the functional significance of these Ssd1p ? mRNA interactions has just begun to be elucidated Jansen et al. 2009 . This study , for the first time , characterizes in detail the mechanism by which Ssd1p promotes the expression of one of its target genes , CLN2 . 5�-half of the 5�-UTR UTR1 stabilizes the similar amounts of CLN2 mRNA independently of Ssd1p in rpb1-1 cells Fig. 5C . These data suggest that there are at least two types of CLN2 mRNA and that a minor population approximately 20 % after heat shock is targeted and stabilized by Ssd1p . We specu-late that UTR2 may contain destabilizing element s that are particularly affected in Ssd1p-targeted CLN2 mRNA and that the destabilizing activity is concealed by binding Ssd1p . Intriguingly , CLN2 mRNA stabi-lized by Ssd1p , e.g. , at 90 min after heat shock in taf1-N568D SSD1-V cells Fig. 3A , B or at 20 min or later after heat shock in rpb1-1 cells Fig. 3D , E , appears to be translationally inactive because Cln2p is almost undetectable by immunoblotting Figs S9 and S10C in Supporting Information . Total RNA prepared from heat-shocked rpb1-1 cells contains a significant amount of poly A + CLN2 mRNA , sug-gesting that stabilized CLN2 mRNA is processed normally to a mature form Fig. S10B in Supporting Information . These observations indicate that Ssd1p stabilizes a subpopulation of CLN2 mRNA in a translationally inactive form by binding to UTR2 of the 5�-UTR . In addition to its ability to stabilize CLN2 mRNA , Ssd1p can facilitate continuous CLN2 tran-scription in taf1-N568D cells Fig. 3A�C , Fig. S2 in Supporting Information . Recovery of CLN2 expres-sion after heat shock was completely inhibited even in the presence of Ssd1p in the double-mutant taf1-N568D Dspt3 strain , which is inactive in both TFIID and SAGA , whereas recovery was almost normal or greater than normal in the Dspt3 strain data not shown . These observations indicate that TFIID and SAGA play redundant roles in CLN2 transcription , although it can not be excluded that this reflects tran-scriptional defects in other cyclin genes , as described earlier . If both factors mediate CLN2 transcription , Ssd1p may play a more important role in SAGA-dependent transcription than in TFIID-dependent transcription because Ssd1p activity is still evident in taf1-N568D cells . In fact , the stabilizing effect of Ssd1p on a subpopulation approximately 20 % of CLN2 mRNA was not observed in the Dspt3 rpb1-1 strain data not shown . These results are consistent with the hypothesis that there are two types of CLN2 mRNA , namely an Ssd1p-dependent minor portion and an Ssd1p-independent major portion of CLN2 mRNA , which may be generated mainly by SAGA and TFIID , respectively . In this model , Ssd1p depen-dency is determined during transcription , which could explain why Ssd1p can stabilize only a subpopulation of CLN2 mRNA . Consistently , intron-containing primary transcripts were enriched by Ssd1p RIP assays in a previous study Hogan et al. 2008 , suggesting that Ssd1p binds to its target mRNAs in the nucleus , while they are being transcribed . Cis-element mapping experiments showed that the 5�-UTR is required for both activities of Ssd1p Fig. 5 and Figs S4 and S5 in Supporting Informa-tion . However , whether the 5�-UTR of CLN2 functions at the DNA promoter or the mRNA level to support continuous transcription facilitated by Ssd1p in taf1-N568D cells is unclear . Considering that the PCID of Ssd1p appears to be involved in this activity Fig. 4 and is also partially defective in bind-ing to CLN2 mRNA Fig. 6C , D , we suggest that Ssd1p facilitates continuous transcription by interact-ing with the 5�-UTR of the CLN2 mRNA and not that of the promoter DNA . This is consistent with our ChIP data , which indicates that there is no signif-icant binding of Ssd1p to the CLN2 promoter data not shown , as well as recent data indicating that SAGA is closely related to both transcription and mRNA export Baker Grant 2007 . Ssd1p also accelerates the recovery of CLN2 expression after heat shock in the TAF1 strain Fig. 2A . This activity is independent of the 5�-UTR Fig. S7A , B in Supporting Information but requires the UAS and the core promoter from CLN2 Fig. 5B . Because Ssd1p does not appear to bind to the CLN2 promoter data not shown , this effect may reflect enhanced activity of SBF , which binds to the CLN2 UAS , and is activated by the cell integrity pathway involving Ssd1p after heat shock Levin 2005 . Rrp44p is a catalytic component of the exosome and carries endo-and exo-nucleolytic activities within its amino-terminal PIN domain and carboxy-terminal RNB domain , respectively Wilusz 2009 . The RNB domain of Ssd1p is structurally similar to that of Rrp44p Sutton et al. 1991 , but the residues crucial for exonucleolytic activity Lorentzen et al. 2008 are not conserved in Ssd1p Fig. S11 in Supporting Infor-mation , implying that Ssd1p lacks nuclease activity Uesono et al. 1997 . Thus , we suggest that Ssd1p binds to a subpopulation of CLN2 mRNA and sequesters it without degradation and ? or translation until appropriate conditions enable the release of the mRNA . by which the interaction between Ssd1p and CLN2 mRNA is regulated in yeast cells .

21050342	Introduction Human embryonic stem cells hESCs are a potential source of cardiomyocytes for future heart therapy . The hESCs might also represent a valuable model for studying early embryonic cardiac development because they proliferate indefinitely in an undifferen-tiated state and potentially have the ability to differen-tiate into all types of cardiac cells , including atrial , Communicated by Hideyuki Okano and the rapid proliferation of cardiomyocytes Martin-Puig et al. 2008 . Therefore , the induction of anterior PS formation is a key step for mimicking cardiac development in hESCs . Although multiple signaling pathways are involved in PS formation Rossant Tam 2004 Gadue et al. 2005 , Wnt ? b-catenin signal-ing plays a central role in the development of the mesoderm Lickert et al. 2002 Tam Loebel 2007 . During heart development , cardiac progenitors are exposed to various signaling molecules , including bone morphogenic proteins BMPs Schultheiss et al. 1997 , fibroblast growth factors FGFs Alsan Schultheiss 2002 and Wnt antagonists Schneider Mercola 2001 , to lead to the differentiation into cardiomyocytes . The coordination of events by these signaling pathways is important for the effective gener-ation of functional cardiomyocytes in the embryo . As suggested by previous studies , a possible approach for generating functional cells including cardiomyocytes from hESCs is to reproduce the key events that regulate embryogenesis Murry Keller 2008 . Embryoid body EB formation Kehat et al . report the cardiac potential of these anterior PS cells derived from hESCs . 2001 Xu et al. 2002 He et al. 2003 Satin et al . 2004 Laflamme et al. 2005 and co-cultivation with feeder cells Mummery et al. 2003 have been reported as effective methods for inducing cardio-myocyte differentiation from hESCs . The role of the signaling pathway s involved in the specification of cardiomyocytes from hESCs is largely unknown for any of these methods . It has been shown that Wnt3a or BMP4 alone can induce cardiomyocyte differentia-tion during EB formation Takei et al. 2009 Tran et al. 2009 , but the combined effects of Wnt3a and BMP4 with regard to cardiomyocyte differentiation remain largely undetermined . A recent study demon-strated that the combination of BMP4 , FGF2 , Activin A , vascular endothelial growth factor VEGF and dickkopf homologue 1 DKK1 induced the forma-tion of cardiomyocytes from hESCs Yang et al. 2008 . However , this result leads us to speculate that these cardiomyocytes developed through the forma-tion of the posterior PS , in which BMP signaling is significantly involved . The stepwise process that mimics the cardiac developmental environment via anterior PS formation has yet to be established in hESCs . We previously demonstrated that activation of the canonical Wnt ? b-catenin signaling pathway induced the differentiation of hESCs toward the nascent PS . Furthermore , the simultaneous blockage of BMP signaling by Noggin guided the cell fate toward ante-rior PS progenitors Sumi et al. 2008 . We herein Differentiation into cardiomyocytes from hESCs through anterior PS formation Cardiomyocytes are derived from the mesoderm that migrates through a mid-to-anterior region of the PS during embryogenesis . A successful strategy to obtain functional cardiomyocytes from hESCs would mimic the in vivo embryonic differentiation process . We pre-viously established stable hESC lines constitutively expressing a fusion protein of stabilized b-catenin by the deletion of the glycogen synthase kinase GSK 3 phosphorylation sites and a mutant ligand-binding domain of the estrogen receptor ER Sumi et al. 2008 . This fusion protein is conditionally and revers-ibly activated in response to the ER agonist 4-hydroxy-tamoxifen 4OHT . We observed that b-catenin activation in hESCs resulted in the differen-tiation of the hESCs into PS populations on the induction of BMP signaling . Furthermore , simulta-neous blockage of BMP signaling by Noggin directed the cell fate toward cells with similar properties of the anterior PS in their gene expression behavior Sumi et al. 2008 . In this study , to examine the cardiac differentiation potential of the b-catenin-activated cells with Noggin hereafter referred to as anterior PS cells , we designed a protocol for differentiation of these cells toward a cardiac lineage Fig. 1A . Because the treatment of hESCs for 3 days with 4OHT and Noggin was sufficient to induce the development of anterior PS cells in the previous study , we initially assumed the optimum period of b-catenin activation with Noggin was between 2 and 4 days stage I . After treatment with 4OHT and Noggin for 2�4 days , the cells were dissociated into single cells and cultured in the presence of BMP4 and FGF2 for a further 12 days in low-attachment 96-well plates stage II , 96-well culture method . Because 4OHT treatment through-out stage I reduced the efficiency of cardiomyocyte induction , the cells were cultured with 4OHT and Noggin for first 24 h , and then with only Noggin for additional 1�3 days . Under these conditions , the dissociated cells spontaneously formed aggregates of uniform size , and contracting cells were observed on the surface of the aggregates derived from day 3 and day 4 anterior PS cells Fig. 1D . The frequency of the aggregates containing contracting cells relative to the number of all aggregates observed was indicated as A B D E F the percentage of beating aggregates Fig. 1B . Approximately 30 % of the beating aggregates derived from the day 3 anterior PS cells were observed at day 6 of stage II , and the frequency of beating aggregates reached nearly 90 % at day 12 of stage II . Remarkably , almost all of the day 4 anterior PS cell-derived aggre-gates developed contracting cells at day 6 of stage II . However , no contracting cells were observed in the day 2 anterior PS cell-derived aggregates . We subsequently examined a proportion of cardio-myocytes from these three conditions Fig. 1C . The aggregates cultured under each condition were col-lected randomly at day 12 of stage II and dissociated into single cells before seeding on glass plates for immunostaining . The number of cells stained with anti-a-actinin antibody was counted as a cardiomyo-cyte population . The day 2 anterior PS cell-derived aggregates developed only a small number of a-actinin-positive cardiomyocytes , which was consis-tent with the absence of contracting cells shown in Fig. 1B . The aggregates generated from the day 3 ante-rior PS cells contained 10 % cardiomyocytes , whereas the day 4 anterior PS cell-derived aggregates contained over 20 % cardiomyocytes . These results suggest that the cells with the potential to differentiate into cardiomyo-cytes appeared from day 3 after the activation of b-catenin with Noggin and that the population com-mitted to the cardiac lineage increased between days 3 and 4 . Thereafter , we primarily analyzed cells treated with 4OHT and Noggin for 4 days to obtain a higher number of cardiomyocytes . The emergence of contracting cells in the aggre-gates was first detected on day 8 , and nearly all of the aggregates had developed contracting cells by day 9 Fig. 1D , E . Cell contractions continued for at least 26 days of observation Fig. 1D , Video S1 in Supporting Information . The proportion of cardio-myocytes in the aggregates was subsequently examined in different culture stages Fig. 1F . Approximately 10 % of the cells were a-actinin-positive in the day 10 aggregates , and the number of cells increased approxi-mately threefold by day 26 . In another cell line derived from KhES-1 cells K1DNb-cateninER , all of the aggregates developed contracting cells using a similar 96-well culture method , although the aggregates only generated 10 % cardiomyocytes Fig. S1A , B , G in Sup-porting Information . These observations revealed that hESC lines display variations in their propensity for cardiomyocyte differentiation , as demonstrated previously Osafune et al. 2008 . To evaluate the effect of the concentrations of BMP4 and FGF2 at stage II on the development of cardiomyocytes , the b-catenin-induced cells with Noggin were cultured with different concentrations of BMP4 and FGF2 for a further 12 days at stage II Fig. S2 in Supporting Information . No contracting cells and few a-actinin-positive cardiomyocytes were observed in the aggregates cultured with FGF2 alone or without both BMP4 and FGF2 at stage II . Although contracting cells and a-actinin-positive cells were observed in the aggregates when cultured with BMP4 alone , the aggregates containing cardiomyo-cytes appeared to show poor growth without FGF2 Fig. S2C in Supporting Information . These results indicated that the combined action of BMP4 and FGF2 is required for the effective induction and expansion of cardiomyocytes from hESCs . To obtain the highest number of cardiomyocytes , all experiments were carried out with the same concentrations of 10 ng ? ml BMP4 and 5 ng ? ml FGF . Characterization of the aggregates developing into a cardiac lineage We subsequently investigated the developmental changes in gene expression related to cardiac differenti-ation by RT-PCR analysis Fig. 1G , Fig. S1C in Supporting Information . The expression of POU5F1 , a pluripotent maker gene , was low after day 6 . The expression of T increased at day 4 and disappeared immediately after the addition of BMP4 and FGF2 . Although KDR was expressed in undifferentiated ESCs , the level of expression increased from day 6 and persisted until day 16 . The expression of transcription factor genes associated with cardiac development Olson 2006 , such as TBX5 , MEF2C , ISL1 and NKX2-5 , were up-regulated until day 6 , suggesting that further differentiation into cardiomyocytes was induced immediately after the addition of BMP4 and FGF2 . Increased expression of MYH6 and TNNT2 , which are cardiomyocyte-specific genes , was also detected on day 6 , whereas ACTN2 expression increased between days 6�8 . The expression of genes related to vascular smooth muscle ACTA2 and MYH11 and endothelial devel-opment CDH5 and PECAM1 also increased during cardiac differentiation . An immunostaining analysis revealed the co-expression of Nkx2-5 , a cardiac transcription factor , and a-actinin proteins in aggregates containing contracting cells Fig. 1H , I , thus showing that the a-actinin-positive cells observed in this study were cardiomyocytes and not skeletal muscle . The co-expression of a-actinin and troponin T proteins was also detected in the aggregates , along with cells express-ing SM-MHC , SM-actin or CD31 Fig. 1J�L , Fig. S1D in Supporting Information . The results of the RNA and protein analyses suggested that the b-catenin-activated cells contained not only cardiac but also vascular smooth muscle and endothelial potential . We analyzed the cardiac potential of b-catenin-activated cells induced without Noggin using the same protocol shown in Fig. 1A . Unlike cells treated with 4OHT and Noggin , only 10 % of beating aggregates were observed when treated with 4OHT alone Fig. 2A , Fig. S1E in Supporting Information . This result was consistent with immunostaining results in which very few a-actinin-positive cells were detected in aggregates derived from cells induced with 4OHT only , whereas a-actinin-positive cells were clearly observed in aggregates derived from the 4OHT-and Noggin-treated cells Fig. 2B , Fig. S1F in Supporting Information . We next examined the expression of cardiac genes such as TBX5 , NKX2-5 , MYH6 and ACTN2 by a quantitative RT-PCR analysis . Because the expression of the TBX5 gene reached the highest level on day 8 of culture as shown in Fig. 1G , TBX5 expression was investigated on day 8 of culture . The expression of the other genes including NKX2-5 , MYH6 and ACTN2 was examined at day 16 when cardiomyocyte forma-tion became evident . The results revealed that the expression of all cardiac genes analyzed was down-regulated in the 4OHT-only condition compared to the cells treated with 4OHT and Noggin Fig. 2C . To further confirm the importance of BMP inhibi-tion by Noggin for cardiomyocyte induction , we ana-lyzed the cardiac potential of cells treated with 4OHT in the presence of BMP4 . No beating cells or a-actinin-positive cardiomyocytes were observed in the BMP4-treated cultures Fig. 2A , B . A quantitative RT-PCR analysis showed that the cardiac gene expression was decreased to a similar extent as in the 4OHT-only treated cells . Thus , the cardiac potential was markedly different between the b-catenin-activated populations in the absence or presence of Noggin . These findings support that the blockage of BMP signaling at stage I is crucial for specifying prospective cardiac progenitors , through the forma-tion of the PS induced by b-catenin , suggesting that cardiomyocytes develop from cells that migrate through the anterior region of the PS . The culture method for cardiomyocyte induction using a 96-well plate easily facilitated tracing the kinetics of cardiomyocyte development in each uni-formly sized aggregate . It was not possible to prepare cardiomyocytes with a higher purity and larger scale for detailed functional analysis or therapeutic applica-tions . To address this problem , we devised another strategy to obtain a greater number of purified cardio-myocytes Fig. 3A . After treatment with 4OHT and Noggin at stage I , the cells were dissociated into sin-gle cells and cultured in a low-attachment plate with BMP4 and FGF2 Fig. 3B . The dissociated cells spontaneously formed various sizes of cell masses and developed contracting cell clumps on the surface of each mass Fig. 3C . Because the beating clumps could be separated from large vesicles by brief pipett-ing Fig. 3C , D , the small clumps cardiac aggregates could be collected through a 70-lm cell strainer . After suspension for at least 3 months in a medium E J I We examined whether cardiomyocytes could be induced in genetically unmanipulated hESCs using a GSK3 inhibitor , CHIR99021 Cline et al. 2002 Bain et al. 2007 . After treatment with CHIR99021 and Noggin for 5 days , cells were dissociated , and single cells were cultured in a medium containing BMP4 and FGF2 Fig. 4A . The cells spontaneously formed aggre-gates as is the case of the DNb-cateninER cells . A kinetic analysis of the 96-well culture method revealed contracting cells in 20 % of aggregates beating from day 9 , and all aggregates were contracting at day 10 Fig. 4B , F and Video S3 in Supporting Information . Nearly 20 % of the cells were a-actinin-positive in the aggregates by day 17 Fig . 4G . Immunostaining analy-sis showed co-expression of Nkx2-5 and a-actinin Because cardiomyocytes arise from a distinct mid-to-anterior region , of the PS , inducing the specific portion of the PS from hESCs would be effective for the generation of the cardiomyocytes in vitro . Canoni-cal Wnt ? b-catenin signaling plays a central role in the formation of the PS , whereas the suppression of BMP signaling during the PS formation is involved in cell fate specification of the anterior populations of the PS Tam Loebel 2007 . In this study , we showed that the anterior , but not posterior , PS populations induced by b-catenin activation with Noggin exhibited abun-dant cardiac potential in hESCs . This indicates that the combined manipulations of the canonical Wnt ? b-catenin and BMP signaling pathways are effective for the generation of cardiomyocytes via the anterior PS formation from the hESCs . The effects of both signaling pathways in cardiac development have been supported by in vitro studies using mouse ESCs . These studies demonstrated that the synergistic activation of the canonical Wnt ? b-catenin pathway and inhibition of BMP signaling enhanced cardiac gene expression in vitro Lindsley et al. 2006 furthermore , the tran-sient blockage of BMP signaling by Noggin resulted in effective induction of cardiomyocytes Yuasa et al. 2005 . Other BMP antagonists , including Gremlin and Dorsomorphin , were recently reported to promote cardiomyogenesis in mouse ESCs Hao et al. 2008 Kami et al. 2008 . These studies support our observa-tions that the inhibition of BMP signaling is involved et al. 2010 . The addition of the Wnt protein that activates the Wnt ? b-catenin pathway was thereby expected to replicate the effect of the GSK3 inhibitor in this study . Surprisingly , the cells treated with recombinant Wnt3a protein did not form aggregates at stage II , resulting in a failure to induce cardiomyocytes data not shown . In general , Wnt3a activates Wnt ? b-catenin signaling , leading to accumulation of b-cate-nin protein in the nuclei , where its target genes were activated Willert Jones 2006 MacDonald et al. 2009 . In the cells treated with 4OHT or a GSK3 inhibitor , the expression of b-catenin in the nuclei was clearly observed , whereas in the cells treated with Wnt3a , b-catenin remained to be localized at the cell membrane of almost all of the cells data not shown . These results indicate that the effect of Wnt3a on b-catenin activation is not the same as those of a GSK3 inhibitor under our culture conditions . The duration of CHIR99021 treatment at stage I was critical to obtain sufficient numbers of cardio-myocytes from unmanipulated hESCs . The cells trea-ted with CHIR99021 and Noggin for 4 days only generated 3 % cardiomyocytes data not shown . This result demonstrates that the efficiency of cardiomyo-cyte production was dramatically changed between 4 and 5 days , suggesting that the population committed to the cardiac lineage increased between days 4 and 5 . Meanwhile , the culture period for the cardiac spec-ification was different between unmanipulated hESCs 5 days and DNb-cateninER cells 4 days . These differences might be because of the constitutive expression of stabilized b-catenin-ER , which could allow faster accumulation of b-catenin in the nucleus after 4OHT exposure than would occur in the unma-nipulated hESCs using a GSK3 inhibitor . In this report , we established a novel stepwise devel-opmental method for differentiation of hESCs into a cardiac lineage by the synergistic actions of Wnt ? b-catenin and Noggin , followed by BMP4 and FGF2 . Given that this culture strategy allows tracing of the cardiac embryonic developmental process in the hESCs and production of functional cardiomycoytes by a process mimicking the in vivo process , it will provide valuable opportunities to address some of the important issues about cardiac development . For example , this method can be used to assess how cellular and molecu-lar mechanisms endow the cells with the cardiac lineage fate through the PS formation . Furthermore , this approach will also be useful in the field of chemi-cal screening for small molecules on cardiomyocyte differentiation , and also for the pharmacological testing for drug-induced long QT syndrome . Experimental procedures Maintenance and differentiation of hESCs The use of hES cell lines was conducted in accordance with �The Guidelines for Derivation and Utilization of Human Embryonic Stem Cells 2001 � of the Ministry of Education , Culture , Sports , Science and Technology , Japan , after approval of the Institutional Review Board . The hESC lines , KhES-1 and KhES-3 , which constitutively expressed a fusion protein of stabilized b-catenin and a mutant ligand-binding domain of the ER , were obtained and maintained as described previously Suemori et al. 2006 Sumi et al. 2008 . For the differentiation of hESCs , the cells were dissociated into small clumps and cultured on dishes coated with matrigel BD Biosciences , San Jose , CA , USA in mouse embryonic fibroblast MEF -condi-tioned medium with 5 ng ? mL recombinant human FGF2 Wako Pure Chemical Industries Ltd , Osaka , Japan . From the next day referred to as day 0 of culture , the cells were cul-tured in N2B27 medium with 100 nM 4OHT Sigma-Aldrich , St Louis , MO , USA , 10 ng ? mL recombinant human BMP4 R D Systems , Minneapolis , MN , USA and ? or 100 ng ? ml recombinant human Noggin ? Fc Chimera R D Systems Sumi et al. 2008 . In the case of KhES-3 cells , after 4OHT treatment with BMP4 or Noggin for the first 24 h , the 4OHT was washed out of the cells with DMEM ? F12 supplemented with N2B27 , and thereafter the cells were trea-ted with BMP4 or Noggin only until the end of culturing at stage I . In the case of KhES-1 cells , the cells were treated with 4OHT and Noggin throughout all 4 days of culture at stage I . The medium was changed every day . For the genera-tion of aggregates at stage II , cells treated with 4OHT were trypsinized , seeded at a density of 10,000 cells per well in a Celltight Spheroid 96-well round bottom plate Sumitomo Bakelite Co. Ltd , Tokyo , Japan and cultured in RPMI1640 medium Invitrogen supplemented with fetal bovine serum 0.5 % FBS , L-glutamine 2 mM , L-ascorbic acid 2 mM , nicotinamide 10 mM , dexamethasone 0.1 lM , 1 � Insulin-Transferrin-Selenium-G supplement Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA , USA , sodium pyruvate 1 mM , BMP4 10 ng ? mL and FGF2 5 ng ? mL . For differentiation of an unmanipulated ESC line KhES-3 , CHIR99021 Stemgent , San Diego , CA , USA was used at a final concentration of 6 lM with 100 ng ? mL Noggin for the first 5 days of stage I . Thereafter , the CHIR99021-treated cells were differentiated into a cardiac lineage under the same culture conditions as those described earlier . Isolation of cardiac aggregates For isolation of cardiac aggregates , the 4OHT-or CHIR99021-treated cells were trypsinized and cultured for an additional 8 days in a 6-well ultra-low-attachment plate Corning , Lowell , MA , USA in the same medium that was used for the aggregate culture as shown earlier at a density of 1 � 106 cells per well . Cell aggregates in the population , which were approximately 70 lm and greater in size , were collected by passing them through a 70-lm cell strainer Becton , Dickinson and Company , Franklin Lakes , NJ , USA . Cardiac aggregates were separated from the noncardiac aggregates by brief pipetting and were collected through a new 70-lm cell strainer . These cells were subsequently cultured with the same medium for stage II . For immunostaining analysis , the cardiac aggregates were seeded on glass chamber plates and fixed in 4 % paraformaldehyde PFA for 15 min the next day . Total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Micro Kit QIA-GEN , Valencia , VA , USA and reverse-transcribed using the Omniscript RT Kit QIAGEN according to the manufacturer�s instructions . Semi-quantitative RT-PCR was carried out using Ex-Taq Polymerase Takara Biotechnology , Tokyo , Japan . Quantitative RT-PCR was carried out using SYBR Green RT-PCR reagents Applied Biosystems , Foster City , CA , USA and an ABI PRISM 7500 Sequence Detection System Applied Biosystems according to the manufacturer�s protocols . The relative amount of each gene was normalized against GAPDH using the comparative threshold cycle CT method . The data represent the means � standard deviation from three independent experiments . The expression level of each gene in the 4OHT-only treated samples was defined as 1.0 . Details of the primers used for the semi-quantitative and quantitative RT-PCR are shown in Table S1 in Supporting Information . Immunofluorescence analysis Aggregates were fixed in 4 % PFA for 1 h on ice , washed in PBS and soaked in 15 % sucrose for 1 h on ice . After being embedded in O.C.T. compound Sakura Finetek USA Inc. , Torrance , CA , USA , samples were sectioned at a thickness of 7 lm . To count the number of cardiomyocytes in the aggre-gates , the aggregates were treated with 1 mg ? ml collagenase Invitrogen in DMEM ? F12 for 1 h and then incubated in TrypLE Select Invitrogen for 10 min with gentle shaking in a 37 �C , 5 % CO2 incubator . The dissociated cells were cultured on glass bottom dishes for 24 h , then fixed in 4 % PFA for 15 min . Immunostaining was carried out as described previously Yamauchi et al. 2009 . Fluorescence was observed using a Zeiss fluorescence microscope Carl Zeiss , Vertrieb , Deutschland . The following primary antibodies were used for the immunofluorescence analysis rabbit anti-Nkx2-5 H-114 , 1 50 Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Inc . Santa Cruz , CA , USA , mouse anti-a-actinin EA-53 , 1 800 Sigma-Aldrich , mouse anti-heavy chain cardiac myosin MHC , 1 200 Abcam , Cambridge , UK , mouse anti-cardiac troponinT 1 100 Abcam , mouse anti-smooth muscle actin SM-actin , 1 200 Sigma-Aldrich , mouse anti-smooth muscle myosin heavy chain SM-MHC , 1 200 Dako , Glostrup , Denmark , mouse anti-CD31 1 100 R D Systems , mouse anti-VE-cadherin 1 100 R D Systems , rabbit anti-connexin43 1 50 Cell Signaling Tech-nology Inc. , Danvers , MA and rabbit anti-HCN4 1 50 Alamone Labs Ltd , Jerusalem , Israel . AlexaFluor 488 - , 546 - , 555-or 647-conjugated secondary antibodies were purchased from Invitrogen . For whole-cell patch-clamp recording , cardiac aggregates on days 95�103 of culture were dissociated into single cells using the same protocol described earlier and cultured for 4�7 days on matrigel-or gelatin-coated cover glasses Matsunami Glass Ind. Ltd , Osaka , Japan . Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were carried out using a HEKA EPC10 amplifier HEKA Instruments Inc. , Bellmore , NY , USA . The external solution contained 140 mM NaCl , 5 mM KCl , 10 mM HEPES , 2 mM CaCl2 , 1 mM MgCl2 and 10 mM glucose and was adjusted to pH 7.2 with NaOH . The pipette solution contained 80 mM K-aspartate , 50 mM KCl , 1 mM MgCl2 , 10 mM EGTA , 3 mM ATP-Mg and 10 mM HEPES and was adjusted to pH 7.2 with KOH . The current�voltage relationship was obtained by holding the membrane potential at 40 to 90 mV and then delivering a depolarizing pulse for 500 ms in a stepwise manner with 10 mV increments from 50 to 140 mV for HCN currents known as If in the heart . The cardiac aggregates on day 38�49 of culture , and undiffer-entiated ESCs , were injected directly into the testes of SCID mice . For the immunostaining analysis , testes were collected at 8 weeks after the surgery and fixed in 4 % PFA for 3 h at 4 �C , washed three times in PBS and soaked in 30 % sucrose-PBS for 24 h at 4 �C . Thereafter , the tissues were immersed in a 1 1 mixture of 30 % sucrose and OCT for 2 h at room temperature and were embedded in OCT . The sam-ples were sectioned at a thickness of 7 lm , and an immuno-staining analysis was carried out . To detect transplanted hES cell-derived cardiomyocytes in the mice , the following primary antibodies were used mouse anti-a-actinin or mouse anti-human nuclei antibody 1 400 Millipore , Billerica , MA , USA . For the immunostaining analysis , testes were collected at 8 weeks after the surgery . Statistical significance was evaluated by Student�s t-test . The number of aggregates that contained contracting cells relative to the total number of aggregates n 96 is shown as the per-centage of beating aggregates . The number of a-actinin-posi-tive cells relative to the total number of nuclei n 1000 stained with DAPI is indicated as the percentage of a-actinin-positive cells . All values on the graphs are presented as the means � standard error of the mean SEM of three indepen-dent experiments .

21052094	For activation of resting T cells , two signals are required . The first signal emerges from an engagement of the T cell receptor TCR CD3 complex , whereas the second signal is generated through the ligation of co-stimulatory receptors i.e . CD28 . Recently , �tumor necrosis factor TNF receptor-associated factor� TRAF binding receptors were identified as a second class of co-stimulatory receptors.1 As an example , Alderson et al.2,3 provided first evidence for the role of CD95 Fas , APO-1 , the prototypic death receptor of the immune system , in the activation of human T cells . It was subsequently reported that CD3-crosslinking alone or CD3 CD95 co-stimulation induces the processing of caspase-8 and or caspase-3 as a prerequisite for full T-cell proliferation.4�6 CD95 co-ligation also influences several other routes of intracellular signal transduction . Kataoka et al.7 reported the activation of NF-kB-and mitogen-activated protein kinase MAPK -related pathways following an interaction of CD95-recruited �cellular FLICE-inhibitory protein� cFLIP with down-stream signaling molecules . Apparently , this process required the cleavage of cFLIP into a p43 fragment . More recently , however , it was argued that p22-FLIP but not p43 can activate NF-kB by directly interacting with the IKK complex.8 So far , three cFLIP isoforms cFLIPL , cFLIPS and cFLIPR were identified , with cFLIPS mediating a block in apoptosis R www.nature.com cdd by inhibiting procaspase-8 at the death-inducing signaling complex DISC . The role of cFLIPL regarding an inhibition at the DISC is still a matter of debate.8,9 Further downstream , antiapoptotic proteins including Bcl-2 Bcl-XL and �X-linked inhibitor-of-apoptosis protein� XIAP may prevent apopto-sis.9,10 A decreased expression of antiapoptotic check-point proteins in CD95-sensitive cells could therefore shift NF-kB-associated proliferative signaling pathways to cas-pase-associated death signaling in the course of cellular activation.11 We now report that CD95 engagement modulates the activation of primary human CD4 ? T cells in a dose-dependent manner . Whereas high concentrations of CD95 agonists result in the block of activation , low concentrations augment TCR-induced proliferation . As this differential signaling capacity was seen for different ligands , it points to a novel mechanism to regulate T-cell activation in a context-specific manner . In addition to the inhibitory effect recently described by Strauss et al.12 we provide a detailed analysis of signaling events associated with the positive co-stimulatory function of CD95 . We demonstrate that CD95 ligation with low doses of agonists promotes TCR-triggered MAPK phosphorylation , non-apoptotic caspase activation , and the upregulation of activation markers and antiapoptotic checkpoint proteins . As a consequence , enhanced cell-cycle progression , proliferation and cytokine production are asso-ciated with a generalized partial apoptosis resistance . Results Modulation of primary T-cell activation by CD95 engagement . To analyze the effects of CD95 ligation on the TCR CD3 CD28-induced activation of freshly isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells PBMCs , we initially immobilized anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody mAb ? anti-CD28 mAb in the presence or absence of CD95LFc , huIgGFc or agonistic anti-CD95 mAb 7C11 . As shown in Figure 1a , TCR-induced proliferation was significantly reduced in the presence of CD95LFc , but augmented in the presence of anti-CD95 mAb . Immobilization was mandatory to modulate T-cell activation , as soluble factors had no effect not shown . Moreover , stimulation by co-immobilized anti-CD28 mAb did not alter the outcome . When we analyzed purified CD4 ? T cells Figure 1b�d , we observed an almost complete block of TCR-induced cluster or blast formation and proliferation in the presence of CD95LFc , but a massive activation using anti-CD95 mAb anti-APO-1 . The CFSE profiles indicated that upon CD3 CD28 stimulation , anti-CD95 co-ligation induced cell-cycle progression in the entire population , whereas in the absence of anti-CD95 significantly fewer cells divided . Importantly , neither immobilized CD95LFc nor immobilized anti-CD95 mAb induced significant cell death of resting T cells during the observation period Figure 1e . Dose-dependent effects of CD95 co-ligation . As the effects of immobilized CD95 agonists were seen at coating concentrations of 20�40 mg ml for fusion proteins and 2�5 mg ml for mAb , we wondered whether the co-stimulatory function would depend on the dose of agonists . To test this , CD4 ? T cells were stimulated with anti-CD3 CD28 in the absence or presence of CD95 agonists that were co-immobilized at various concentrations . T-cell activation was monitored by the expression of CD25 and CD69 at d1 Figure 2 . Although CD95LFc , CD95L-ST-Fc , LZ-CD95L and anti-APO-1 at high concentrations inhibited the expression of both activation markers , lower amounts of agonists led to an increased number of CD25 CD69 double-positive cells . This dose-dependency was seen for all ligands tested , although the degree of inhibition and stimulation varied to some extent between individual donors . Of note , the apoptosis-inducing capacity of all CD95 reagents was confirmed using pre-activated phytohemagglutinin PHA blasts and soluble agonists Supplementary Figure S1 . In addition , as exemplified for LZ-CD95L , at the tested concentrations , soluble CD95 ligands alone only mildly affect the viability of the freshly isolated CD4 ? T-cell population . CD95 co-stimulation augments TCR-induced cytokine production . Co-immobilization of anti-CD95 augmented the production of IL-2 , interferon gamma IFNg and TNFa , but hardly influenced the level of IL-4 Figure 3 . As expected , IL-2 production depended on CD3 stimulation and was further enhanced by CD28 co-stimulation Figure 3a . CD95 ligation alone had no effect . In the presence of anti-CD95 , CD3-stimulated T cells initially produced less IL-2 compared to CD3 CD28-triggered cells . However , higher levels of IL-2 were detected at d2 3 by ELISA , and also by intracellular FACS staining Supplementary Figure S2A . To document the strong co-stimulatory capacity of CD95 irres-pective of the used agonist , the data were verified by co-stimulation with low amounts of CD95LFc Supplementary Figure S2B . In line with the growth inhibition at high doses of CD95LFc , also the IL-2 production was reduced compared to CD3-stimulated cells Supplementary Figure S2B . The presence of exogenous IL-2 hardly affected the activation-induced CD25 expression Figure 3b and Supplementary Figure S2C , arguing that the CD3 28 95-induced IL-2 production sufficed for optimal initiation of T-cell activation . Also , the CD3 CD28-induced production of IFNg and TNFa was significantly enhanced in the presence of low doses of anti-CD95 Figure 3c . As shown in Supplementary Figure S3A , similar results were obtained using low versus high doses of other agonists , for example , CD95L-ST-Fc . Notably , IL-4 production was almost unchanged , indicating a more pronounced effect of CD95 ligation on T helper 1 Th1 -type cells . Consistent with this , T-bet , a known regulator of Th1 differentiation , was upregulated and phosphorylation of STAT-1 and STAT-4 was enhanced only in the presence of low-dose anti-CD95 Figure 3d or CD95L-ST-Fc Supplementary Figure S3B . CD95 affects the expression of activation markers and TCR-associated signaling pathways . As shown in Figure 4 and Supplementary Figure S4 , starting at 2�4 h of incubation , CD69 expression on CD3 - , CD3 CD28-or PHA-stimulated CD4 ? T cells was higher in the presence of low doses of anti-CD95 or CD95L-ST-Fc . A sustained high level of CD69 following co-stimulation with low dose of anti-CD95 Figure 4b or CD95L-ST-Fc Supplementary Figures S5 , S6 and S7 was detected at d2 3 , along with massive increases of other activation markers including OX-40 CD134 , IL-2Ra CD25 , IL-2Rb CD122 , cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4 CTLA-4 CD152 and CD95L CD178 . In contrast , high doses of CD95L-ST-Fc completely blocked activation Supplementary Figures S6 and S7 . When comparing CD3-stimulated and CD3 CD95-stimu-lated cells regarding the kinetics of extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase ERK phosphorylation , we did not observe major differences in short-term cultures up to 30 min . However , whereas ERK phosphorylation of TCR CD3-trig-gered cells was transient and declined thereafter , in the presence of anti-CD95 , we detected a prolonged phosphory-lation for up to 48 h Figure 4c . This enhanced ERK activation was also seen for low-dose CD95L-ST-Fc Supplementary Figure S8 . In this scenario , treatment with the ERK1 2 inhibitor PD 98059 PD significantly blocked cell activation and proliferation Figure 4e , Supplementary Figure S9 in the absence of cell death Supplementary Figure S9A , indicating that ERK signal transduction is crucial for the antiapoptotic CD95-mediated co-stimulatory capacity . In contrast , and in line with the report by Strauss et al. , 12 T cells co-incubated with high concentrations of CD95 agonists showed a anti-CD3 28 CD25 CD25 CD25 CD25 anti-CD3 28 + CD95LFc 20 g ml 10 g ml 63,1 67,69 anti-CD3 28 + CD95L-ST-Fc 20 g ml 10 g ml 62,04 62,69 53,95 anti-CD3 28 + LZ-CD95L 6,37 45,84 51,22 anti-CD3 28 + anti-CD95 80 g ml 40 g ml 79,68 76,28 5 [ rel . drastically reduced ERK phosphorylation already within the first minutes Figure 4d and still at d2 of incubation Supplementary Figure S8A . Notably , T-cell activation induced by phorbolester PMA and calcium ionophore ionomycin was not affected by CD95 ligation , neither at high nor at low concentrations Figure 4f . anti-CD95 anti-CD3 anti-CD3 PBS CD95 crosslinking enhances TCR internalization . TCR CD3 complex internalization is associated with optimal activation through the formation of intracellular signaling platforms.13 As shown in Figure 5a and b and Supple-mentary Figure S10A , B , FACS analyses revealed a signi-ficant augmentation of CD3-driven TCR internalization by cell 4 h 6 h 8 h 15 15 25 0 PBS 95 anti-CD3 anti-CD95 anti-CD3 1 h 12 h PBS anti-CD3 CD95L-ST-Fc CD95L-ST-Fc 48 h PBS PBS anti-CD3 anti-CD3 anti-CD3 anti-CD95 CD95L-ST-Fc Ionomycin CD95LFc anti-CD95 low-dose CD95 co-stimulation within the first 8 h of incubation , and even more pronounced after 48 h . At the same time , CD69 expression was upregulated , indicating that CD95 crosslinking selectively down-modulated TCR surface availability Supplementary Figure S10B . 200 [ MFI ] TCR CD95 triggering is associated with receptor internalization . Also for members of the TNF receptor TNFR superfamily , receptor internalization has been asso-ciated with the generation of intracellular signaling platforms . In case of TNFR1 or CD95 , internalized receptosomes contain several pro-apoptotic molecules.14 To test whether CD95 internalization might also be associated with non-apoptotic CD95 signaling , we analyzed CD95 surface expression following stimulation Figure 5c�e , Supple-mentary Figure S10C . In the absence of CD3 stimulation , low-dose CD95 ligation reduced CD95 surface availability without affecting T-cell activation . Although TCR or mitogen activation of resting T cells was associated with an upregulation of CD95 , this increased expression was significantly counter-regulated in the presence of anti-CD95 Supplementary Figure S10C . Importantly , CD69 expression followed the patterns described before Figure 5d . Using a set of inhibitors for metalloproteases GM6001 , TAPI , clathrin-dependent endocytosis monodansyl cadaverine , microtubule colchicine and actin polymerization cytochalasin D CytD , latrunculin A LatA , we observed a dose-dependent reduction of CD95 internalization only in the presence of CytD and LatA Figure 5e , indicating that an actin-dependent mechanism might control this process . Because of the inhibition of actin polymerization , we observed a complete block of CD3 CD28-driven T-cell proliferation Supplementary Figure S10D without detectable cell death Supplementary Figure S10E . Thus , we suggest that abolished CD95 internalization results in T-cell silencing . CD95 co-stimulation induces caspase activity and expression of antiapoptotic proteins . To address whether CD95-triggered caspase activity would also contribute to TCR-induced activation , we analyzed caspase processing and activity Figure 6 . In line with earlier reports , 4�6,10,15 increased caspase-3 -8 activities were detected in lysates of TCR-stimulated cells , and caspase activity was further enhanced by co-stimulation with anti-CD28 or low amounts of anti-CD95 or CD95LFc . The importance of active caspases in this scenario was illustrated by the addition of the pan-caspase inhibitor ZVAD-fmk . Caspase inhibition resulted in a drastic reduction of CD25 expression and inhibited proliferation without provoking apoptosis Supplementary Figure S11 . Interestingly , caspase activation during positive CD95 co-stimulation was even higher than the activity seen in apoptotic Jurkat T cells Figure 6a , lower panels . In contrast , CD95 ligation using CD95LFc at high concentrations completely blocked caspase activation in resting cells . Positive CD95 co-stimulation significantly increased the level of cleaved caspase-3 p20 Figure 6b and c . As shown in Figure 6c , the partial caspase-3 processing was associated with an increase of active caspase-8 p41 p43 . Although the p20 product of caspase-3 and the p41 p43 intermediates of caspase-8 seem to be capable of cleaving the fluorogenic caspase-3 -8 substrates , we did not observe a significant cleavage of apoptosis-associated substrates i.e. , PARP , phospholipase Cg PLCg . Therefore , pro-and antiapoptotic caspase signaling might depend on a differential processing of caspase-3 . Taken together , we show that activation of primary T cells correlates with caspase processing and in vitro caspase activity . Apoptotic death receptor signaling can be intrinsically regulated at several levels by cFLIPR , p43-and p22-FLIP S as well as antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family members like Bcl-XL . As illustrated in Figure 6d , TCR stimulation resulted in a mild upregulation of Bcl-XL , cFLIPR and p22-FLIP . Low-dose S anti-APO-1 co-ligation strongly enhanced the expression of all antiapoptotic proteins that were tested Figure 6d . As NF-kB activation is linked to cFLIP signaling , we also observed enhanced phosphorylation of IkB . Upregulation of cFLIPR S , Bcl-XL and activation of NF-kB are associated with cell survival . Therefore , we asked whether CD95 co-stimulated cells also display apoptosis resistance to other stimuli . Upon TCR stimulation and more pronounced upon co-stimulation by CD95 , we indeed observed a partial apoptosis resistance when the pretreated cells were collected at d2 , and either g-irradiated or exposed to toxic mistletoe lectin16 Figure 6e . Accelerated cell-cycle progression of TCR-stimulated cells by low-dose CD95 co-ligation . We next addressed whether CD95 co-stimulation influences cell-cycle progression during primary T-cell activation Figure 7 . Although anti-CD95 alone did not influence the cell-cycle profile , CD3 and CD3 28 stimulation resulted in the expected mild increase of cells within the S-or G2 M-phase . Co-stimulation by anti-CD95 , however , resulted in a massive induction of proliferation with 45 % of the cells entering S-and G2 M-phase in the absence , and 55 % in the presence of anti-CD28 . In this study , the co-stimulatory capacity of anti-CD95 was even stronger than the anti-CD28-induced co-stimulation . The differential effect of low versus high dose of agonists on cell-cycle progression was confirmed using the CD95L-ST-Fc fusion protein Supplementary Figure S12 . Similarly , when the T cells were analyzed for the production of ATP , low amounts of CD95L-ST-Fc elevated ATP levels , while high ligand concentrations reduced the anti-CD3 CD28-induced ATP production Supplementary Figure S12D . At the level of protein expression , we analyzed the appearance of cell-cycle-regulating proteins at d2 . Compared to the unchanged level of ERK , all tested cell-cycle-regulating proteins , including CDKs , cyclins and proliferating cell nuclear antigen PCNA see also Supplementary Figure S8A for low versus high dose of CD95L-ST-Fc and phosphorylated retinoblastoma Rb protein , were induced to much higher levels in anti-CD95 co-stimulated cells Figure 7 . scence 2 CD95 was originally identified as the prototypic death receptor in and outside the immune system . More recently , it emerged 95 95 40 0 PBS 95 PBS 95 PBS 95 PBS 95 PBS 95 anti-CD3 anti-CD3 anti-CD3 anti-CD3 anti-CD3 anti-CD3 anti-CD3 anti-CD3 anti-CD3 anti-CD3 G1 S apo apo apo 6 76 8 10 9 37 30 25 9 90 0.5 1 [ % ] PBS anti-CD95 anti-CD95 anti-CD95 anti-CD3 anti-CD3 as a dual-function signaling receptor that can give rise to pro-and antiapoptotic signals depending on the cellular microenvironment.2 We now show that CD95 also functions as a dual-function modulator during TCR CD3-initiated activation of primary human T cells . The outcome of CD95 ligation on na ? ve � T cells largely depends on the �dose of agonist� , resulting in opposite effects from a complete block of activation at high doses to a prominent co-stimulatory activation at lower concentrations . In our report , we focus on the growth-promoting function of CD95 on human CD4 ? T cells . In essence , CD95 co-stimulation is only seen in the context of TCR CD3 stimulation , does not require an additional signal e.g. through CD28 , and strictly depends on immobilization of the CD95 agonists . Antiapoptotic or co-stimulatory consequences of CD95 engagement have been described for different cell types during liver regeneration , neurite outgrowth , development and functional recovery of the central nervous system , and proliferation of growth factor deprived fibroblasts.17 Also , for T lymphocytes , earlier work pointed to a potential modulation of T-cell activation by CD95.3,4 However , the molecular mechanisms of this co-stimulatory function have never been elucidated . Recently , Strauss et al.12,18 reported that CD95 co-stimulation blocks the activation of na ? ve � T cells by inhibiting TCR signaling . This is in line with our observations using high concentrations of CD95 agonists , and thus reflects the inhibitory branch of CD95 signaling . As the effective concentrations of antigen-presenting cell APC -expressed or plate-bound agonists in the two studies are difficult to correlate , we suggest a narrow threshold window for switching the response from full activation to silencing supported by our titration experiments . Notably , as for most analyses employ-ing primary human T cells , we also observed donor-related variations of the fraction of co-stimulated cells and the signal amplitude . A dose-dependency of CD95 ligation was noted earlier for CD95-sensitive SKW6.4 cells.19 Also in this study , CD95 stimulation below a certain threshold level triggered survival , whereas strong CD95 stimulation initiated cell death . However , in contrast to SKW6.4 cells or activated T cells , freshly isolated T cells display apoptosis resistance even to high concentrations of CD95 agonists . As a consequence , high concentrations rather interfere with TCR signal initiation , and ultimately result in T-cell silencing without inducing cell death . In contrast , low concentrations promote a sustained amplification of various TCR-induced activation parameters , including receptor internalization , ERK phosphorylation , expression of antiapoptotic proteins or activation markers , and cell-cycle progression . For both TCR and CD95 signal initiation , receptor endocytosis has been implicated in the formation of respec-tive signaling platforms important for cellular activation.14,20 Although the exact mechanisms of TCR internalization are still poorly understood , it in part depends on clathrin-mediated endocytosis.13 Our observations suggest that low-dose CD95 engagement enhances the TCR translocation . However , it is still unclear how this mechanistically relates to CD95 endocytosis and to the generation of a common growth-promoting signaling platform . Notably , an ezrin-dependent route of internalization was recently described to counteract cell death induction and promote antiapoptotic functions of CD95.21 Interestingly in this context , in contrast to CD95-mediated cell death induction , CD95 localization in raft nanodomains has very recently been shown to be dispen-sable for non-apoptotic CD95 internalization and signaling.22 Our own analyses suggest an accelerated actin-dependent CD95 TCR co-internalization as a mechanism to establish receptor interference and signaling crosstalk . MAPKs such as ERK are regarded as key switches of cellular activation and proliferation . In the context of low-dose co-stimulatory CD95 signaling , we observed a prolonged ERK phosphorylation . ERK activation in response to non-apoptotic CD95 triggering was reported before for glioma cells23 and fibroblasts.11 Moreover , in primary murine T cells , stimulation with anti-CD3 CD95 caused an ERK-dependent induction of AP-1-dependent luciferase activity.24 Notably , TCR silencing in the presence of high amounts of CD95L is associated with a complete inhibition of CD3 CD28-mediated ERK activation.12 Circumventing TCR ligation with phorbolester and calcium ionophore indicates that CD95 ligation affects TCR signaling upstream or independent of calcium mobilization and PKC activation . Although caspase activation is a hallmark of apoptosis , 9 it has also been associated with lymphocyte activation.4,15,25 We indeed detected elevated caspase-3 -8 activities in lysates of proliferating T cells . Co-ligation of CD28 or CD95 led to a comparable increase in caspase activity in this in vitro assay , again indicating that low-dose CD95 co-stimulation might in fact replace CD28 signaling . In agreement with Strauss et al. , 12 CD95 agonists at high concentrations blocked caspase activity in the same assay . As pro-apoptotic caspase substrates were never cleaved , we suggest that caspase activation is required for proliferation , but that non-or pro-apoptotic caspase activation is qualitatively different.15 In the case of the effector caspase-3 , we only observed the formation of the p20 cleavage fragment , but not of p17 p19 , which is found in apoptotic cells . In view of our recent observation that XIAP can interact with caspase-3 and thereby blocks full caspase activation , 10 we suggest that in na ? ve � T cells , CD95 initiates an incomplete cleavage of caspase-3 , thereby presumably hindering the cleavage of pro-apoptotic substrates . Thus , mitogenic caspase-3 activa-tion might affect a different subset of substrates , which in turn are crucial for mounting a proliferative response . None-theless , it is still a matter of debate whether CD95 directly activates caspases via its adapter molecule FADD or whether CD95 only supports the TCR-mediated activation of caspases mediated by a signaling complex formed by Bcl-10 , CARMA1 and MALT1.26 Given that cFLIPR and the Bcl-2 family member Bcl-XL are S known for their capacity to protect from apoptotic cell death , 9 we observed a more generalized apoptosis resistance after TCR activation and co-stimulation by CD95 . The crucial role of antiapoptotic proteins was underscored by the fact that ABT737 , an inhibitor of antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family members , abolished CD3 CD95-mediated apoptosis resis-tance not shown . In this context , it has also been noted that antiapoptotic FLIP isoforms do not just block the initiation of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway , but also result in increased survival after TCR engagement and protect from spontaneous apoptosis.27 It was proposed that the expression of CD95L on APC would be responsible for antigen-specific deletion of primed peripheral T cells , eventually leading to T-cell tolerance or immunosuppression.28,29 More recent data , however , provide evidence for alternate activities of APC-associated CD95L on na ? ve � T cells , including the complete block of T-cell activation in the absence of apoptosis and proliferation.12,28 This is in line with an earlier report by Chen et al. , 30 who observed an inhibition of T-cell proliferation by �CD95L-painted� K562 B7-1 cells that was only partially caused by apoptosis induction . However , in this study , a positive co-stimulatory effect of CD95L had not been noted . On B cells31 and APC , 32 CD95L might be upregulated in the course of an immune response by yet unknown mechanisms accompanying antigen processing and presentation.32 It was suggested that macrophages upregulate CD95L during HIV infection33 and thereby contribute to the apoptotic depletion of uninfected CD4 ? T cells . According to the report by Strauss et al. , 12 another mechanism of reducing T-cell numbers might be the proliferation block of resting cells . Apparently , the outcome of CD95 ligation very much depends on the state of activation of the respective T-cell population . Also , CD95L-expressing dendritic cells DCs trigger apoptosis of pre-activated cells , but induce resistance or even proliferation of na ? ve � T cells.28,34 Under pathophysiological conditions , increased levels of CD95L might prevent initial T-cell expansion . Respective scenarios have been reported for HIV , 12 CMV35 and others . In fact , Raftery et al.35 observed that CMV-infected DCs not only down-modulate MHC molecules , but also upregulate CD95L , thereby inducing cell death of activated T cells and non-deletional suppression of the surviving T cells . In conclusion , we suggest that , under physiological condi-tions , low-level CD95L on APC positively co-stimulates na ? ve� T cells , allowing a first phase of expansion . During the immune response , CD95L is upregulated on APC and results in immune response termination by inducing apoptosis in pre-activated cells , and preventing the activation of additional effector cells . Under pathophysiological conditions , the threshold levels might be shifted to higher expression of CD95L , as a mechanism of immune evasion of certain pathogens .

21052096	Perturbations of the precise space�time coordination of cell-cycle events lead to genomic instability causing cancerous growth or death of progeny cells.1 Cancer cells illegitimately pass through tightly controlled cell-cycle transitions and gain a selective growth advantage over normal cells . Although strict regulation of centrosome duplication and inheritance is pivotal to the correct execution of cell division , centrosome amplifica-tion , either due to the deregulated centrosome duplication or cytokinetic failure , frequently occurs in cancer cells and correlates with chromosomal instability . Microtubule-binding drugs also produce abnormalities in centriole structure and centrosome duplication2 in response to cell-cycle arrest3 or because of damaged or incompletely replicated DNA during mitosis.4 Interestingly , Drosophila and vertebrate cells in culture harboring extra centrosomes initially form multipolar spindles in early mitosis , 5 but eventually divide bipolarly yielding division-competent progeny . The extra centrosomes cluster at two dominant spindle poles and or become progressively inactivated.6�8 However , in cells in which extra centrosomes failed to cluster , the resulting multipolar division invariably produced inviable progeny . These observations have raised the possibility that induction of spindle multipolarity could be a potential chemotherapeutic strategy . Anti-tubulin agents , such as taxanes and vincas are extensively used for clinical treatment of human malignan-cies.9 However , they either overpolymerize taxanes or depolymerize microtubules and form paracrystals vincas , thereby impairing crucial microtubule functions and causing devastating toxicities.9 Noscapinoids represent a novel class of microtubule-modulating agents that avoid the harsher effects of currently available tubulin-binding chemotherapeu-tics by preserving the total polymer mass of tubulin.10�12 The parent molecule , noscapine , a plant-derived antitussive alkaloid , is in Phase I II clinical trials for treatment of multiple myeloma . In silico molecular modeling efforts to rationally design and chemically synthesize better noscapine analogs have led to the identification of more potent noscapine derivatives.13�15 In particular , 9�bromonoscapine EM011 binds tubulin with greater affinity than noscapine , and is effective even against drug-resistant xenograft tumors without any detectable toxicity.16�20 Therefore , noscapine and its analogs are known as �kinder and gentler� microtubule-modulating agents.21 EM011 treatment causes a G2 M arrest in cancer cells followed by apoptotic cell death.16�22 However , the relation-ship between mitotic-block and cell death has remained elusive . In order to understand EM011�s mode of action , we examined how this drug induces perturbations in the coordination of mitotic events causing cell-cycle stasis , and then tips the outcomes in favor of cell death rather than continued , increasingly aberrant and aggressive proliferation . We determined the EM011�s effects on cell-cycle progression and spindle biogenesis and analyzed how it induces apoptosis . Our data show that EM011 treatment reduces microtubule dynamicity and deregulates the centrosome duplication cycle , causing centrosome amplification and spindle multipolarity . Spindle multipolarity in turn , produces multiple catastrophic cellular outcomes , culminating in apop-tosis induction . Results EM011 preserves microtubule ultrastructure . Error-free mitotic progression requires precise regulation of microtubule dynamics . As both microtubule-stabilizing and -destabilizing agents suppress spindle dynamics , 23,24 we first asked whether EM011 mediates cytotoxicity by perturbing dynamic instability of interphase microtubules in living GFP-tubulin expressing MCF-7 cells Supplementary Movie-1 control and Movie-2 treated , time-lapse movies . In contrast to control cells in which microtubules alternated between phases of growth and shortening , with intervening �pause� phases , EM011 treatment attenuated microtubule dynamics as indicated by largely unaltered position of microtubule ends at the cell periphery Figure 1ai . Figure 1aii shows life-history traces of microtubules from control and treated cells . Supplementary Table 1 shows quantitative analysis of microtubule growth , shortening , frequencies of catastrophe and rescue and average duration of pause phase . We found that EM011 reduced overall dynamicity by B72 % and increased pause duration by B76 % . Thus EM011 decreases the number of dynamic events in the life history of a microtubule without affecting its long-term existence . Unlike taxanes and vincas that often exert extreme effects on microtubules , EM011 preserves the monomer polymer ratio of tubulin at concentrations as high as 100 mM.11,13 Using immunofluorescence confocal microscopy and transmission electron microscopy , we found that EM011 did neither perturb the radial-array of microtubules nor their ultrastructural morphology in interphase cells , compared with vehicle-treated cells Figure 1b . In contrast , 0.01 mM paclitaxel overpolymerized microtubules and bundled them into con-tinuous sheets Figure 1b . Hence , EM011 treatment merely dampened microtubule dynamics without causing any detect-able structural changes to the microtubule cytoskeleton . EM011 modulates microtubule dynamics by affecting microtubule plus-end proteins . Changes in microtubule dynamicity are generated by microtubule-associated pro-teins and plus-end-tracking proteins that are crucial for many microtubule-regulated processes . Among the latter , EB1 end binding protein-1 is a core regulator of microtubule plus-end function.25 We examined whether EM011-induced reduction in microtubule dynamicity correlated with any changes in EB1 localization in HeLa cells . In control cultures , conspicuous GFP-EB1 comets decorated the growing plus-ends of microtubules Figure 1c as expected.25 In contrast , EM011 treatment reduced the size of EB1 comets that appeared as fine puncta dispersed throughout the cell Figure 1c . This phenotype could reflect a tubulin and or microtubule conformation change that alters the binding affinity or the number of EB1-binding sites on microtubules . Alternatively , EM011 may directly inhibit EB1 binding to microtubules or EB1 stability . In either case , a drastic reduction in the amount of microtubule-bound EB1 is likely to significantly impact the behavior of microtubule plus-ends . Next , we examined how EM011 affected localization of CLIP-170 cytoplasmic linker protein-170 , another microtubule plus-end tracking protein . Inhibition of microtubule dynamics by anti-mitotic drugs can disrupt the microtubule association of CLIP-170.26 We observed that in contrast to vehicle-treated cells in which CLIP-170 localizes to microtubule plus-ends as distinct comets , EM011 treatment abolished CLIP-170�s plus-end association and caused its intracellular dispersal Figure 1c , an effect strikingly reminiscent of EM011�s effect on EB1-GFP localization . Thus , EM011 causes dramatic changes in overall microtubule dynamicity and in particular , may impair normal behavior of microtubule plus-ends , without affecting its gross morphology . EM011 induces mitotic and not G2 arrest . EM011 inhibits proliferation of various cancer cells through induction of G2 M arrest.16�20,22 To explore cell-cycle-specific events that result in mitotic-block and subsequent cell death , we chose cervical cancer HeLa cells , owing to their relatively strong checkpoints . A standard sulforhodamine-B assay reported the IC50 of EM011 in HeLa cells to be 4.5 mM data not shown . We next examined time�dose effects 10 and 25 mM EM011 on cell-cycle progression of HeLa cells flow-cytometrically Figure 2a and quantitated the proportion of cells in each cell-cycle phase Figure 2b . Our results indicated that upon drug treatment , cells transit through S-phase and accumulate in G2 M-phase with 4N DNA maximally at 24 h B72 % for 10 mM and 18 h B80 % for 25 mM EM011 Figure 2c . Furthermore , two-color flow-cytometry showed that the mitotic population peaked to B56 % 10 mM EM011 , 24 h and B63 % 25 mM EM011 , 18 h indicating time-dependent accumulation of mitotic cells at both doses Figure 2d . EM011 induces formation of multipolar spindles through centrosome amplification . We next visualized formation of highly aberrant multipolar mitotic spindles in EM011-treated cells using immunofluorescence confocal microscopy . We quantitated the frequencies of abnormal spindles using a well-accepted classification scheme , 23 at different drug-dosages over time . 25 mM EM011 induced multipolarity , predominantly with three or four poles Supplementary Movie-3 , at 12 h post-treatment Figure 3ai , top-panel . However , at 50 mM , multiple poles appeared as early as 3 h and increased in number ranging between 5 to 8 Figure 3ai , top-panel . Surprisingly , interphase cells in treated cultures displayed normal radial-arrays of microtubules at both 25 and 50 mM EM011 Figure 3ai , bottom emanating from centrosomes Supplementary Figure 1 . This is a unique edge of EM011 , compared with conventional tubulin-binding drugs that polymerize or depolymerize microtubules at concentrations higher than their IC50.24 Figure 3aii shows quantitation of frequencies of drug-induced spindle abnor-malities Types I�III . All cell-cycle stages appeared normal in control cells Figure 3b and Supplementary Movie-4 . In drug-treated cultures , mitotic cells with bipolar , as well as multipolar spindles Supplementary Figure 2a , displayed defects in chromosome congression to the mid-plate . Concomitant with the appearance of multipolar spindles , the kinase activity of Aurora B increased Supplementary Figure 2b , suggesting presence of aberrant kinetochore� microtubule attachments.27 Further evidence for the same came from the strong increase in BubR1 staining in EM011-treated cells Supplementary Figure 2c , top-row compared with controls . An increase in BubR1 phosphorylation Supplementary Figure 2d , implied a lack of tension and or existence of aberrant kinetochore�microtubule connections that caused spindle checkpoint activation . It is intriguing that 25 and 50 mM drug concentrations trigger conspicuous spindle multipolarity with a striking declustering of super-numerary centrosomes . Although suppression of microtubule dynamics may also be involved in multipolar spindle forma-tion , other mechanisms such as interference with centro-some duplication28 or dispersion of pericentriolar material to generate multiple microtubule-nucleating sites could result in multipolar spindles.29 Microtubule-targeting drugs are also known to influence centrosome structure presumably by disrupting microtubule-dependent events in centrosome biogenesis.2 Centrosome hyperamplification may also result from a prolonged S-phase30 or cytokinesis failure.31 However , our previously published data from various cell-types and data shown in Figure 2 emphasize that EM011-treated cells do not stall in S-phase . Also , the rapid emergence of multipolar phenotype rules out cytokinesis failure and consequent multinucleation as possible causes . As tightly regulated centrosome duplication is crucial to proper spindle bio-genesis , we examined whether centrosomes could be one of the targets of EM011 and whether they contributed to the formation of multipolar spindles . We performed a-and g-tubulin staining to examine the presence of a true centrosome on each spindle pole . Although majority of vehicle-treated mitotic cells showed only two spots of g-tubulin per cell , supernumerary centrosomes were present at multiple spindle poles upon EM011 treatment Figure 3ci and cii and only B15 % of EM011-treated mitotic cells showed two g-tubulin spots per cell . The frequencies of three g-tubulin spots and four or more g-tubulin spots per mitotic cell were B13-fold and B30-fold higher , respectively , in EM011-treated cells than in vehicle-treated cells Figure 3cii . Thus , EM011 exposure causes centrosome amplification and the centrosomal component g-tubulin is present at each of the multiple poles . EM011-induced supernumerary centrosomes contain �real� centrioles . The detection of g-tubulin at spindle poles alone is not sufficient to unambiguously distinguish between centrosome overduplication and centrosomal matrix fragmentation . To distinguish between centrosome fragmentation and overduplication , we evaluated centriole profiles in EM011-induced supernumerary centrosomes using anti-centrin-2 antibodies . Centrin-2 localizes to distal-lumen of centrioles and their interconnecting fibers.32 Although vehicle-treated mitotic cells contained two centrosomes , each with a pair of centrioles , EM011-treated cells had amplified centrosomes with each g-tubulin-positive structure contain-ing the centriolar component , centrin-2 Figure 4a . Majority of vehicle-treated mitotic cells contained only four centrin-2 spots per cell . However , a large proportion of EM011-treated mitotic cells had six or more centrin-2 spots per cell that co-localized with the g-tubulin-positive spindle poles Figure 4b . These data strongly suggested that multipolarity was in fact due to abnormal amplification of centrosomes that clearly contained centrioles . Interestingly , EM011 also caused untimely disengagement of centriole pairs and the intercentriolar distance was increased by B2.5 fold in drug-treated cells compared with controls Figure 4c . Occasionally , four spots of centrin-2 were visible in close proximity Figure 4d . However , alternative possibilities , viz , de novo synthesis or localization of centriolar components , 33 can not be ruled out . EM011 deregulates centrosome duplication . To further establish whether EM011 treatment caused misregulation of centrosome duplication cycle , we examined levels of Polo-like kinase 4 Plk4 , a central regulator of centriole biogenesis , the overexpression of which produces super-numerary centrioles . Conversely , RNA interference of Plk4 causes sequential reduction of centriole numbers , 34 indi-cating that intracellular Plk4 abundance must be tightly regulated to prevent untimely centriole reduplication . We found that Plk4 levels increased by 12 h post-treatment Figure 5a when supernumerary centrosomes begin to appear , and rose further between 12�24 h of EM011 exposure . Plk4 accumulation , therefore , correlated with the period of centrosome duplication in drug-treated cells and may disrupt control of centriole numbers in these cells . Cyclin E levels also surged during the same time interval Figure 5a as increase in Plk4 levels . This was noteworthy as in human cells , centriole overduplication through concurrent formation of multiple daughter centrioles at single maternal centrioles , requires cooperative action of both cyclin E cdk2 and Plk4.33 Next , we examined the levels of Aurora kinase A , the overexpression of which also leads to centrosome EM011-induced mitotic arrest is followed by an exit from mitosis . Among the possible outcomes of drug-induced mitotic arrest , one involves an erroneous exit from mitosis in the presence of drug , and subsequent transition into interphase . We thus evaluated the fate of chronically amplification and cellular transformation.35 EM011 treatment caused an increase in Aurora A levels Figure 5a and its kinase activity Figure 5b , concomitant with accumulation of Plk4 and cyclin E. Immunostaining also showed a massive increase in intracellular Aurora A levels in treated cells , compared with controls in which Aurora A was clearly restricted to centrosomes Figure 5c . Taken together , our data show that EM011-triggered induction of spindle multipolarity through centrosome amplification and declustering is accompanied by an accumulation of cyclin E , Plk4 and Aurora A kinases , factors that could be responsible for deregulation of centrosome duplication . arrested mitotic cells . Our data show that although B56 % cells were mitotically arrested at 24 h , B51 % of cells exited mitosis without cytokinesis at 36 h after treatment Figure 5d . These cells were still tetraploid 4N , but were no longer MPM-2 positive , implying that they had exited mitosis . As multinucleation and tetraploidy are the hallmarks of mitotic slippage , it is likely that several aberrant mitotic cells had slipped out of mitosis Figure 5d and e without proceeding through normal anaphase and cytokinesis . Upon exit from mitosis , these cells decondense their chromatin forming multinucleated , pseudo G1-like tetraploid cells Figure 5e , right . EM011 induces chronic mitotic delay followed by cell death by multiple fates . Next , we reduced temporal heterogeneity to closely monitor EM011-induced responses by synchronizing HeLa cells at the G1 S boundary . Upon G1 S release , we determined the average time control cells spend in each cell-cycle phase Supplementary Figure 3 and examined immunostained vehicle-and drug-treated cells for their spindle and nuclear morphologies Figure 6ai . At 8 h post release , most drug-treated cells showed numerous microtubule nucleation sites due to centrosome amplifi-cation evident as distinct bright spots Figure 6ai . These typically aberrant G2 cells then rounded up into abnormal multipolar mitotic cells at about 9�10 h and accumulated up to 20 h post release Figure 6ai . At 12 h of EM011-treatment post release , several g-tubulin spots 3 , 4 or 5 were evident Figure 6aii b�d . This was in stark contrast to vehicle-treated cells that underwent a normal anaphase at 7�8 h , cytokinesis at 8�9 h and progressed into the next interphase at about 9 h post release Figure 6aiii a�d . Next , we quantitated cells in various cell-cycle phases upon drug-treatment post release over time by dual-color flow cytometry Figure 6bi . Upon G1 S release , both vehicle-and drug-treated cells displayed comparable kinetics of progression through S and G2 phases indicating that EM011 did not affect cell-cycle progression through these phases Figure 6bi . However , at B9 h post release , drug-treated cells begin to arrest in mitosis with 4N DNA and positive MPM-2 staining , in contrast to vehicle-treated cells that had transited through mitosis and completed their cell cycle . Drug-treated cells remain stuck in mitosis with MPM-2-positive population peaking at 16 h to B85 % Figure 6bii . A sub-G1 population at 20h that continued to accumulate until 24h indicated apoptosis Figure 6biii . Cyclin B1 accumulation commenced at 6h of drug-treatment post release , and continued to increase until 20h post release Figure 6biv , and declined thereafter perhaps due to mitotic slippage . Apoptosis induction was confirmed by detection of cleaved caspase-3 and PARP expression Figure 6biv between 12�24h post release . Following mitotic arrest , EM011-treated cells display variable cellular outcomes . Consequent to mitotic arrest , cells are consigned to variable fates on the basis of two competing networks , one being cyclin B1 driven and the other being caspase-3 dictated.36 As our immunoblotting data in Figure 6biv reflect average protein levels within entire cell populations , we comprehended drug-induced outcomes at single-cell level by double immunostaining cells for microtubules and DNA . Drug-treated synchronized cells were microscopically observed after 20 h of drug-exposure post release . This time point was chosen as B80�90 % cells accumulate in mitosis at 16 h post release . In agreement with the notion of intraline variation , we observed that mitotically arrested cells displayed substantial variation in their ultimate fates . First , cell death was initiated in B10� 20 % of mitotically arrested cells Figure 7A , a�d . Figure 7A , a�d show mitotic cells with tubulin accumulation in the blebs . Second , B40 % n ? 200 cells exited mitosis without cytokinesis into a multinucleate G1-like interphase Figure 7A , e . We also found multinucleated cells succum-bing to cell death as indicated by the appearance of highly fragmented nuclei Figure 7A , f�g . We speculate that the unsilenced spindle checkpoint complex might trigger apoptosis in these pseudo-4N G1-like inter-phase cells . Occasionally , multinucleated cells initiated cell death by blebbing Figure 7A , h . Some cells showed condensed chromatin , reminiscent of apoptotic bodies Figure 7A , i�j . We also noted asymmetric cell divisions of apoptosis-reluctant cells into three or four daughter cells generating high-grade aneuploidy Figure 7A , k�l . Such divisions often led to asymmetric distribution of cytoplasm anisocytosis and DNA anisokaryosis , which perhaps explain a sub-G1 peak because cells would then have an average of 1.33N DNA instead of 2N DNA and might be inviable . These observations support the idea that high-grade aneuploidy may have a tumor-suppressive and death-promoting role.37 Some drug-treated cells underwent abnormal cytokinesis upon mitotic exit , generating multinucleated daughters con-taining varying numbers of micronuclei Figure 7A , m�n or occasionally blebs , indicating early apoptosis Figure 7A , o�p . Such abnormal cytokinesis was almost never observed in control cultures , indicating that this does not occur sponta-neously in HeLa cells . Furthermore , apoptosis induction was observed by cleaved caspase-3 and PARP immunostaining in synchronized cells that were drug treated for 20h post release Figure 7B and C . These data thus suggest that EM011-induced high-grade aneuploidy produces an intensely unstable inviable karyotype facilitating cell death . Induction of spindle multipolarity is crucial for optimal cell death . In order to understand further EM011�s mode of action , we determined its �cytotoxicity-window� by evaluating the cell-cycle phase during which treatment resulted in maximum multipolarity and cell death . We also examined whether spindle multipolarity induction was necessary for maximal cell death . To this end , we designed a phase-specific treatment regimen and exposed synchronized HeLa cells to 25 mM EM011 during the duration of each cell-cycle phase , viz , S , G2 or M-phase , followed by EM011 wash off Figure 8a . Cells were allowed to continue cell cycle for another 8 h before fixation for flow cytometry and immunostaining . The duration of each cell-cycle phase was determined on the basis of the cell-cycle progression kinetics in synchronized HeLa cells Supplementary Figure 3 . We observed that the cytotoxic effect of EM011 was maximum B30 % sub-G1 when the drug was applied between 7�11 h post release i.e. , during duration of G2 Figure 8b , c . Considerable cell death was also observed in S-phase-treated cells B15 % sub-G1 unlike cells treated in M-phase B4 % sub-G1 Figure 8c . To define more precisely the phase-specific drug sensitivity , cell-cycle phases were subdivided into early , mid and late phases , and drug treat-ment was performed as before Figure 8d . This detailed set-up revealed that the most �critical-window� for drug treatment corresponds to mid and late S and early G2 phases , but not mitosis , as cells appeared quite resistant to cell death when treated in mitosis Figure 8e . Moreover , cells treated specifically in S-phase showed multipolar mitotic spindles , whereas cells left untreated in S-phase and treated thereafter rarely showed multipolarity in mitosis Figure 8f . This correlation between enhanced spindle multipolarity and apoptosis in S G2-phase-treated cells tempts us to propose that the deregulation of centrosome duplication cycle and the resulting multipolar spindle morphology are crucial for activating apoptosis in these cells . Discussion In this study , we show that EM011 , a novel noscapinoid , induces a time-dependent robust mitotic arrest through attenuation of microtubule dynamics , and triggers loss of EB1 and CLIP-170 comets from microtubule plus-ends . As EM011 leaves interphase microtubular virtually unperturbed albeit with reduced dynamicity , it spares the vast majority of post-mitotic cells in vivo , in stark contrast to the non-specific effects of taxanes and vincas . We envision that dampening of microtubule dynamics impairs the ability of mitotic micro-tubules to capture chromosomes effectively , resulting in a large number of uncongressed chromosomes , increased Aurora B kinase activity , and spindle checkpoint activation in EM011-treated cells . Spindle checkpoint activation in turn prevents anaphase onset and cyclin B destruction , as multipolar cells accumulate in metaphase . A cell , however , can not remain arrested in metaphase indefinitely . Our data uncover a high-degree of inherent intraline variation as HeLa cells exhibit diverse fates consequent to EM011-induced mitotic arrest . Mitotic arrest concluded in several different ways perhaps depending on a complex interplay between cell cycle cyclin B1 and BubR1 and apoptosis caspase-3 and PARP regulatory molecules . Some cells showed aberrant multipolar spindles along with extensive plasma membrane blebbing indicating mitotic death . However , we can not exclude the possibility that cells that succumb to apoptosis during mitotic arrest may have suffered an insult before mitosis . Nonetheless , the appear-ance of significant sub-G1 population only after 20 h of drug exposure makes any early insult an unlikely cause in apoptosis induction in these cells . Our data instead strongly argue that prolonged metaphase arrest compels cells to seek escape routes that culminate in cell death . Mitotic slippage constitutes one such route in which cyclin B1 levels begin to decline eventually leading to an inappropriate exit from cell cycle . We found that a significant proportion of drug-treated cells slipped out of mitosis without cytokinesis , re-spread and formed massive G1-like interphase cells , often with several micronuclei . We also found an apoptosis-reluctant population that progressed through the cell cycle after mitotic stall to undergo aberrant cytokinesis generating three or four aneuploid daughter cells created by multiple cytokinetic furrows . This supports the emerging paradigm that highlights tremendous complexity in cellular responses to tubulin-binding anticancer drugs consequent to mitotic arrest . The most remarkable feature of EM011-induced mitotic arrest is hyperamplification of centrosomes and multipolar spindle formation . Although other anti-microtubule drugs , such as like taxanes and nocodazole , also generate multi-ple spindle poles at low concentrations , they primarily do so by causing pericentriolar matrix fragmentation and not by producing new centrioles . In contrast , EM011-induced spindle poles contained the hallmark components of true centrioles g-tubulin and centrin-2 . Furthermore , accumulation of cells with multipolar spindles was accompanied by a surge in Plk4 , cyclin E and Aurora A levels in drug-treated cells , suggesting deregulation of centrosome duplication , with lethal conse-quences . These findings strongly correlate with our observa-tion that EM011 exposure during S-phase was crucial for maximal apoptosis induction . Thus EM011 treatment not only reduces microtubule dynamicity but also leads to a derailment of centrosome duplication cycle , causing inappropriate centrosome amplification . Previous studies in vertebrate cells carrying extra centro-somes have shown that even though these cells initially form multipolar spindles , supernumerary centrosomes eventually aggregate at two poles resulting in bipolar division . These cells , therefore , rely on centrosome clustering for remaining viable.6�8 In contrast , EM011 causes centrosome hyperam-plification and spindle multipolarity . EM011-induced centro-some declustering is an extraordinary and unique effect of this drug that perhaps compels cells , after a prolonged mitotic arrest , to undergo multipolar and asymmetric divisions , with catastrophic consequences . Although it is presently unre-solved whether dampening of microtubule dynamics and centrosome hyperamplification represent two independent cellular activities of EM011 , or whether mechanistic links exist between the two processes , we propose that EM011-induced attenuation of microtubule dynamics directly incapacitates a cellular mechanism for suppressing multipolar mitoses , forcing the cell into a �suicidal� multipolar division . Such drugs that interfere with centrosome clustering mechanisms could potentially be selectively lethal to tumor cells that are inherently vulnerable to forming extra centrosomes or those that already possess additional centrosomes . In fact , EM011 displays remarkable tumor selectivity in various mice mod-els16�20 with no detectable toxicity to tissues with frequently proliferating normal cells . Furthermore , in contrast to the effects of EM011 on HeLa cells as reported in our study herein , the drug had no discernable effect on centrosome numbers or bipolar spindle morphology in non-malignant near-normal breast epithelial cells.38 Several studies have also demonstrated that multipolar division results in cell death from high-grade aneuploidy39 arising from intolerable amounts of chromosome missegrega-tion . Our data , therefore , focus the spotlight once again on the induction of spindle multipolarity through centrosome ampli-fication and declustering as a possible new chemotherapeutic approach . Tumors , however , comprise cellular subpopula-tions that are heterogeneous for karyotype , growth rate , metastasis , antigenicity and sensitivity to chemotherapeutics agents.40 Such clonal heterogeneity and clonal evolution during progression of human cancers present a major clinical challenge for the development of powerful and selective chemotherapeutics . Undoubtedly , further work is warranted to more fully explore the chemotherapeutic potential presented by centrosome amplification and declustering activities of tubulin-active drugs . Materials and Methods Cell lines , culture and drug treatment . HeLa cells were grown in DMEM , containing 10 % FBS . EM011 was synthesized from noscapine as previously described11 and 50 mM stock solutions were made in DMSO .

The criteria for microtubule dynamics analysis are described.19 Cell synchronization . HeLa cells were synchronized at G1 S by treatment with 2 mM thymidine for 19 h , followed by incubation in thymidine-free medium for 9 h and then incubation with 2 mM thymidine again for 16 h . Cell synchronization at G1 S boundary was confirmed by flow cytometry . Blocked cells were then released into thymidine-free medium , EM011-treated and collected at the indicated time points after G1 S release . Immunofluorescence microscopy , cell-cycle analysis , immunoprecipitation , kinase assays and immunoblotting . Cells were cultured to B70 % confluence and medium was replaced with fresh medium containing either vehicle 0.1 % DMSO or 10 mM or 25 mM EM011 for the noted times , followed by processing for immunofluorescence microcopy , flow cytometry or immunoblotting . Mitotic index was determined by using MPM-2 antibody as described.22 A detailed analysis of g-tubulin immunofluorescence signal intensity at the spindle poles was performed utilizing Metamorph analysis software to determine the proportion of cellular g-tubulin that was recruited to the spindle poles in these cells . The final output for both vehicle-and EM011-treated cells was the integrated intensity based on total stained area and staining intensity at individual pixels . To examine Aurora A and B kinase activities , Aurora A or Aurora B antibodies were used to selectively immunoprecipitate Aurora A or B proteins from control and EM011-treated HeLa cell lysates . The resulting immunoprecipitate was incubated with pure histone-H3 protein in the presence of ATP and kinase buffer . The kinase assay reaction allowed immunoprecipitated Aurora A or B to phosphorylate histone-H3 in vitro , the extent of which was measured by immunoblotting using phospho-histone-H3 antibody .

Among more than 100 types of HPVs so far identified , nearly 15 types are recognized as high-risk types that are closely linked to the development of cervical cancer , with HPV type 16 HPV16 the pre-dominant high-risk type worldwide Parkin et al. 2008 . HPV infects the basal cells of the epithelium and its genome is maintained as episomal plasmids in the nucleus such that HPV establishes latent infection . When the infected cells leave the basal layer and commence terminal differentiation of the epithelium , the viral genome starts to replicate to yield many thousands of progeny viruses . Thus , replication of the HPV genome is regulated in a strict way that depends on the differentiation status of the host epithelial cells Longworth Laimins 2004 . The replication of the HPV genome requires an origin of replication and two virally encoded proteins the DNA helicase E1 and the replication ? transcription factor E2 Kadaja et al. 2009 . To initiate viral DNA replication , E2 binds to a specific binding site at the origin and then recruits E1 , leading to the assembly of double E1 hexamers . The resultant E1 hexamer is an active replicative helicase that can induce melting of the DNA at the origin as well as subsequent unwinding of the double helical DNA during replica-tion fork progression . With the exception of continu-ous DNA unwinding by E1 , HPV uses host replication proteins , such as DNA polymerases , proliferating cell nuclear antigen and replication protein A , to accom-plish its genome replication Park et al. 1994 Melendy et al. 1995 . As two replication forks containing the E1 hexa-mers progress in opposite directions from the viral origin , bidirectional replication has been considered as a basic mode of HPV DNA replication Stenlund 2003 . Bidirectional replication was clearly demon-strated with an HPV origin-containing plasmid in a crude extract from human embryonic kidney 293 HEK293 cells Kuo et al. 1994 Kasukawa et al. 1998 , which are not natural host cells for HPVs . However , a previous study using W12 cells , which were isolated from cervical intraepithelial lesion and retain HPV16 genomes as episomes Stanley et al. 1989 , reported that replication of the HPV16 gen-ome switches from a bidirectional to a unidirectional mode on cell differentiation , which implies a rolling circle mode of HPV replication Flores Lambert 1997 . As an extract from HeLa cells was examined for its ability to support HPV replication without suc-cess Lin et al. 2000 , in vitro HPV replication has not been studied using extracts from human epithelial cells . Here , to examine how HPV replication progresses in epithelial cells , we have employed an in vitro repli-cation assay using crude extracts from differentiated epithelial cells . In addition to bidirectional replication , we have demonstrated that an extract from W12 cells induces a substantial level of rolling circle replication of an HPV16 origin-containing plasmid in a manner that depends on the presence of E1 and E2 . Possible molecular mechanisms of HPV16 rolling circle repli-cation and its physiological relevance in viral carcino-genesis are presented . Results Rolling circle replication of the HPV16 origin-containing plasmid in epithelial cell extracts To study HPV DNA replication in vitro , we con-structed a plasmid , pUC19-B-HPV16 , that harbors a DNA fragment from the HPV16 genome nucleotide positions 7003 to 880 , which includes the long con-trol region LCR , a core origin and the E6 ? E7 gene Fig. 1A . We chose this fragment because LCR con-tains the epithelium-specific enhancer for viral early transcription and the E7 region includes the differen-tiation-specific promoter for capsid expression , thus we can potentially assign epithelium-specific func-tions for these regulatory elements in HPV replica-tion Hubert et al. 1999 . The resultant plasmid also contains recognition sequences for nicking enzymes Fig. 1B , which were introduced to examine the effect of a template nick on HPV replication details are described in the next section . We prepared a crude cytoplasmic extract because it contains a signif-icant quantity of host proteins that have leaked from the nucleus during hypotonic lysis , and when pre-pared from HEK293 cells , this crude extract has been shown to support efficient cell-free HPV DNA repli - cation Kuo et al. 1994 Kasukawa et al. 1998 . In our in vitro replication assay , template plasmids were incubated in cell extracts that were supplemented with recombinant E1 and ? or E2 , after which repli-cated DNAs that had incorporated [ 32P ] -labeled nucleotides were analyzed by agarose gel electropho-resis . We first carried out replication assays using extracts from two cell lines HEK293 cells and HaCaT cells human immortalized keratinocytes that had been differentiated in high Ca2+-containing medium . In addition to circular replication products , which included replication intermediates R.I. generated by bidirectional replication , a small amount of replicated DNA remained near the well position in the gel was detected with the HaCaT extract but not with the HEK293 extract Fig. 1C . The generation of this presumed high-molecular-weight DNA was depen-dent on HPV16 DNA having the origin , and the presence of both E1 and E2 , fully meeting the mini-mal requirements for HPV DNA replication . A small amount of DNA products from pUC19-B in the HaCaT extract Fig. 1C , lanes 9�12 was sensitive to DpnI digestion data not shown , suggesting that they are repair products . We next examined the ability of an extract from another epithelial cell line , W12 cells , to support the production of the high-molecular-weight DNA in the replication reaction . The high-molecular-weight DNA was generated in the extract from differentiated W12 cells more efficiently than in the extract from HaCaT cells Fig. 1D . The amount of the high-molecular-weight DNA increased linearly with reaction time in the W12 cell extract Fig. 1E . We further conducted replication reactions with extracts from undifferentiated W12 cells , yet the undifferentiated cell extract did not support efficient HPV16 DNA replication Fig. 1F . A previous report demonstrated that similar high-molecular-weight replication products were synthe-sized in an extract from HEK293 cells that had been infected with herpes simplex virus type 1 HSV-1 Skaliter et al. 1996 , the conclusion being that lin-ear concatemeric DNAs are synthesized by HSV-1 proteins through a rolling circle mechanism . High-molecular-weight replication products by rolling circle replication were also observed in a cell-free replication assay using an extract from HeLa cells with a plasmid containing the origin of simian virus 40 SV40 and the viral large T antigen Walther et al. 1999 . Thus , we examined whether the high-molecular-weight DNA in our replication reactions is a rolling circle replication product . For this purpose , we treated replication products with restriction enzymes HindIII or NcoI , which can only cleave the template plasmid once Fig. 2A , and analyzed the digested DNA on agarose gels . The enzyme treatment completely abolished the appear-ance of the high-molecular-weight DNA in the W12 cell extract , while leading to a concomitant increase in the level of a linear DNA product form III Fig. 2B , lanes 2�4 . Moreover , a gel piece containing the high-molecular-weight DNA Fig . 2B , lane 2 , indicated with the arrowhead was excised , in which the DNA was treated with HindIII Fig. 2C . Figure 2 High-molecular-weight DNA was converted to a unit-length linear template by restriction enzyme treatment . A Positions of recognition sites for HindIII and NcoI in pUC19-B-HPV16 . B Replication assay using cytoplasmic extracts from W12 and human embryonic kidney 293 cells . pUC19-B-HPV16 was incubated in the extracts supplemented with FLAG-E1 and His-E2 as indicated . After the reaction , deproteinized DNA products were treated with HindIII lanes 3 and 7 or NcoI lanes 4 and 8 and then subjected to agarose gel electrophoresis , followed by visualization of [ 32P ] -labeled replicated DNAs . The positions of replication intermediates R.I. , forms II and III of the template plasmid II and III are indicated . The arrowhead indicates a high-molecular-weight DNA product . H , HindIII N , NcoI . C The high-molecular-weight DNA product in lane 2 of panel B was excised and in-gel treated with or without HindIII , then embedded in a 1 % agarose gel lanes 2 and 1 , followed by electrophoresis and visualization of [ 32P ] -labeled replicated DNAs . The replication products in the W12 extract were digested with HindIII as in lane 3 of panel B and run in the same gel as a position marker of form III DNA lane 3 . Subsequently , the HindIII-treated gel piece was embedded in another agarose gel , followed by the second electrophoresis . Again , the HindIII treatment converted the high-molecular-weight DNA to a unit-length linear DNA Fig . 2C , lane 2 . These results indicate that the high-molecular-weight DNA gener-ated in epithelial cell extracts is composed of tandem repeats of a unit-length pUC19-B-HPV16 DNA , which is a characteristic of replication products syn-thesized by a rolling circle mechanism . The structure of the high-molecular-weight DNA generated in the W12 cell extract was further investi-gated . The high-molecular-weight DNA was purified from a gel , followed by ligation of a short adaptor DNA . The ligated DNA was then digested with Hin-dIII and subjected to PCR using primers specific for the adaptor and HPV16 sequences . The result of this experiment revealed amplification of adaptor-ligated DNA fragments having pUC19-B-HPV16 sequences data not shown , indicating that the high-molecular-weight DNA has a terminal end . Moreover , treat-ment of the high-molecular-weight DNA with DNA gyrase , which introduces positive supercoils into cir-cular DNA , did not affect its appearance on agarose gels data not shown . Taken together , these observa-tions strongly suggest that the high-molecular-weight DNA detected in the epithelial cell extracts reflects a linear concatemeric DNA generated by rolling circle replication . Introduction of nick on template enhances HPV16 rolling circle replication in vitro We tested whether a nick on the template affects the rolling circle replication of pUC19-B-HPV16 , because template nicking is generally required for initiation of rolling circle replication in other systems , such as uX174 phage Better Freifelder 1983 , bac-terial plasmid pT181 Noirot et al. 1990 and porcine circoviruses Faurez et al. 2009 . The plasmid tem-plates were treated with nicking enzymes , Nt . BbvCI or Nb . BbvCI , which can introduce a strand-specific nick at a specific site Figs 1B and 3A . The nicked or untreated templates were then subjected to the same replication reaction described for the W12 cell extract . Introduction of the nick enhanced the rolling circle replication of pUC19-B-HPV16 approximately twofold compared to the untreated template , regard-less of nick orientation Figs 3B , C , whereas no effect was observed on bidirectional replication products form II and R.I. . In contrast , nicking did not provoke any rolling circle replication in the HEK293 Figure 3 Introduction of a nick on the template promotes rolling circle replication .

Relaxing supercoiled template enhances HPV16 rolling circle replication in vitro As a nick on a supercoiled plasmid relives superhelical torsion , we investigated whether relaxation of a su-percoiled template is sufficient to enhance the rolling circle replication in the W12 cell extract . To this end , we prepared a relaxed template by pre-treatment of pUC19-B-HPV16 with topoisomerase I Fig. 4A . Rolling circle replication in the W12 cell extract was enhanced with the relaxed template compared to the supercoiled template Fig. 4B , C , suggesting that the degree of superhelical torsion in the circular DNA affects rolling circle replication . On the other hand , the high-molecular-weight DNA product was not generated in the reaction with a linear template , indi-cating that the circular structure of the template is an essential prerequisite for rolling circle replication . Inhibition of HPV16 rolling circle replication by the addition of HEK293 extract By mixing W12 and HEK293 cell extracts in the rep-lication reaction , we sought insights into the mecha-nisms for the induction of HPV16 rolling circle replication . Increasing amounts of the HEK293 cell extract were added to the replication reaction with the W12 cell extract , and replication products from pUC19-B-HPV16 were analyzed . The rolling circle replication products synthesized in the W12 cell extract were decreased by the addition of the HEK293 cell extract , whereas the level of bidirec-tional replication products was not changed Fig. 5A , B . Heat treatment of the HEK293 extract at 95 ? C for 10 min abolished its ability to inhibit the rolling circle replication data not shown , suggesting that heat-sensitive factor s are involved in the inhibi-tion . These results imply that the extract from HEK293 cells contains inhibitory factor s for the induction of HPV16 rolling circle replication . Finally , we examined the contributions of the LCR , the core origin and the E6 ? E7 region to HPV16 rolling circle replication . Three fragments of the HPV16 gen-ome , nucleotide positions 7003 to 864 , 7838 to 100 and 281 to 864 , were cloned into pGL3-Basic to pro-duce three plasmids , pGL3-7003 ? 864 , pGL3-7838 ? 100 and pGL3-281 ? 864 , respectively Fig. 6A . These plasmids were tested as substrates for the Figure 4 Relaxation of the template plasmid enhanced rolling circle replication .

This result suggests a pivotal role of the core origin in inducing HPV16 rolling circle repli-cation . Discussion In the present study , we have demonstrated for the first time that extracts from human epithelial cells induce rolling circle replication of the HPV16 origin-containing plasmid in vitro . Rolling circle replication of the HPV16 genome was previously demonstrated in differentiated W12 cells by two-dimensional gel analyses of viral replication Flores Lambert 1997 . In agreement with this cell-based study , we find that cytoplasmic extracts from differentiated W12 cells support the rolling circle replication of the HPV16 Figure 6 HPV16 genome regions required for rolling circle replication .

However , as the extract from undif-ferentiated W12 cells failed to induce efficient HPV16 DNA replication Fig. 1F , the dependency of HPV16 rolling circle replication on epithelial dif-ferentiation has not been confirmed in our cell-free assays . As the HPV16 rolling circle replication detected in the epithelial cell extracts shows dependency on the origin , E1 and E2 , in the same way as bidirectional replication , the two replication modes are thought to share the same initiation mechanism . Hence , we pro-pose a model in which HPV16 rolling circle replica-tion diverges from bidirectional replication by failure of replication termination Fig. 7 . To start replication from the origin , the E1 hexamer encircles a single-stranded DNA at the origin and moves in a 3� to 5� direction thereby inducing an unwinding of a duplex DNA by a strand exclusion mechanism Castella et al. 2006 Enemark Joshua-Tor 2006 . In bidirectional replication , two replication forks , moving from the origin , converge near the point antipodal to the ori-gin . Replication proteins at the forks then dissociate from the DNA to allow for completion of replication . One possible mechanism for the induction of HPV16 rolling circle replication is that E1 fails to dissociate from the DNA on collision of two replication forks and displaces the 5�-end of DNA that has been syn-thesized by the other replication fork , thus allowing a single-stranded circular DNA to serve as a continuous template for rolling circle replication . The inability of the linear template to induce rolling circle replication Fig. 4 also supports this model . Furthermore , the mixing experiments using HEK293 and W12 cell extracts Fig. 5 suggest that inhibitory factor s for rolling circle replication are included in the HEK293 cell extract and that these factor s may help dissocia-tion of E1 from DNA in the final phase of HPV rep-lication . In contrast to the well-defined initiation phase , little is known about the molecular mecha-nisms for the termination of HPV replication . Thus , our in vitro system that can detect HPV16 rolling circle replication may be useful to identify host factors that are necessary for the termination of HPV replication . Compared to rolling circle replication systems employed by bacteria and other viruses , the HPV16 rolling circle replication described in this study is unique in that it is enhanced not only by a nicked circular template but also by relaxed one . Although precise mechanisms for this enhancement are not clear , using the less optimal template for replication may increase the probability of termination failure thereby leading to an increase in rolling circle replica-tion . Negative supercoils in a circular DNA topologi-cally favor unwinding of a right-handed DNA duplex and permit efficient progression of replication forks , because negative supercoils neutralize positive super-coils generated by unwinding of a DNA duplex ahead of a replication fork Postow et al. 2001 . One can therefore assume that a relaxed or nicked circular DNA without negative superhelical contortion is a less optimal substrate for DNA replication compared to a negatively supercoiled template . In this regard , it is worth noting that circular genomes of SV40 and polyoma virus are isolated as a negatively supercoiled DNA from infected cells Vinograd et al. 1965 Keller 1975 Fanning Zhao 2009 . Because most episomal HPV16 genomes in W12 cells are similarly recovered as a supercoiled DNA Jeon Lambert 1995 Flores et al. 1999 , HPV genomes are predicted to be nega-tively supercoiled in cells and might thus be resistant to rolling circle replication . Rolling circle replication is widely employed by herpes viruses , such as HSV-1 Jacob et al. 1979 Boehmer Lehman 1997 and Epstein�Barr virus Hammerschmidt Sugden 1988 . They have linear DNA genomes of more than 100 kbp , and the linear genome becomes circularized in infected cells to establish latent infection , where the circular genome replicates in a bidirectional mode . In contrast , during the lytic phase of the viral life cycle the replication mode switches to a rolling circle mode , leading to the production of a linear , concatemeric viral gen-ome . Importantly , the genome of these herpes viruses encodes the viral terminase complex that can cleave the concatemeric genome at a specific site to generate unit-length viral genomes for progeny viruses Homa Brown 1997 . Given that no such virally encoded proteins for cleavage of viral genomes have been identified in HPVs , it seems likely that HPV rolling circle replication is an accidental abortive replication that disrupts the HPV life cycle . Finally , high-risk HPV DNA is frequently inte-grated into the chromosome of cervical cancer cells and is occasionally found amplified as head-to-tail tandem repeats Jeon et al. 1995 Pett Coleman 2007 Lace et al. 2009 , as typically observed in CaSki cells , which harbor approximately 500 tandem repeats of the HPV16 genome Callahan et al. 1992 Van Tine et al. 2004 . Although the underlying mechanism behind this type of viral DNA integra-tion is elusive , a plausible explanation is that a linear concatemeric HPV genome is synthesized in cells by a rolling circle mechanism , followed by integration into the host chromosome through cellular pathways for double-strand break repair . Given that nicks in DNA are frequently produced in cells by endoge-nous reactive oxygen species , nicks arising on the HPV genome may contribute to accidental induc-tion of rolling circle replication of the HPV genome in a cellular environment . Although this hypothesis awaits further experimental investigation , HPV roll-ing circle replication may have physiological implica-tions for HPV DNA integration into the host chromosome and subsequent progression into cervi-cal cancers . Experimental procedures Cell culture W12 cells clone 20850 , W12-E cells were maintained at sub-confluence on mitomycin c-treated J2 3T3 feeder cells in F medium 0.66 mM Ca2+ composed of three parts F-12 med-ium and one part Dulbecco�s modified Eagle�s medium DMEM supplemented with 5 % fetal bovine serum FBS , insulin 5 lg ? mL , cholera toxin 8.4 ng ? mL , adenine 24 lg ? mL , epidermal growth factor 10 ng ? mL and hydro-cortisone 0.4 lg ? mL in 5 % CO2 at 37 ? C. HaCaT and HEK293 cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10 % FBS in 5 % CO2 at 37 ? C . To induce differentiation , W12 cells were grown to confluence on J2 3T3 feeder cells in F medium containing 0.66 mM Ca2+ , then the medium was changed to F medium containing 1.2 mM Ca2+ and 10 % FBS , followed by further culture for 6 days . HaCaT cells were cul-tured in DMEM containing 1.8 mM Ca2+ and 10 % FBS for 6 days . To confirm the differentiation status of cells , expression of cytokeratin 10 or involucrin was examined by Western blotting . Preparation of cell extracts W12 , HaCaT and HEK293 cells were scraped in phosphate-buffered saline and washed in ice-cold hypotonic buffer [ 20 mM HEPES-KOH pH 7.6 , 5 mM KCl , 1.5 mM MgCl2 , 1 mM DTT and a protease inhibitor cocktail Roche Bio-chemicals ] . The cells were resuspended in an equal volume of hypotonic buffer , incubated on ice for 10 min and homoge-nized by a Dounce homogenizer with pestle B. The lysate was incubated on ice for 30 min , followed by centrifugation at 10 000 g for 10 min . The clarified lysate was used as crude cytoplasmic extracts . The precipitated nuclei were resuspended in an equal volume of hypotonic buffer that had been supple-mented with 200 mM NaCl , and incubated on ice for 30 min , followed by centrifugation at 10 000 g for 10 min . The resul-tant supernatant was used as nuclear extracts in Fig. 1F . Construction of DNA templates The modified pUC19 , pUC19-B , was constructed by the inser-tion of a DNA fragment , 5�-GTA CCT CAG CAT G-3� , which contains the recognition sequence for BbvCI , between SacI and XbaI sites in pUC19 . The template plasmid , pUC19-B-HPV16 , was constructed by insertion of the PstI fragment of the HPV16 genome nucleotide positions 7003 to 880 into the PstI site in pUC19-B . To be used as replication templates , negatively supercoiled pUC19-B-HPV16 and pUC19-B were purified by CsCl-gradient ultracentrifugation . To generate a nicked template , the plasmids were treated with nicking enzymes , Nb.BbvCI or Nt.BbvCI New England Biolabs . To obtain a linear template , pUC19-B-HPV16 was cleaved with HindIII , and to obtain a relaxed template , pUC19-B-HPV16 was treated with topoisomerase I Invitrogen . After the reaction , these enzymes were heat-inactivated . The plas-mids containing the HPV16 DNA fragments , pGL3-7003 ? 864 previously designated as pGL3-P670 , pGL3-7838 ? 100 and pGL3-281 ? 864 were described previously Kukimoto et al. 2008 . Preparation of recombinant E1 and E2 proteins N-terminally FLAG-tagged E1 FLAG-E1 was purified from Sf9 cells that had been infected with a recombinant baculovi-rus expressing FLAG-E1 . To construct the baculovirus transfer plasmid for the expression of FLAG-E1 , the full-length cDNA of HPV16 E1 was amplified by PCR with the template pCMV-E116 Del Vecchio et al. 1992 using primers , 5�-TCC GCG GCC GCT GAT CCT GCT GGC ACC AAT GGG GAA GAG GGT ACG-3� and 5�-CGT GAG CTC TCA TAA TGT GTT AGT ATT TTG TCC TGA-3� EagI and KpnI sites are underlined and cloned between EagI and KpnI sites of the baculovirus transfer plasmid pAcSG2 BD Bio-sciences . The cDNA sequence of a single FLAG-tag was then introduced into the N-terminus of the E1 cDNA . The recom-binant baculovirus expressing FLAG-E1 was obtained with the transfer plasmid and the BaculoGold kit BD Biosciences . Sf9 cells that had been infected with the FLAG-E1-expressing baculovirus were suspended in lysis buffer consisting of 20 mM Tris�HCl pH 8.0 , 500 mM NaCl , 4 mM MgCl2 , 0.4 mM EDTA , 2 mM DTT and 20 % glycerol , supplemented with a protease inhibitor cocktail Roche Applied Science and then disrupted with a Dounce homogenizer . After removal of insol-uble material by centrifugation , the clear supernatant was mixed with anti-FLAG M2-conjugated agarose Sigma , St. Louis , MO , USA for 4 h at 4 ? C . The resin was washed four times with wash buffer consisting of 20 mM Tris�HCl pH 8.0 , 150 mM NaCl , 2 mM MgCl2 , 1 mM DTT , 0.2 mM EDTA , 15 % glycerol , 0.01 % NP-40 and a protease inhibitor cocktail . FLAG-E1 was then eluted with wash buffer contain-ing 0.2 mg ? mL FLAG peptide Sigma . Protein concentration was estimated by SDS-PAGE and staining with GelCode Pierce . N-terminally His6-tagged E2 His-E2 was purified from E. coli BL21 DE3 pLysS that had been transformed with an expression plasmid for His-E2 . To construct the expression plasmid for His-E2 , the full-length cDNA of HPV16 E2 was amplified by PCR with the template pCMV-E216 Del Vec-chio et al. 1992 using primers , 5�-GAC GAC GAC AAG ATG GAG ACT CTT TGC CAA CGT T-3� and 5�-GAG GAG AAG CCC GGT CAT ATA GAC ATA AAT CCA GTA-3� and cloned into pET-30 Novagen , Madison , WI , USA using the Ek ? LIC cloning kit Novagen . Bacterial cells that had been transformed with the expression plasmid were lysed in BugBuster HT Protein Extraction Reagent Takara Bio Inc. supplemented with a protease inhibitor cocktail and then incubated for 20 min at room temperature . The lysate was centrifuged at 20 000 g for 20 min at 4 ? C . Four vol-umes of buffer A [ 20 mM sodium phosphate pH 7.4 and 500 mM NaCl ] containing 20 mM imidazole was added to the supernatant and passed through a 0.44-lm filter . The filtered supernatant was loaded onto a 5 mL HiTrap HP column GE Healthcare , and bound proteins were eluted on a linear gradi-ent of imidazole from 20 to 500 mM in buffer A. The fractions containing His-E2 were dialyzed against buffer B [ 20 mM sodium phosphate pH 7.4 , 300 mM NaCl , and 10 % glycerol ] . Protein concentration was determined by the Bradford assay Bio-Rad . The purified FLAG-E1 and His-E2 were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at 80 ? C until use . Cell-free replication assay An in vitro HPV16 replication assay was carried out based on the cell-free HPV11 replication assay established by Kuo et al. 1994 . Briefly , cell extracts 25 lg of W12 or HaCaT extract , or 50 lg of HEK293 extract were pre-incubated in a 25 lL of replication buffer [ 30 mM HEPES-KOH pH 7.6 , 0.5 mM DTT , 200 lM each UTP , GTP , CTP and 4 mM ATP , 100 lM each dATP , dGTP , dTTP and 25 lM dCTP , 40 mM phospho-creatine and 10 lg ? mL creatine phosphokinase ] at 37 ?

The replication reaction was initiated by adding 100 ng of FLAG-E1 , 1 ng of His-E2 , 40 ng of a plasmid template and 37 Bq of [ a-32P ] dCTP 111 TBq ? mmol to the reaction mixture , then the mixture was incubated at 37 ?

21059157	University , 86 Nishi-cho , Yonago , Tottori 683-8503 , Japan Introduction The yeast silent formation regulator protein-2 sir2 is a NAD+-dependent protein deacetylase the mamma-lian homologue of sir2 is the sirtuin family containing seven members , SIRT1�SIRT7 . These sirtuins are involved in gene silencing , cell cycle control , apopto-sis and even energy homeostasis Haigis Guarente 2006 Inoue et al. 2007a Milne Denu 2008 . Among them , SIRT1 is the most well characterized and it has been shown that SIRT1 deacetylases p53 to promote cell survival and also binds to other pro-teins such as Ku70 , NF-jB and FOXO in response Communicated by Masayuki Yamamoto Tohoku University *Correspondence toshiaki.inoue.nishida @ gmail.com to DNA damage and oxidative stress Luo et al. 2001 Brunet et al. 2004 Cohen et al. 2004 Yeung et al . 2004 . In contrast to SIRT1 , little is known about SIRT2 function . SIRT2 has the ability to shuttle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm Inoue et al. 2007b , and it deacetylases Lys-40 of tubulin and Lys-16 of histone H4 Vaquero et al. 2006 . Cell culture studies show that SIRT2 is important in cell cycle regulation . For example , SIRT2 protein levels increase during the mitotic phase and its over-expres-sion delays mitosis Dryden et al. 2003 . Our recent study showed a novel function of SIRT2 in mitotic regulation . Specifically , SIRT2 is required for efficient mitotic cell death caused by the spindle checkpoint induced by microtubule inhibitors Inoue et al. 2009 . In our previous study mentioned earlier , we observed that SIRT2 down-regulation confers resis-tance to mitotic cell death from the spindle check-point in the presence of microtubule inhibitors in HCT116 cells , a mitotic checkpoint-proficient cancer cell line used for studying checkpoints . However , in some cancer cell lines , we observed that siRNA-med-iated SIRT2 knockdown causes massive cell death even in the absence of microtubule inhibitors . This raises the possibility that SIRT2 inhibition may be a target for the killing of cancer . Consistent with this idea , several lines of evidence suggest that inhibitors of sirtuins could be used as anticancer drugs Heltweg et al. 2006 Lara et al. 2009 Watson et al. 2009 . These effects are ascribed mainly to the inhibition of SIRT1 activity , although the drugs have the potential to inhibit multiple members of the sirtuin family . We sought to provide evidence for the molecular mecha-nism through which SIRT2 inhibition is involved in tumor cytotoxicity in the present study . Here , we describe that SIRT2 down-regulation induces apop-tosis caused by p53 accumulation , which is mediated by p38 MAPK activation-dependent degradation of p300 . Results SIRT2 down-regulation leads to cell apoptosis but not cell cycle arrest To examine whether SIRT2 is involved in tumor cell growth and survival , several human cell lines were transfected with siRNA of SIRT2 or negative control siRNA , including HeLa , 293T , human immortalized mesenchymal stem cells [ hiMSC , Okamoto et al . 2002 ] , HT1080 , C33A , RCC23 , CC1 , G361 , SK - MEL-28 , DLD-1 and TIG-1 human normal fibro-blast cell lines . Cell growth and survival were then analyzed by colony formation assay or cell number count . SIRT2 protein level was depleted by more than 70 % in SIRT2 siRNA-transfected HeLa , hiMSC and TIG-1 cells as judged by immunoblotting Fig. 1 . Transfection of siRNA to SIRT2 resulted in significantly decreased cell numbers in HeLa , hiMSC , HT1080 , 293T and CC1cell lines , but not in other cells including TIG-1 cells , compared with transfec-tion of negative control siRNA Fig. 1 . The most prominent case was HeLa cells , in which the number of colonies of SIRT2 siRNA-transfected cells was 20 % of that of the control Fig. 1 . Similar results were obtained using plurality of different siRNAs to SIRT2 , with successful down-regulation of SIRT2 Fig. S1 in Supporting Information . Thus , we used HeLa cells for further study to delineate the mecha-nism by which SIRT2 down-regulation leads to the suppression of colony formation . Growth curves of HeLa cells transfected with siRNAs showed that the difference in cell number between cells transfected with SIRT2 siRNA and those with the negative control siRNA occurred in excess of 48 h after siRNA transfection Fig. 2A . It has been shown that over-expression of SIRT2 causes a lengthening of the period of mitosis in Saos2 cells Dryden et al. 2003 and a shortening of that of G1 in U937 cells Bae et al. 2004 and that loss of SIRT2 results in a clear increase in the size of the in G1-phase population and a decrease in that of the S-phase population in mouse embryonic fibroblasts Vaquero et al. 2006 . Thus , we addressed whether cells with SIRT2 down-regulation were arrested in a specific cell cycle phase . Flow cytometry analysis using cells 3 days after siRNA transfection showed no remark-able difference in cell cycle profile between cells with SIRT2 down-regulation and the control cells Fig. 2B . However , we observed accumulation of cells in sub-G1 phase with SIRT2 down-regulation in both HeLa cells and hiMSC cells after 48 h of siRNA transfection , suggesting that SIRT2 down-regulation causes apoptosis but not cell cycle arrest . To confirm this hypothesis , we performed flow cytometric detection of phosphatidylserine expression on early apoptotic cells using fluorescein-labeled Ann-exin V. Figure 2C shows that cells with SIRT2 down-regulation progressively underwent apoptosis after 24 h after siRNA transfection . We also observed induction of caspase-3 cleavage in cells with SIRT2 down-regulation Fig. 2D . These results suggest that SIRT2 down-regulation leads to apoptotic cell death in HeLa and hiMSC cells , although we also noticed that SIRT2 down-regulation did not affect some can-cer cell lines despite successful SIRT2 knockdown in these cells data not shown . p53 accumulation mediates apoptosis in cells with SIRT2 down-regulation Next , we sought to delineate the mechanism by which SIRT2 down-regulation induces apoptosis in HeLa . For this task , we examined whether p53 , which is inactivated by human papillomavirus E6 on-coprotein in HeLa cells Scheffner et al. 1990 , is involved in the apoptosis observed in HeLa cells with SIRT2 down-regulation . Immunoblotting analysis showed that p53 accumulated after 24 h of transfec - HeLa TIG-1 0 A Colorimetric B HeLa siRNA Negative Transfection control Analysis with Annexin V and PI staining D control control control treatment irradiation siRNA Negative Negative Negative Transfection SIRT2 SIRT2 SIRT2 No UV Caspase-3 -15 kDa ? -tubulin IB p21 ? -tubulin C 1.0 0.8 0.2 First , we examined whether the response to DNA damage leading to p53 stabilization is induced by a system analogous to the exhibition of impaired DNA damage response in SIRT1-mutant cells that was pre-viously reported Wang et al. 2008 . We observed no difference in the levels of c-H2AX , a marker of response to DNA damage , and p53 phosphorylation of Ser-15 and Ser-20 Rogakou et al. 1998 Shiloh 2003 between cells with SIRT2 down-regulation and control cells Fig. S2 in Supporting Information . As a second possibility , we thought that SIRT2 down-regulation increases the level of p53 acetyla-tion , based on an analogy that SIRT1 deacetylases p53 , leading to p53 stabilization . Although SIRT2 can deacetylate chemically acetylated p53 peptide in vi-tro , it does not deacetylate p53 protein in vivo Nahhas et al. 2007 . To determine whether the HeLa cell system is the same case , immunoblotting analysis of acetylated p53 was performed . The level of acetylated p53 was slightly higher in cells with SIRT2 down - B Colony number Input 400 cells 148.0 � 18.4 17.0 � 5.3 85.3 � 22.0 73.3 � 18.9 regulation than in the control at any time point examined 0�72 h Fig. S3 in Supporting Informa-tion . However , considering the increase of total p53 Fig. 3A and Fig. S3 in Supporting Information , it was suggested that the acetylation of p53 is not induced in cells with SIRT2 down-regulation . Thus , these two possibilities based on analogies with SIRT1 functions seemed unlikely . As a third possibility , we focused on p300 , which acts as a dual regulator of p53 via acetylase and poly-ubiquitin ligase E4 activities Grossman et al. 2003 . We observed that the level of p300 is significantly down-regulated in cells with SIRT2 down-regulation after 24 h of siRNA transfection Fig. 4A . Similar results were obtained using plurality of different siRNAs to SIRT2 Fig. S1 in Supporting Informa-tion . Treatment with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 restored the level of p300 in cells with SIRT2 down-regulation Fig. 4A , suggesting that decrease of p300 is because of proteasome-mediated degradation as previously reported Poizat et al. 2000 . We simultaneously examined the level of p38 MAPK activation that can induce the phosphoryla-tion-mediated degradation of p300 Grossman et al. 2003 by immunoblotting of phospho p38 MAPK activated form of p38 MAPK . Consistent with the fact that the level of p300 is decreased in cells with SIRT2 down-regulation , p38 MAPK was activated in cells with SIRT2 down-regulation after 24 h of siRNA transfection Fig. 4A . We observed that the level of MDM2 , a negative regulator of p53 , was decreased in cells with SIRT2 down-regulation , reflecting the decreased levels of p300 , the activity of which is required to stabilize MDM2 Zeng et al. 2003 Fig. 4A . These results suggest that SIRT2 down-regulation caused p38 MAPK activation lead-ing to p53 accumulation via decreases in p300 and MDM2 , eventually inducing apoptosis in HeLa cells . To confirm that p300 down-regulation by p38 MAPK is required for apoptosis in cells with SIRT2 down-regulation , we treated cells with SIRT2 down-regulation followed by p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580 treatment and then performed colony for-mation assay and cell number count . We observed that treatment of p38 MAPK inhibitor unexpectedly sup-pressed colony formation and thus could not examine whether p38 MAPK activation is involved in apoptosis in cells with SIRT2 down-regulation Fig. S4 in Sup-porting Information . It was thought that suppression of colony formation by p38 MAPK inhibitor was because of apoptosis induced by long-term exposure to p38 MAPK inhibitor as previously reported Nemoto et al. 1998 Kankaanranta et al. 1999 . We then used siRNA to p38 MAPK to down-regulate p38 MAPK expres-sion however , we observed a similar phenomenon Fig. S4 in Supporting Information . Thus , we could not directly show that p38 MAPK activation mediates apoptosis in cells with SIRT2 down-regulation . However , intriguingly , we observed that the increase in phospho p300 level in cells with SIRT2 down-regulation is suppressed by the treatment of p38 MAPK inhibitor Fig. 4B . It is also observed that the increase in p53 level in cells with SIRT2 down-regulation is suppressed by the treatment of p38 MAPK inhibitor Fig. 4C . Furthermore , the lev-els of p300 and MDM2 in cells with SIRT2 down-regulation were restored by p38 MAPK inhibitor treatment after 48 h of siRNA transfection , whereas the level of p53 was decreased in these cells Fig. 4C . These results support the notion that p53 accumula-tion by SIRT2 down-regulation is caused by p38 MAPK-mediated p300 degradation . We also performed siRNA-mediated down-regula-tion of SIRT2 , p300 or both , followed by colony formation assay and apoptosis detection . We observed that p300 down-regulation causes a significant decrease in colony formation and induces apoptosis , as well as SIRT2 down-regulation Fig. 4D . Further-more , the level of p53 is up-regulated by p300 down-regulation alone like by SIRT2 down-regula-tion Fig. 4E . We observed at the same time that the suppression of colony formation and p53 accumula-tion in cells with p300 down-regulation alone is lower than cells with SIRT2 down-regulation alone . Taken together , these results suggest that p38 MAPK-dependent p300 down-regulation at least par-tially mediates apoptosis via p53 accumulation in cells with SIRT2 down-regulation . Furthermore , it was observed p38 MAPK activation and p300 down-reg-ulation after 8 h of siRNA transfection in cells with SIRT2 down-regulation preceding p53 accumulation Fig. 4F . It was thought , therefore , that p38 MAPK-dependent p300 down-regulation is an early event required for p53 accumulation in cells with SIRT2 down-regulation , although we can not rule out the possibility that other mechanisms contributes to p53 accumulation and apoptosis induction . In addition to p300 , p38 MAPK has been reported to directly phosphorylate Ser-33 and Ser-46 of p53 , leading to apoptosis induction Bulavin et al. 1999 . Thus , we examined the possibility that this pathway contributes to the accumulation of p53 in cells with SIRT2 down-regulation , as well as to the pathway in which p300 down-regulation by p38 MAPK induces p53 accumulation . We observed an increase in p53 phosphorylation of Ser-33 in cells with SIRT2 down-regulation Fig. S2 in Supporting Information . However , because the level of total p53 was increased to a higher extent at each time point Fig. 3A and Fig. S2 in Supporting Informa-tion , the possibility that p53 phosphorylation of Ser-33 by p38 MAPK contributes to apoptosis induction unlikely . Discussion The present study suggests that SIRT2 down-regula-tion causes p38 MAPK activation , followed by down-regulation of p300 and MDM2 , both of which lead to p53 accumulation , which eventually induces apoptosis in HeLa cells Fig. 5 . Activation of this pathway was observed in the early phase after SIRT2 down-regulation Fig. 4F . We can not rule out other mechanisms of action by which SIRT2 down-regula - p300 IB irradiation 48 h 72 h -260 kDa -70 kDa -55 kDa C SB203580 ? ? + + Treatment IB tion causes cell death . For example , p300 knockdown induced p53 accumulation and cell death to a lower extent than SIRT2 knockdown Fig. 4D , E . There-fore , we conclude that SIRT2 down-regulation control control control Negative Negative Negative siRNA SIRT2 SIRT2 SIRT2 Transfection ? -tubulin induces apoptosis at least partially via p38 MAPK activation , followed by p300 down-regulation and MDM2 , leading to p53 accumulation in HeLa cells . The insights obtained by the present study may p53 acetylation account for the previous observation by Matsushita et al. that the transcriptional activity of p53 determined by reporter assay is up-regulated in SIRT2-deficient chicken B-cell-derived DT40 cells Matsushita et al. 2005 . Inhibitors of sirtuins have been reported as potent anticancer drugs . These effects are ascribed mainly to the inhibition of SIRT1 activity , and it was observed that siRNA-mediated SIRT1 down-regulation caused a significant decrease in colony formation by HeLa cells Fig. S5 in Supporting Information . However , the present study raises the possibility that SIRT2 can be a target molecule for cancer therapy as well as SIRT1 and indicates the molecular basis involved . The mammalian SIRT family proteins SIRT1-7 require NAD+ that is widely used in the metabolic reactions , as a cofactor for activity Inoue et al. 2007a . This immediately suggests that SIRT family proteins may serve as sensors of the metabolic state and cellular energy state . The link between SIRT1 and metabolism has been well studied . For example , it is known that SIRT1 is required for calorie restric-tion response Chen et al. 2008 Donmez Guarente 2010 . The findings obtained in the present study suggest that SIRT2 , as well as SIRT1 , may function as a cellular energy-sensing checkpoint that controls cell growth through p53 regulation , with different mechanisms of action . We have not addressed the reason why SIRT2 down-regulation leads to growth suppression in some cancer cells , whereas other cancer cell lines are toler-ant to it . Sensitive cancer cell lines HeLa , hiMSC , RCC23 , HT1080 , 293T harbor wild-type p53 , with the exception of RCC23 , whereas tolerant cancer cell lines SK-MEL-28 , G361 , CC1 , C33A , DLD-1 har-bor mutant p53 or null p53 , with the exception of G361 . Thus , one possible explanation is that the sta-tus of p53 may determine sensitivity to SIRT2 down-regulation . It has been reported that SIRT2 knockout mice appear to be normal Vaquero et al. 2006 . We also observed that human normal fibro-blasts are tolerant to SIRT2 down-regulation Fig. 1 . Although we do not know why normal cells are tol-erant to SIRT2 down-regulation , these insights illus-trate the potential of SIRT2 as a cancer therapeutic target particularly for cancer harboring wild-type p53 . Regarding the relationship between SIRT2 and p300 , it has been reported that SIRT2 deacetylates p300 to promote the binding of p300 to the preiniti-ation complex on chromatin Black et al. 2008 and also that p300 acetylates SIRT2 to decrease its deacet-ylation activity Han et al. 2008 . However , the pres-ent study suggests that SIRT2 can stabilize p300 via p38 MAPK inactivation . Taken together , these stud-ies show the existence of a complex regulatory loop between SIRT2 and p300 . The biologic significance of this regulatory loop remains to be clarified . On the basis of the scenario indicated by the pres-ent study , p38 MAPK activation appears to be is the initial event caused by SIRT2 down-regulation . The mammalian p38 MAPK family members are activated by cellular stress including UV irradiation , DNA damage , heat shock , high osmotic stress , oxidative stress , proinflammatory cytokines , such as IL-1 and TNF-a , and certain mitogens Mittelstadt et al. 2005 . Among them , DNA damage is unlikely to activate p38 MAPK in cells with SIRT2 down-regulation as we observed no difference in the levels of c-H2AX between cells with SIRT2 down-regulation and the control cells Fig. S2 in Supporting Information . Loss of centrosome integrity also induces p38 MAPK acti-vation Mikule et al. 2007 , and we have also reported the involvement of SIRT2 function in cen-trosome integrity in HCT116 cells in which the mitotic checkpoint is activated Inoue et al. 2009 . Thus , we performed immunostaining of the centro-some in cells with SIRT2 down-regulation . How-ever , we observed no structural or numerical alteration of the centrosome in these cells data not shown . It remains to be determined which type of stimuli or pathway induces p38 MAPK activation in cells with SIRT2 down-regulation . In addition , the target protein of SIRT2 for deacetylation to illustrate p38 MAPK activation remains to be identified . We think that the clarification of downstream molecules of SIRT2 is crucial to show the mechanism of how SIRT2 down-regulation causes p38 MAPK activa-tion . We are currently conducting a proteomics-based study to identify the substrates for deacetylation by SIRT2 . Further study to shed light on these issues will be useful to identify the mechanism that creates differences in the response to SIRT2 down-regulation among cancer cells and to increase the efficacy of SIRT2 as a target for cancer therapy . Experimental procedures Cell culture and siRNA transfection All cell lines were cultured in the appropriate medium con-taining 10 % fetal bovine serum Biowest . The siRNAs corre-sponding to SIRT2 and p300 and the negative control siRNA were obtained from Qiagen . The siRNA corresponding to p38 MAPK was obtained from Cell Signaling Technology .

21070511	Introduction Pold is involved in lagging strand DNA replication and excision repair pathways Blank et al. 1994 Burg-ers 1998 Kunkel Burgers 2008 Nick McElhinny et al. 2008 . Pold consists of four subunits � p125 , p50 , p66 and p12 Podust et al. 2002 . The catalytic p125 subunit and the p50 subunit are highly conserved among eukaryotic species and are essential for cell proliferation . In addition to the polymerase domain , the p125 subunit contains a 3��5� exonucle-ase domain , which is responsible for its proofreading activity . In association with PCNA , Pold is highly processive and synthesizes DNA with remarkable accuracy , catalyzing approximately one error per 106 nucleotides polymerized in vivo . This exceptional Communicated by Hiroyuki Araki *Correspondence khirota @ rg.med.kyoto-u.ac.jp does not conform to canonical Watson�Crick geome-try . Therefore , it is believed that Pold is incapable of bypassing damaged templates . UV light induces two major UV photoproducts on genomic DNA , CPD and 6-4 PP . These UV lesions stall replicative DNA polymerases in vivo and signifi-cantly delay the elongation of newly synthesized DNA Prakash 1981 Edmunds et al. 2008 Guo et al. 2008 Niimi et al. 2008 . Compared with CPD , 6-4 PP introduces stronger structural distortions into the DNA backbone , leading to a much tougher block to replication Kim Choi 1995 . To release such repli-cation blockage , cells mobilize specialized DNA polymerases , translesion synthesis TLS polymerases , which insert nucleotides opposite UV photoproducts and further extend DNA synthesis Friedberg et al. 2005 Lehmann et al. 2007 Guo et al. 2009 . The current model for TLS is that stalled replicative polymerases at the damaged template strands are replaced by specialized TLS polymerases , including Polf and Polg . Consistent with stronger DNA distor-tion introduced by 6-4 PP than by CPD , no single eukaryotic polymerase is able to bypass 6-4 PP , whereas Polg alone performs bypass synthesis across CPD McCulloch et al. 2004 Friedberg et al. 2005 . The capability of TLS polymerases to bypass DNA damage is attributable to their three-dimensional structures , which differs from that of replicative polymerases . The active site of TLS polymerases is larger and is thus able to accommodate DNA lesions and incorrect base pairings Ling et al. 2001 Silvian et al. 2001 Trincao et al. 2001 Yang 2005 Wang Yang 2009 . As a consequence , TLS polymerases undergo DNA synthesis with limited accuracy , and flexibly insert nucleotides opposite damaged bases , and can also extend DNA synthesis from a primer with a mismatch at its 3� end Lehmann et al. 2007 Guo et al. 2009 Waters et al. 2009 . Nonetheless , it should be noted that this extension step is a challenge for all DNA polymerases , because the polymerase activity is inhibited by the abnormal structure of the primer ? template duplex , caused by a mismatch . Con-sistent with this , in the bypass of T-T UV damage , TLS polymerases incorporate the first base opposite the 3� T of a thymidine dimer more efficiently than the second base opposite the 5� T , because the second incorporation is an extension from the primer�s 3� end , which does not properly hybridize with the 3� T of UV damage Meng et al. 2009 . In a separate study to analyze the function of the Pold p66 component , we generated pold p66 ? cells from the chicken DT40 B-cell line . Remarkably , pold p66 ? cells can proliferate and undergo replica-tion with a normal rate manuscript in preparation . Interestingly , however , pold p66 ? cells exhibited hypersensitivity to a wide variety of DNA-damaging agents , including UV . This hypersensitivity is attribut-able to impaired TLS across UV photoproducts , raising the possibility that Pold might be able to undergo TLS . To test this hypothesis , in this study , we analyzed the capability of purified human Pold to bypass CPD-and 6-4 PP-containing oligonucleotide templates . Surprisingly , even wild-type Pold [ Pold wt ] possessing the exonuclease activity was able to bypass 6-4 PP . As this nuclease activity eliminates the nucleotides incorporated opposite damaged templates , we may have underestimated the efficiency of insert-ing nucleotides opposite UV lesions by Pold . To accurately measure this efficiency , we purified Pold exo-that carries a point mutation in conserved exonuclease domain . We here characterize this novel and unique enzymatic property of Pold in bypassing 6-4 PP as well as CPD . We analyzed the capability of Pold to undergo DNA synthesis across CPD and 6-4 PP . To this end , we simultaneously expressed the four human Pold sub-units p125 , p66 , p50 and p12 in insect cells and purified Pold holoenzyme [ Pold wt ] to near homo-geneity Fig. 1 , Fig. S1 in Supporting Information . We used this enzyme for in vitro primer extension assays using a 30mer oligonucleotide template contain-ing a single CPD or 6-4 PP Fig. 1 . We used Polg as a positive control , because previous studies have shown that Polg readily bypasses CPD with high efficiency Masutani et al. 1999a , b , 2000 McCulloch et al. 2004 , whereas it incorporates only one or two bases opposite 6-4 PP without appreciable extension Yamamoto et al. 2008 . This experiment was carried out in the presence of 100 lM dNTPs as previously reported , which is ten times higher than the physio-logical concentration of dNTPs in vivo Traut 1994 . We confirmed that Polg indeed bypassed CPD efficiently , whereas it incorporated only one base opposite the 6-4 PP lesion with very poor extension McCulloch et al. 2004 Fig. 2 . We also examined the capability of Pold to bypass DNA lesions with 100 lM dNTPs , as it has been shown that Pold can bypass abasic sites under this con - A kDa Marker WT Exo - dition Fazlieva et al. 2009 Meng et al. 2009 . As pre-viously reported , the purified Pold did bypass the abasic site Fig . S1 in Supporting Information , verifying the 8 functionality of our recombinant proteins . Next , we used a CPD lesion-containing template and observed the generation of fully elongated products 30mer products as well as 31mer products , representing a 1-bp extension as well as the intermediate products of TLS , where only one or two bases were inserted opposite the CPD . The amount of fully elongated products was approximately 0.7 % of the primer used Fig . S2 in Sup-porting Information . This result was again consistent with previous reports that showed that 1 % of CPD lesions were bypassed efficiently by Pold . We tested the 6-4 PP lesion-carrying template , which is heavily distorted and therefore thought to be considerably more difficult to bypass than abasic sites or CPD lesions . To our surprise , Pold wt also incor-porated one or two bases opposite 6-4 PP Fig. 2 and was even able to generate fully elongated products Fig. 2 . We therefore conclude that 6-4 PP does not completely inhibit in vitro DNA synthesis by Pold indeed , we may have underestimated the amount of incorporated nucleotides opposite the UV photo-product because a substantial fraction of these may be removed by the proofreading activity of Pold . To more accurately measure Pold-dependent DNA synthesis over the UV photoproducts , we purified mutant Pold deficient in 3��5� exonuclease activity [ Pold exo- ] . To this end , we replaced the conserved Asp402 residue of the exonuclease domain with Ala . The yield of purified Pold exo-holoenzyme was the same as intact Pold wt Fig. 1 , indicating that the mis-sense mutation did not affect protein stability . We evaluated the 3��5� exonuclease activity by incubating purified Pold with a 5� biotin-labeled single-strand ss oligonucleotide Figs 1 and 3 . As expected , Pold wt digested this ssDNA in a dose-dependent manner , whereas Pold exo-showed no detectable nuclease activity Fig. 3 . It is known that the dNTP concentration affects the 3��5� exonuclease activity of some DNA polyme-rases Brutlag Kornberg 1972 . To investigate this issue in our system , we incubated Pold wt and the 5� end labeled ssDNA with various concentrations of dNTPs and measured the digestion of this ssDNA . Without dNTPs , more than half of the primer was degraded Fig. 3 . In contrast , the addition of dNTPs suppressed the degradation of the ssDNA substrate in a dNTP concentration-dependent manner Fig. 3 . We therefore conclude that the exonuclease activity is indeed considerably suppressed by dNTPs . We subsequently analyzed in vitro DNA synthesis with a physiological dNTP concentration of 10 lM , A wt exo-Polymerase 0 50 25 10 5 1 50 25 10 5 1 ng mL B which is observed in cycling human cells 0.4�17 lM Jamburuthugoda et al. 2006 . By evaluating the effi-ciency of DNA synthesis on undamaged template DNA strands by measuring the amount of fully elon-gated products , we demonstrated that Pold exo-showed higher efficiency of DNA synthesis compared with Pold wt . Loss of the exonuclease activity might suppress the digestion of synthesized DNA and thereby leads to the augment of in vitro DNA synthe-sis product Fig . 4A , B . Loss of the 3��5� exonuclease activity increased the capability of Pold to carry out TLS across CPD and 6-4 PP To measure the inhibitory effect of Pold�s proofread-ing activity on TLS , we compared the DNA synthesis by Pold wt and Pold exo-on lesion-containing CTA ... .CTGCTC-5 ? TT -ATGATG-3 -TACTAC ? ? 5 3 nM templates . With 10 lM dNTPs , Pold wt stalled after the incorporation of only a single base , probably opposite the 3� T of CPD or 6-4 PP Fig. 4C . At this physiological dNTP concentration , the efficiency of Pold-dependent TLS across CPD and 6-4 PP was significantly reduced compared to TLS with 100 lM dNTPs compare Figs 2 and 4C . As expected , the amount of the unextended radio-labeled primer was significantly increased after incubation with Pold exo-than after incubation with Pold wt , indicating that the primer may have been digested by the exo-nuclease activity of Pold wt . Remarkably , we repro-ducibly detected a weak but significant band corresponding to fully elongated products even when we used the damage-containing templates . Taken together , with 10 lM dNTPs , Pold exo-is able to fully extend DNA synthesis , whereas Pold wt can insert only a single nucleotide opposite the 5� T of 6-4 PP . Analysis of Pold exo -- dependent bypass products across CPD and 6-4 PP We next analyzed the nucleotide sequences of TLS products generated by Pold exo- . To obtain suffi-cient amounts of TLS products for cloning from the in vitro synthesis reaction , we increased the dNTP concentration to 100 lM . On both 6-4 PP-and CPD-containing templates , Pold exo-produced significant amounts of full-length products , containing 30 and 31 nucleotides Fig. 5A , B . The 31-nucleotide product may be generated by a one-nucleotide addi-tion to the 30-nucleotide product by the terminal transferase activity of Pold exo - , because this activity is shared by a number of prokaryotic and eukaryotic DNA polymerases Clark 1988 . In marked contrast to replication of CPD-containing templates , in the primer extension past 6-4 PP , Pold exo-yielded dominant bands corresponding to 27 and 28 nucleo-tides � 3 nucleotides shorter than the sizes of the fully elongated 30-and 31-nucleotide products Fig. 5A , B . We assumed that these shorter products were caused by 3-nucleotide slippage events during the bypass of 6-4 PP . The percentage of synthesized products was 14 % for 30-and 31-nucleotide products and 21 % for 27-and 28-nucleotide ones Fig. 5B . To confirm the slippage event , we cloned fully elongated DNA synthesis products and analyzed their nucleotide sequences . To this end , the primer exten-sion reaction was repeated using a biotin-labeled primer annealed to CPD-or 6-4 PP-containing templates . Elongated products were affinity-purified through the interaction between the biotin tag and streptavidin on magnetic beads . Figure 5C shows the nucleotide sequences opposite 5�-CTT-3� carrying CPD or 6-4 PP . Indeed , more than 80 % of the 6-4 PP bypass products contained a 3-nucleotide deletion opposite this UV lesion . This result is consistent with the predominant bands corresponding to 27 and 28 nucleotides Fig. 5A , which are 3 nucleotides shorter than fully elongated 30-and 31-nucleotide products . We therefore conclude that Pold exo-can bypass 6-4 PP through replication slippage by looping out three nucleotides carrying , including the 6-4 PP lesion . We also analyzed bypass products of the CPD-containing template strand . Remarkably , 38 % of fully elongated products were error-free , whereas 58 % of the bypass products carried A to T transversion muta-tions opposite the 5� T of CPD Fig. 5C . Taken together , although Pold exo-is able to efficiently perform DNA synthesis over 6-4 PP and CPD in the presence of 100 lM dNTPs , the fidelity of this repli-cative polymerase is remarkably limited . To measure the preference of nucleotides inserted by Pold opposite UV photoproducts at a physiologi-cal dNTP concentration 10 lM , we performed the in vitro nucleotide incorporation assay with each of the four dNTPs separately . The insertion of nucleotides opposite CPD and 6-4 PP is shown in Fig. 6 upper panel . Consistent with the sequence data of the fully elongated product , Pold efficiently incorporated only A opposite the 3� T of CPD Fig. 6 . In contrast , during the bypass of 6-4 PP , whereas incorporation of A was the most efficient , we found that G was also very efficiently incorporated opposite the 3� T of 6-4 PP Fig. 6 . These preferences are distinct from those of Poli , which displays no such bias Tissier et al. 2000 , suggesting that the catalytic center of Poli might be more open than is Pold , and thereby accommodates the base pairing of any nucleotide with the 3� T of 6-4 PP . We next examined the preference of nucleotide insertion after Pold incorporates A opposite the 3� T of the UV photoproducts . To this end , we mea-sured the insertion of individual dNTPs using a 17mer primer , which carries an additional A at its 3� end Fig. 1 . The efficiency of the second nucleotide insertion is shown in Fig. 6 lower panel . As expected , the overall efficiency of the second CTA ... ... ... . . CTGCTC 5�-ATGATG 3�-TACTAC nucleotide insertion was lower than that of the first insertion event Fig. 6 . This limited efficiency of second insertion is probably caused by an abnormal primer ? template structure , such as results from mis-matched base pairing . We found that Pold preferen-tially inserted A and T with a similar efficiency opposite the 5� T of the UV photoproducts in this second insertion step Fig. 6 . These observations , together with our sequence data Fig. 5 , showed that bypass across UV photoproducts by Pold is remarkably mutagenic . 31 30 31 30 29 28 27 nt CPD 6-4 PP Bypass of 6-4 PP by Pold exo-was associated with slippage event Fig. 5 . We considered three possible mechanisms for the 3-nt looped-out template Fig. 7A . One is the 6-4 PP-dependent loop forma-tion model , in which highly distorted 6-4 PP promotes 3-nt loop including 6-4 PP Fig. 7A , upper . The sec-ond possible mechanism is sequence-dependent slip-page model , in which two consecutive ATG sequence in the 3� end of the primer strand is looped out , which allows extension by Pold of an additional copy of ATG before bypassing lesion site . Then , the second slippage occurs such that the most 3� ATG at the primer end anneals to a CAT 5� to the lesion Fig. 7A , middle . The third possible mechanism is the other sequence-dependent loop formation model , in which Pold first incorporates A opposite 3� of T-T dimmer , and this nascent A pairs with nondamaged T on the template Fig. 7A , lower . We wished to verify which of the mechanism underlies slippage event of Pold and used other three templates , which locates T at 2 , 4 and 9 nt upstream from the 3� T of the lesion site Figs 1 and 7B , a . If the looping out occurs sequence indepen-dently , products from all templates may accompany 3-bp deletion Fig. 7B . If the sequential looping out and slippage at the ATG repeat in the primer causes 3-bp deletion , products from these three templates may not have deletion , as these templates do not possess CAT 5� to the lesion . If the looping out is promoted by the third model , these template strands result in 2 , 4 and 9 nt looping out Fig. 7B , b�d . Consistent with the third model , when we used AAT template that allows 2 nt looping out , 2-bp deletion was detected Fig. 7C . Interestingly , we detected no deletion event , when we used template TAC and AAC , in which 4 and 9 nt looping out was allowed . These results suggest that slippage event of Pold is highly dependent on the sequence context of template strand and Pold exo-allows up to 3 nt looping out of template strand during bypass of 6-4 PP . More importantly , Pold exo-bypassed 6-4 PP and fully synthesized DNA on all templates carrying 6-4 PP , indicating bypass of 6-4 PP by Pold exo-is not dependent on the sequence context of the template . It is believed that the extraordinarily high accuracy of Pold is intimately associated with its incapability to C T 5�-.ATGATG A-3� AAT TAC AAC undergo DNA synthesis over damaged nucleotides on the template strand . We show here that Pold can bypass 6-4 PP , although no other single eukaryotic DNA polymerase can do so Seki Wood 2008 . The ability of Pold to bypass 6-4 PP is surprising for the following reasons . First , 6-4 PP causes a pronounced distortion in the DNA backbone and thereby strongly interferes with the Watson�Crick base pairing Yamamoto et al. 2008 . Therefore , a nucleotide opposite 6-4 PP on template strands is unlikely to fit in the catalytic core of any DNA polymerase . Second , crystal structure analysis of the yeast Pold catalytic site showed that the catalytic site of Pold recognizes a mis - match with extremely high accuracy and can poten-tially discriminate a mismatch even 4 base pairs away from the error by directly sensing Watson�Crick geometry Swan et al. 2009 . Third , no TLS polymer-ase has been reported to bypass 6-4 PP by itself in vitro . In fact , Seki et al. reported that the sequential action of Poli and Polh , but not either polymerase alone , allows for TLS across 6-4 PP Seki Wood 2008 . For these reasons , the capability of Pold to carry out TLS across 6-4 PP was totally unexpected . While we have referred to a dNTP concentration of 10 lM as physiological , the effective concentration of dNTPs at stalled replication forks in vivo is almost certainly higher than this and may increase to 100 lM . Indeed , the dNTP concentration significantly varies depending on the phase of the cell cycle and the cell type , for example , dNTP concentrations increase upto seven times and reach 50 lM in actively cycling cancer cells Traut 1994 . Moreover , ribonucleotide reduc-tase , which catalyzes the de novo synthesis of dNTPs , is recruited to damaged DNA sites and may dramatically increase the concentration of dNTPs locally at the site of DNA repair Niida et al. 2010 . Furthermore , if the dNTP concentration is increased at stalled replication forks , the enzymatic mode of Pold may be changed from error-free to error-prone and thereby carry out the bypass of damaged templates efficiently . This view is supported by the fact that an increase in the concen-tration of dNTPs activates the TLS capability of yeast replicative polymerase and suppresses the sensi-tivity of a yeast strain that lacks all TLS polymerases to 4-NQ , a UV-mimetic DNA-damaging agent Sabouri et al. 2008 . We therefore favor the idea that efficient in vitro TLS by Pold with 100 lM dNTPs might have relevance to in vivo DNA synthesis . The sequence analysis of bypass products showed that 6-4 PP lesion bypass by Pold exo-is accompa-nied by slippage event . Moreover , we showed that this slippage event is dependent on the sequence context of the template . Pold first incorporates A opposite the 3� T of 6-4PP lesion site , which hybridizes with T locat-ing at the upstream from the lesion and thus stabilizes the looped-out structure Fig. 7A , lower . Our results also indicate that pold allows looping out up to 3 nucleotides including the 6-4 PP itself during bypasses of 6-4 PP . Therefore , slippage event occurs only when template sequence allows up to 3-bp looping out . This nucleotide slippage reflects a prominent enzymatic property of Pold , because slippage events occur very frequently at repeated sequences in mis-match repair-deficient cells Shah et al. 2010 . In vitro DNA synthesis by Pold is also frequently associated with slippage events , as single-and multibase deletions are observed more frequently in comparison with base substitutions Fortune et al. 2005 . This view is sub-stantiated by the recent structural analysis of Escherichia coli PolII the bacterial Pold homologue , which showed that the cavity-like structure in the catalytic domain of E. coli PolII supplies enough room for the looped-out template DNA and thereby allows slippages Wang Yang 2009 . Similarly , yeast Pold Pol3 possesses a cavity-like flexible structure in the catalytic domain Fig. S4A , B in Supporting Information . The high degree of sequence conservation between human and yeast suggests that human Pold also possesses the corresponding features to yeast Pold Fig. S4C in Supporting Information . In this study , we showed novel enzymatic property of Pold in TLS , but the efficiency of bypass across 6-4 PP in the physiological concentration of dNTP is limited even for Pold exo-approximately 0.5 % Fig. 4 . It should be important to address the rele-vance of this enzymatic property of Pold in vivo . Expression and purification of Pold wt and Pold exo-enzymes To construct the Pold exo -- mutant gene , point mutations were introduced so as to change Asp to Ala at amino acid residue 402 of p125 by PCR . The primer sequences used in the muta-genesis are 5�-CCAGAACTTCGCCCTTCCGTACC-3� and 5�-GGTACGGAAGGGCGAAGTTCTGG-3� . Pold recombi-nant enzymes with p125 wt or exo - , p66 , p12 and N-terminal His-tagged p50 were expressed , using a pBacPAK9 vector Clontech in High Five cells as described previously Masutani et al. 1999b . A His-tagged Pold complex was prepared from insect cells as described previously Shikata et al. 2001 . The concentration and purity of purified proteins were estimated from the intensity of the bands in a Coomassie Blue-stained polyacrylamide gel Fig. S1 in Supporting Information . p12 subunit was not detectable in a Coomassie Blue staining . Measurement of exonuclease activity Various concentrations of Pold were mixed with 0.5 lM of 5�-labeled 51mer ssDNA 5�-TTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT TTTTTACGACGTTGTAAAAGGACGGGCCAGT-3� in 5 lL buffer 30 mM HEPES pH7.5 , 7 mM MgCl2 , 500 lM DTT , 50 lg ? mL BSA and varying concentrations of dNTPs and incubated for 15 min at 37 ? C . The 5-lL reaction mixture was terminated by adding 1 lL of 10� loading buffer Takara . After the reaction , the products were separated by 7.5 % small polyacrylamide gel 7 � 8.5 cm 7.5 % acrylamide , 0.35 % bisacrylamide , 0.5� TBE and transferred to the Biodyne B Nylon Membrane PALL . After UV fixation , Biotinylated 51mer ssDNA was detected using Chemiluminescent Nucleic Acid Detection Module Thermo scientific according to the manufacturer�s instructions . A concentration of 0.06 pmol of 5� 32P-labeled 16mer primer 5�-CACTGACTGTATGATG-3� was annealed to 0.04 pmol of 30mer oligonucleotide template DNA 5�-CTCGTCAGC ATCTTCATCATACAGTCAGTG-3� underlined nucleo-tides indicate the position of TT UV photoproduct for dam-aged template and incubated for 15 min in a 5-lL reaction mixture containing 30 mM HEPES�NaOH pH 7.4 , 7 mM MgCl2 , 8 mM NaCl , 0.5 mM dithiothreitol and 10 or 100 lM dNTPs at 37 ? C , in the presence of 100 nM PCNA and 2 , 6 or 20 nM Pold . The reaction was terminated by adding 5 lL of 2� formamide dye 98 % deionized formamide , 10 mM EDTA , 0.025 % xylene cyanol , 0.025 % BPB . The denatured products were loaded onto 15.6 % polyacrylamide gels contain-ing 7 M urea in TBE buffer 89 mM Tris , 89 mM boric acid , 2 mM EDTA . After electrophoresis , radioactivity was mea-sured with a Fuji Image analyzer , FLA2500 Fujifilm . In the time-course analysis , the reaction was performed in 50-lL scale , and in each time point , 5 lL of reactant was mixed with 2� formamide dye to terminate reaction . Sequence analysis of the fully elongated products A concentration of 0.12 pmol of 5� biotin-labeled primer was annealed to 30mer templates and used in a primer extension reaction . Each template was assayed in a reaction containing 100 lM dNTPs and 20 nM Pold exo- . The extended products were purified by DYNABEADS M-280 STREPTAVIDIN DYNAL according to the manufacturer�s instructions . Six femtomol of the purified primers was polyadenylated using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase TdT and 0.25 mM dATP . After PCR amplification using the forward primer 5�-CACTGACTGTATGATG-3� and reverse primer 5�-TT TTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT-3� , the products were cloned to PCR-TOPO vector Invitrogen and sequenced using the M13 primer .

21072054	Gliomas are the most common type of brain tumor , and grade IV glioblastomas are almost universally fatal . Treatment of glioblastomas typically involves surgical resection in combi-nation with radiation and alkylating agent-based adjuvant chemotherapy . However , even in instances in which complete surgical resection of theses tumors is possible , the tumor generally recurs within a year , regardless of its initial response to treatment.1 Oncogenes EGF , PDGF , and their receptors and tumor suppressor genes p16INK4a , p14ARF , PTEN , RB1 , and TP53 are involved in the evolution of glioblastomas , 2 and activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase PI3K signal-ing pathway has a crucial role in their development.3 The tumor suppressor gene PTEN encodes a lipid phosphatase that counteracts the effect of PI3K signaling , thereby negatively controlling the activation of this pathway . Tumor suppressor PTEN is mutationally and transcriptionally inacti-vated in many different tumor types , including glioblastoma.3 A central node in signaling events downstream of PI3K is controlled by the serine-threonine kinase AKT . Therefore , AKT is activated by PI3K , which generates phosphatidylino-sitol 3 , 4 , 5-trisphosphate , and is negatively regulated by phospholipid phosphatases PTEN.4 Hyperactivated AKT provides protection from apoptosis and promotes uncon-trolled cell cycle progression.5 However , it has recently been shown that AKT activity increases with cellular senescence , and that inhibition of AKT extends the lifespan of primary cultured human endothelial cells.6 Cellular senescence is an extremely stable form of cell cycle arrest , which is activated in response to stress , including oncogenic signaling and telomere shortening.7 The initial description of cellular senescence by Hayflick and Moorehead was based on the endurable analysis of normal human cells grown in vitro.8 In contrast to cancer cells , they observed that normal cells had a finite proliferative capacity that ended in stable and long-term cell cycle arrest . Considering that neoplastic transformation involves events that inhibit the program of senescence , tumor cells were believed to have lost the ability to senescence . However , recent data has shown that tumor cells can be readily induced to undergo senescence by genetic manipulation , or by treatment with chemotherapeutic drugs , radiation , or differentiation agents.9 The importance of cellular senescence is increasingly being recognized as a tumor suppression mechanism.10,11 Here , we show that after ionizing radiation IR exposure , PTEN acts as a critical determinant of cell fate between senescence and apoptosis in the glioma cell lines U87 , U251 , U373 , LN18 , and LN428 . The U87 , U252 , and U373 cells underwent senescence by p21 induction because of mutation or deficiency of PTEN . However , LN428 and LN18 cells , which express wild-type wt PTEN , displayed apoptotic , as opposed to senescent , phenotypes after IR exposure . Further examinations suggest that premature senescence could be an alternative mechanism to prevent aberrant cell prolifera-tion , instead of apoptosis , in the absence of the tumor suppressor PTEN . Results PTEN status dictates premature senescent and apoptotic phenotypes in glioma cells following IR exposure . To test whether the cellular response of glioma to IR is associated with PTEN status , we exposed several glioma cell lines , including PTEN-deficient U87 , U251 , and U373 and the PTEN-proficient LN18 and LN428 cells to various doses of IR . We first examined relative cell numbers and cellular morphologies , and observed that all cell types had decreased cell numbers in a dose-dependent manner following IR Figure 1a . Furthermore , microscopic analyses indicated that U87 , U251 , and U373 cells were positive for senescence-associated b-galactosidase SA-b-Gal , a hall-mark of senescence , and for senescent morphology large flattened shape Figure 1b . In contrast , LN18 and LN428 cells became susceptible to trypan blue staining , and dis-played Annexin V positivity , in a dose-dependent manner Figure 1c . Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 , one of senescence markers , was dramatically increased in PTEN-deficient U87 , U251 , and U373 cells , but not in PTEN-proficient LN18 and LN428 cells , and cleaved poly ADP-ribose polymerase PARP , which is an indicator of the biochemical changes due to caspase activation during apoptosis was detected only in LN18 and LN428 cells U373 LN18 LN428 -Gal cells 80 U373 LN18 LN428 different *Po0.01 versus C Figure 1d . Caspase-3 7 activity and pro-caspase 3 cleavage were also increased in dose-and time-dependent manners to exposure to IR in LN18 and LN428 cells Supplementary Figure S1 . These data suggest that decreased cell numbers after exposure to IR are due to premature senescence in PTEN-deficient cells , and due to apoptosis in PTEN-proficient cells , regardless of p53 status . In PTEN-deficient PC-3 and PTEN-proficient DU145 prostate cancer cells , we observed cellular responses to IR that were very similar to those in glioma Supplementary Figure S2 . c 120 % 100 V 0 C 10 20 C 10 20 C 10 20 C 10 20 C 10 20 C 10 20 C 10 20 C 10 20 C 10 20 C 10 20 after ionizing radiation IR exposure . The PTEN-deficient or -proficient glioma cell lines were treated with 20 or 40 Gy of IR , and 10 or 20 mg ml of doxorubicin . Cellular PTEN-deficient gliomas adopt different final cell fates depending on stimulus type . As IR induced senescence in PTEN-deficient cells and apoptosis in PTEN-proficient cells , we next tested the effect of higher doses of IR and treatment with the genotoxic drug doxorubicin on the same cell types . When treated with 20 or 40 Gy of IR or with 10 or 20 mg ml doxorubicin , all glioma cell numbers decreased , as compared with proliferating control cells Figure 2a . As described before , PTEN-deficient U87 , U251 , and U373 cells were positive for SA-b-Gal staining after 20 or 40 Gy of IR exposure , indicating that they underwent senescence Figure 2b . However , doxorubicin treatment induced apoptosis in PTEN-deficient cells , as evidenced by Annexin V positivity and PARP cleavage Figure 2c and d , whereas PTEN-proficient LN18 and LN428 cells underwent apoptosis , regardless of stimulus type Figure 2a�d . Levels of p21 increased after administration of high doses of IR , but not in doxorubicin-treated U87 , U251 , and U373 cells , and neither treatment induced p21 expression in LN18 nor LN428 cells Figure 2d . We could not detect expression of other cell cycle regulatory proteins such as p16 and p14 data not shown , consistent with prior data showing they are deleted in all glioma cell lines used in this study except U373.12 Cleaved PARP was observed in doxorubicin-treated U87 , U251 , and U373 cells and in LN18 and LN428 cells treated with high doses of IR or doxorubicin . Caspase-3 7 activity and pro-caspase 3 cleavage were detected in doxorubicin-treated U87 , U251 , U373 , LN18 , and LN428 cells Supple-mentary Figure S3 . In contrast with the response to IR , these data demonstrate that PTEN-deficient cells underwent apoptosis , not senescence , as a result of doxorubicin treatment . This indicates that PTEN-deficient cells could activate either apoptosis or senescence pathways , depending on the type of cellular stimulus . When we applied hydrogen peroxide H2O2 to U87 and LN18 cells to examine cellular responses to other stimuli in the presence or the absence of PTEN , LN18 cells showed dramatic increases in the number of trypan blue positive cells and PARP cleavage , and no induction of p21 , as compared with U87 cells Supplementary Figure S4 . Reactive oxygen species are essential for the induction of senescence in U87 cells , but not for apoptosis in LN18 cells . We next examined molecular changes of senescence in PTEN-deficient U87 cells , and those of apoptosis in PTEN-proficient LN18 cells , over time following IR treat-ment . Both cell types had an immediate reduction in cell number and in morphological changes , and as before , only U87 cells had increased SA-b-Gal staining Figure 3a . Furthermore , the increase in apoptotic cells , which was detected using Annexin V assay , was evidently observed in LN18 cells Figure 3b , as we previously observed . As shown in Figure 3c , LN18 cells exhibited dramatic increases in PTEN , mutant p53 , and cleaved PARP . However , phospho-AKT S473 and p21 induction were not detected . In contrast , U87 cells were characterized by gradual increases in phospho-AKT , wt p53 , and p21 Figure 3c . There were no detectable PARP cleavage and PTEN induction in U87 cells . We tested for reactive oxygen species ROS production in U87 and LN18 cells to know whether there was difference in the levels of ROS between premature senescence and apoptosis . Reactive oxygen species increased in both cell lines , and U87 cells exhibited significantly higher intracellular ROS levels than LN18 cells Figure 3d , left panel . As it has been known that active AKT could reduce MnSOD and catalase expression by inhibition of Forkhead box O 1 3 FOXO1 3 , 5 and AKT activation was detected in U87 cells after IR exposure in this study , we next tested for levels of phospho-FOXO1 3 , MnSOD , and catalase . We observed no effect of IR on FOXO1 3 phosphorylation or levels of MnSOD , Cu ZnSOD , or catalase in U87 and LN18 glioma Figure 3d , middle panel , indicating that increased ROS levels were not attributed to FOXO1 3 phosphorylation or the decrease of antioxidant enzymes in either of the cell lines . As mitochon-drial ROS are the major source of intracellular ROS , we next measured fluorescence of MitoSOX Red as a mitochondrial superoxide indicator Figure 3d , right panel . Fluorescence intensity of MitoSOX Red was increased in both the cell lines and more significantly in U87 cells , consistent with increased intracellular ROS levels . To verify the role of ROS in senescence or apoptosis induced by IR , we treated U87 and LN18 cells with the ROS scavenger N-acetyl-l-cysteine NAC before IR exposure Figure 4a . Whereas NAC blocked induction of senescence in U87 cells , it did not inhibit apoptotic cell death in LN18 cells Figure 4b�d . Relative cell numbers were decreased both in IR-treated and in NAC and IR co-treated LN18 cells Figure 4b , and the percentage of apoptotic cells and PARP cleavage were not recovered by treatment of LN18 cells with NAC Figure 4c and d . Likewise , we observed no increase in SA-b-Gal activity and p21 induction in LN18 cells Figure 4c and d . In contrast , pretreatment of U87 cells with NAC before exposure to IR , reduced SA-b-Gal staining , wt p53 activation , and p21 induction , which had been induced by IR exposure Figure 4c and d . However , AKT activation and PARP cleavage were not affected here Figure 4d , and total cell number and percentage of apoptotic cells were not increased Figure 4b and c . Together , these data suggest that ROS generation , likely through the upstream AKT and the downstream p53 p21 signaling pathways , is indispensable for the induction of senescence phenotypes , but not apoptosis , in glioma . Wild-type PTEN expression or AKT depletion shifts premature senescence to apoptosis in IR-exposed U87 glioma . We clarified the role of PTEN AKT in cellular senescence by transfecting either wt PTEN or AKT small interfering RNA siRNA into U87 cells . Overall , we observed that transfection of either wt PTEN or AKT siRNA induced apoptosis instead of senescence as responses to IR exposure . Increases in SA-b-Gal activity and intracellular ROS levels , which were because of IR exposure , were reduced by wt PTEN expression Figure 5a , right panel , and c . Annexin V-positive cells and caspase-3 7 activity were increased , and cleaved PARP was detected instead of p21 induction Figure 5b and d . Furthermore , cells transfected with wt PTEN alone showed apoptotic morphology and PARP cleavage Figure 5a , middle panel , and d , and also resulted in decreased cell number and increased percentage of apoptotic cells Figure 5a and b . When we further examined IR response in AKT siRNA-transfected U87 cells , AKT depletion also shifted cells from premature senescence to apoptosis as a response to IR Figure 6 , as observed in wt PTEN-expressing cells Figure 5 . AKT depletion resulted in decreases in both SA-b-Gal activity and intracellular ROS levels Figure 6a and c . Annexin V positivity , PARP cleavage , and caspase-3 7 activation in Figure 6b and d were evidently increased because of AKT depletion , as opposed to p21 induction and SA-b-Gal staining . These data confirm that PTEN is critical not only for the regulation of cell viability under normal conditions , but also for the induction of senescence under conditions of stress , through AKT . c The p53 p21 signaling pathway is essential for the induction of IR-induced senescent phenotypes in U87 cells . We next tested if IR-induced senescence requires signaling of the p53 p21 pathway in U87 cells . We trans-fected siRNA specific for p53 into U87 cells expressing wt p53 , and looked for senescent phenotypes Figure 7 . In p53 siRNA transfected cells before IR exposure , p21 expression was not induced Figure 7c , and cells showed decreased SA-b-Gal activity Figure 7a , right panel . When we exam-ined whether the absence of p53 could trigger apoptosis instead of senescence , increased apoptotic cells , caspase-3 7 activity , and PARP cleavage were not detected Figure 7b and c . Furthermore , increases in intracellular ROS and mitochondrial superoxide , which were observed in U87 cells after IR exposure , were not affected in p53 siRNA-transfected cells Figure 7d , left and middle panels . Decrease in S-phase entry , which was detected using bromodeoxyuridine BrdU incorporation assay , was not reverted in p53 siRNA-transfected cells Figure 7d , right panel . Although a small increase in SA-b-Gal positive cells was observed in p53-depleted cells , both SA-b-Gal activity and morphological changes were observed only after IR exposure in control siRNA-transfected cells , indicating that p53 is involved in IR-induced senescence in U87 cells . Cells transfected with p21 siRNA before IR exposure showed phenotypes similar to those transfected with p53 siRNA Figure 8 . IR-induced senescence phenotypes were not 1.2 cell 0.2 * # NAC NAC NAC NAC detected , such as SA-b-Gal activity Figure 8a , middle and right panels . Likewise , evidence of apoptosis was not detected after p21-siRNA transfection , such as increases in apoptotic cell , caspase-3 7 activity , and PARP cleavage Figure 8b and c . Finally , increase in intracellular ROS level originated from mitochondria and cell cycle arrest were not returned to control levels Figure 8d . These data suggest that depletion of either p53 or p21 directs PTEN-deficient U87 cells towards cytostatic that is , cell cycle arrest characteristics , rather than to apoptosis . When we analyzed cell cycle distribution , p53-or p21-depleted cells exhibited increases in aneuploid cells 44N data not IR IR + + shown , which has been reported as a cause of cytostasis.13,14 Altogether , the p53 p21 signaling pathway is critical for the induction of senescent phenotypes by IR exposure in PTEN-deficient U87 glioma . As we detected increases in another cell cycle inhibitor p27 in both p53 siRNA-and p21 siRNA-transfected cells Figure 7c and 8c , we next co-transfected cells with p27 siRNA and either p21 siRNA or p53 siRNA to examine the role of p27 in such cytostatic state . Transfection with p27 siRNA did not affect the cytostatic status of p53 siRNA-or p21 siRNA-transfected cells Figure 8e . This could be because of additional roles of PTEN , independent of AKT , such as Discussion Senescent cells are characterized by irreversible cell cycle arrest , although they remain metabolically active and acquire specific properties , such as large and flattened morphological changes , SA-b-Gal staining based on lysosomal b-galacto-sidase activity at pH 6.0 , resistance to apoptosis , and altered gene expression.16 More than 50 years after Hayflick and Moorehead reported replicative senescence in normal human fibroblasts , recent evidence has suggested that cellular senescence is a defense mechanism against tumorigenesis in vivo.17 In addition , as cellular senescence is abundant in premalignant neoplastic lesions and tumor regression is attributed to cellular senescence , this process is considered to have a crucial role in tumor treatment.18,19 Indeed , if cellular senescence pathways remain intact , senescence induction could compensate for the inactivation of the apoptotic path-way and could be triggered with low doses of chemo-therapeutic drugs or IR.20 Therefore , it is possible that improved tumor treatments could be developed by under-standing the mechanism of premature senescence.9 Gliomas are the most common malignant brain tumor in adults and are among the most lethal of all cancers.21,22 EV + IR wt PTEN + IR % * 80 -Gal cells 60 protein phosphatase activity.15 The mechanism regarding the cytostatic status in p53-and p21-depleted cells needs to be clarified by further experiments . Glioblastomas contain a number of clearly defined genetic lesions , which result in disruption of critical cellular signaling pathways that regulate cell proliferation . Activation of the AKT oncogene by mutational inactivation of the PTEN tumor suppressor , or mutational activation of PI3K , is common in glioblastomas.23 As these genetic lesions regulate biological and clinical behaviors of tumor cells , the resultant disrupted signaling pathways represent attractive targets for therapy.24 The aim of this study was to elucidate whether PTEN status could alter cellular responses to IR using five different glioma cell lines . We found that PTEN-deficient U87 , U373 , and U252 glioma cells , which have an active AKT signaling pathway because of the absence of PTEN , entered senes-cence following IR exposure . However , the PTEN-proficient cell lines LN428 and LN18 underwent apoptosis under the same treatment conditions . AKT has crucial roles not only in the proliferation and survival of mammalian cells , thereby promoting tumorigenesis , but also for the induction of premature senescence.6,25 In this study , U87 cells depleted of either p53 or p21 did not develop a senescent phenotype , but instead remained cytostatic as opposed to triggering apoptosis in response to activated AKT.26,27 In addition , acute PTEN inactivation induces growth arrest through the p53-dependent cellular senescence pathway both in vitro and in vivo.28 PTEN AKT might exert another regulatory func-tion s of cell proliferation through a p53 p21-independent pathway . For example , as PTEN has recently been reported Annexin to have protein phosphatase activity in addition to lipid phosphatase activity , 15 PTEN may have additional roles in tumor biology , independent of AKT activity and the senes-cence pathway . As we found that p27 , another cell cycle inhibitor , did not have a role in the cytostatic status of p53-and p21-depleted cells , additional experiments will need to be performed before the details regarding this mechanism are understood . Although the PI3K AKT pathway is involved in both premature senescence and cell proliferation , the specific mechanism related to this process is not fully understood . Here , we observed that different responses by glioma cell lines are dependent on PTEN status , and that PTEN has a critical role in switching cell fate between senescence and apoptosis after IR exposure . We also found that depletion of AKT or scavenging of ROS prevented IR-induced senes-cence in PTEN-deficient glioma . These data suggest that the effect of PTEN on cellular senescence is likely mediated by increased intracellular ROS by AKT activation . Since the discovery that H2O2 can induce apoptosis , many reports have demonstrated the importance of ROS in the apoptotic pathway in various cell systems.29,30 However , it has also been reported that significant levels of ROS are produced in senescing cells , but not in apoptotic cells.31 Similar studies have shown that ROS are also produced in cells undergoing apoptotic-like cell death , but that the produced ROS do not cause apoptosis.32 In this study , we observed that ROS were not required to induce apoptosis in PTEN-proficient glioma . Recent reports suggested that constitutive activation of AKT promotes senescence-like arrest of cell growth through inhibition of the transcription factor FOXO1 3.6,33 Inhibition of FOXO1 3 increases intracellular ROS through the regulation of antioxidant enzymes levels , such as MnSOD , sestrin , and catalase , and many experiments have shown that ROS have a critical role in determining life span and cellular senescence in mammalian cells.5 In this study , ROS levels were elevated during IR-induced senescence , and the ROS scavenger NAC reverted IR-induced senescence pheno-types , including p53 activation , p21 induction , and SA-b-Gal activity . However , increases in intracellular ROS levels were not attributed to the phosphorylation of FOXO1 3 through AKT activation . Radiotherapy RT is one of major regimes for cancer therapy , and research in radiation biology is currently focused on identifying more effective means to increase RT efficacy.34 It is accepted that apoptosis has a primary role in tumor regression after RT , and many studies have attempted to elucidate applicable mechanisms to increase cells under-going apoptosis in RT-targeted tumors.35,36 It has been known that apoptosis is readily induced in tumors derived from hematopoietic , lymphoid , and germ cells , but some solid tumors derived from epithelial cells show resistance to apoptosis after IR exposure.37,38 Recent evidence has shown that IR prematurely induces senescent phenotypes , instead of apoptosis , before the Hayflick limit , which is known as stress-induced premature senescence . We also previously reported that IR induces premature senescence in breast , colon , and lung carcinoma , and in tumor tissue of xenografted mice.20,39 Therefore , understanding premature senescence mechan-isms could provide helpful information for improving the efficacy of RT . In this study , we describe for the first time a detailed molecular mechanism of IR-induced senescence in PTEN-deficient glioma . Premature senescence has a compensatory role in apoptosis in the absence of the tumor suppressor PTEN through the AKT ROS p53 p21 pathway , whereas PTEN proficiency sensitizes glioma cells to apoptosis , independently of p53 and ROS Figure 8f . Conclusively , our results affirm that RT-induced premature senescence could be an alternative fail-safe treatment option in apoptosis-resistant glioma cells , and we expect our findings may aid in the understanding of the clinical significance of premature senescence in PTEN-deficient tumor cells .

21072057	Erythropoiesis is a multistep process that occurs in the bone marrow and involves the sequential formation of proerythro-blasts � basophilic , polychromatic and orthochromatic � erythroblasts and enucleated reticulocytes . Terminal erythroid differentiation is characterized by hemoglobin synthesis and major morphological changes , including chromatin condensa-tion , cell size reduction and finally , nucleus extrusion to generate reticulocytes that enter in the blood circulation.1 This differentiation process involves the transcription factor GATA-1,2,3 which positively regulates promoters of erythroid genes such as glycophorin A , the erythropoietin receptor EPO-R and hemoglobin chains . Some features of terminal differentiation of erythroid cells are similar to features associated with apoptosis , such as chromatin condensation , organelle loss and membrane remodeling . Along with others , we have previously demon-strated that transient activation of effector caspases at the basophilic stage is required for terminal erythroid matura-tion.4�6 Caspases induce cleavage of several proteins involved in the nuclear structural changes observed during terminal erythroid differentiation , such as lamin B , acinus or PARP.7 In contrast , GATA-1 , a target of caspases during apoptosis , is not cleaved during differentiation , allowing expression of erythroid genes and survival . This protection of GATA-1 from cleavage by caspases is explained by the translocation into the nucleus at the onset of caspase activation of the chaperone protein HSP70 . At this stage , HSP70 interacts physically with GATA-1 resulting in protection against caspase cleavage.8 Identification of each caspase substrate might be helpful for understanding the mechanisms that determine the fate differentiation versus apoptosis of erythroid cells in different physiological or pathological conditions . Erythropoiesis is regulated by a number of growth factors . Two of these growth factors are critical and have distinct and non-redundant functions , namely the c-KIT ligand or stem cell factor SCF 9 and erythropoietin EPO .10 SCF induces an increase in cell survival and expansion of BFU-E and colony-forming unit CFU -E , and slows down the differentiation of these cells toward the basophilic stage.10,11 Thereafter , cell-surface c-KIT expression is down modulated.12 EPO , which acts synergistically with SCF from late BFU-E until the basophilic stage is strictly required for preventing apoptosis and stimulating proliferation , allowing differentiation of erythroid progenitors and precursors , from CFU-E until the polychromatophilic stage.13 In contrast , terminal maturation from polychromatophilic erythroblasts to reticulocytes occurs independently of signaling by these two cytokines . This cytokine independence of terminal maturation of erythroid precursors is a peculiar phenomenon that may depend in vivo on integrins signaling for erythroid progenitors proliferation . However , it remains to be understood by which mechanisms orthochromatic erythroblasts undergo cyto-skeleton reorganization , specifically contractile actin ring formation for extrusion of pycnotic nucleus , a process highly dependent on kinases signaling . Small GTPases of the Rho family RhoA , Rac and Cdc42 transduce signals from receptors at the plasma membrane to the actin and microtubule cytoskeleton as well as to kinase cascades that regulate cell morphology and many different processes such as motility and cell cycle progression . On activation , Rho proteins exchange GDP for GTP , transduce signals to downstream effector proteins and finally return to the inactive GDP-bound form by hydrolyzing the bound GTP.14�16 Whereas RhoA , Rac1 or Cdc42 are ubiquitously expressed , Rac2 expression is confined to the hematopoietic compartment.17 Rac GTPases are dynamic regulators of erythrocyte cytoskeleton organization18 and are required in mice for early erythropoietic expansion in the bone marrow but not in the spleen . Rac1 and Rac2 deficiency may disrupt signaling downstream of SCF and IL3 to affect bone marrow erythropoiesis . By contrast , the splenic microenvironment can circumvent this deficiency.19 Rac GTPases are required for the formation of the contractile actin ring and enucleation of mouse fetal erythroblasts.20 In contrast , the role of RhoA has not been investigated in erythroblasts . Two isoforms of a serine threonine kinase Rho-associated kinases ROCK-1 and ROCK-2 have been identified as effectors of Rho . In non-muscle cells , ROCK proteins regulate several cellular functions downstream of Rho and control actin cytoskeleton assembly and cell contractility.21 Thereby , they contribute to several physiological processes by phosphoryla-tion of various substrates such as MLC2 myosin light chain 2 phosphatase , LIM kinase and ezrin�radixin�moesin proteins . Phosphorylation of the regulatory MLC of myosin II induces its interaction with actin , which thereby activates myosin ATPase and results in enhanced cell contractility.22 Both ROCK-1 and ROCK-2 regulate MLC2 phosphorylation either directly by phosphorylating MLC2 on Ser19 or indirectly by inhibiting MLC phosphatase.23 Cleavage of the C-terminal domain of ROCK proteins results in the generation of a constitutively active kinase . This occurs in vivo during the execution phase of apoptosis , when ROCK-1 but not ROCK-2 is cleaved by caspase-3 , inducing membrane blebbing.24,25 As terminal erythroid differentiation is associated with actin filaments contractility and caspase activation , we wondered i whether the Rho ROCK signaling pathway could be involved in differentiation of erythroid progenitors ii whether ROCK-1 could be a caspase target . In this study , we show that inhibition of ROCK-1 but not Rho activity impairs erythroblasts terminal maturation . In addition , our data reveal that the Rho pathway is primarily activated by SCF c-KIT during the early stage of erythroid precursors maturation . Caspase-3-mediated cleavage of ROCK-1 allows constitutive activation from the basophilic stage to mature cells , at the time of extinction of the c-KIT Rho pathway . Therefore , we identified an additional role of caspase activation during erythroid differentiation , allowing cytokine independency . Results Rho is primarily activated through the SCF c-KIT pathway . Erythroid cells were generated with a two-step amplification culture system as described in the Materials and Methods section . In this culture system , differentiation was asynchronous and most of the cells remained immature until day 8 , after which polychromatic and orthochromatic erythroblasts were gradually generated . In these conditions , the onset of caspase-3 activation occurred at day 7�8 . As ROCK proteins are classically activated by GTP-bound Rho , we analyzed Rho expression during erythroid differ-entiation . As compared with HSC70 , used as a control for loading , the level of Rho protein decreased at the onset of caspase-3 activation Figure 1a . Pull-down analyses were performed at day 4 to determine Rho activity before the onset of caspase-3 activation . GST�RBD Rhotekin Rho-binding domain was used to pull down the active Rho-GTP form . For this purpose , CD36 cells were cytokine deprived for 8 h then stimulated by SCF , EPO or SCF ? EPO for 5 to 30 min . Rho activity peaked at 5 min data not shown and was strongly activated by SCF and to a lesser extent by EPO Figure 1b . EPO and SCF had an additive effect indicating that SCF EPO signaling is involved in Rho activation at this stage of erythroid differentiation . In contrast , when pull-down analyses were performed at day 10 after the onset of caspase-3 activation , Rho activity was equivalent to residual activity after EPO and SCF starvation for 8 h . Therefore , we could conclude that Rho is primarily activated through SCF stimulation as long as c-KIT is expressed . Thus , after the onset of caspase activation , Rho can no longer be activated because c-KIT is down modulated Figure 1c .12 Effect of ROCK-1 inhibition on cell proliferation . The requirement for ROCK function for proliferation in numerous cell types has previously been demonstrated.26 We therefore monitored the proliferation of erythroid progenitors in which ROCK-1 activity was inhibited using RNA interference . For this purpose , CD34 ? cells isolated from cord blood were infected as described with lentiviruses encoding short hairpin RNA shRNA targeting ROCK-1 mRNA . A scrambled shRNA sequence was used as a control . Western blots performed at day 6 of the CD36 lysates from selected GFP ? cells showed a 47 % reduction in ROCK-1 protein level Figure 2a demonstrating the efficacy of the shRNA . The culture condition that we used allowed massive proliferation of the erythroid progenitors with a 300-to 400-fold amplification at day 10 . Analyses using annexin V labeling along with propidium iodide PI staining showed that ROCK-1 inhibition did not significantly increase apoptosis in the culture except at the onset of caspase activation Supplementary Information 1 . ROCK-1 shRNA-infected cells had a similar proliferation rate to cells in the control culture Figure 2b . Therefore , we could conclude that ROCK-1 is not involved in erythroblast proliferation . ROCK-1 inhibition impairs terminal maturation of erythroblasts . To investigate the role of ROCK-1 in differentiation of erythroid progenitors , we first used Y-27632 , a cell-permeable compound that is specific and efficient for inhibition of the activity of both ROCK-1 and ROCK-2 . ROCK inhibitor Y-27632 was added at a concentration of 10 mM from day 0 to 12 of the CD36 culture . Terminal differentiation was analyzed by examining the morphologic features of the erythroid cells using May�Grunwald�Giemsa � staining at serial time intervals in the presence or absence of Y-27632 . Erythroid maturation was also evaluated by flow cytometric analysis of FSC�SSC cell distribution as described in the Materials and Methods section Figure 3A and by cell-surface c-KIT GPA expression that allowed quantitative assessment of the maturation stage of differentiating erythroblasts . By day 6 , the majority of erythroid cells are KITposGPAint . At the onset of caspases activation , c-KIT is down modulated and the ratio of KITnegGPAhigh is progressively increased Figures 3b and c . At day 12 of the control culture , a mean of 25.8 % �1.3 of the cells exhibited a mature phenotype polychromatic and orthochromatic erythroblasts as identified by morphological analyses . In the Y-27632 treated culture , multinucleate cells appeared at day 3 0.5�2 % . However , the proportion of these cells was low compared with 25�30 % observed with blebbistatin , a selective inhibitor of myosin II ATPase activity data not shown , suggesting that ROCK does not have a critical role in cytokinesis of early erythroblasts . At day 12 , the proportion of mature cells was dramatically decreased in the presence of the ROCK inhibitor with a mean of 12.5 % �0.9 Figure 4ai . FSC�SSC cell distribution in flow cytometric analysis , as described Figure 3 , also indicated that the Y-27632 treatment significantly increased the proportion of immature cells 39.9 % �1.6 versus 20.3 % �4.2 in controls within gate C and decreased the proportion of mature cells 11.9 % �1.1 versus 22.8 % �3.6 in controls within gate A and 4.3 % �1 versus 6.3 % �0.8 in controls within gate B Figure 4aii . Similar results were observed when the ROCK inhibitor was added at the onset of caspase activation from day 7 to 12 as assessed by morphological analyses 22.5 % �0.8 of mature cells versus 29.7 % �1.1 in controls Figure 4bi , and FSC� SSC analyses 36.3 % �3.6 versus 24.9 % �2.9 in controls within gate C , 4.2 % �1.5 versus 6.2 % �1.2 in controls within gate B and 10.9 % �1.4 versus 17.2 % �1.9 in controls within gate A Figure 4bii . Erythroid maturation was also evaluated by GPA and c-KIT cell-surface expression . Two populations with specific stain-ing characteristics were defined using flow cytometry . The populations c-KITneg GPAhigh and c-KITpos GPAint corre-sponded respectively to mature and immature cells Figure 3C . The ROCK inhibitor added from day 0 to 10 or from day 7 to 10 of the CD36 culture significantly decreased the proportion of c-KITneg GPAhigh cells 44.65�1.52 in controls , versus 25.50�3.03 in the Y-27632 treated culture , versus 32.20�3.03 when the ROCK inhibitor was added from day 7 and increased the proportion of c-KITpos GPAint cells 26.35�0.45 in controls , versus 37.40�1.44 in the Y-27632 treated culture , versus 31.50�3.46 when the ROCK inhibitor was added from day 7 Figure 4biii . Then , to discriminate between ROCK-1 and ROCK-2 function , we examined the effect of ROCK-1 knock down by RNA interference . Although shRNA partially inhibited ROCK-1 expression at day 6 Figure 2a , a significant decrease in cell maturation was observed in ROCK-1 shRNA-infected culture . At day 12 , a mean of 9.5 % �2.1 of the cells exhibited a mature phenotype versus 22.4 % �2.5 in controls Figure 4ci . FSC�SSC cell distribution analysis indicated that ROCK-1 knock-down significantly increased the proportion of immature cells 44.2 % �3.4 versus 38.9 % �2.9 in controls within gate C and decreased the proportion of mature cells 8.8 % �1.5 versus 14.4 % �0.2 in controls within gate A , and 2.2 % �0.5 versus 7.9 % �2.4 in controls within gate B Figure 4cii . The ratio of GPAhigh cells was also decreased in ROCK-1 shRNA-infected cells 27.45�2.39 versus 38.30�2.20 in scrambled Figure 4ciii . Taken together , these results suggest that ROCK-1 is involved in terminal maturation , which occurs after the onset of caspase activation . ROCK-1 is activated independently of Rho . We next investigated the mechanism of ROCK-1 activation . To determine whether ROCK-1 is dependent on Rho activity during the late stage of maturation , we overexpressed a dominant-negative form of RhoA by infecting CD36 cells with the MIGR-Rho-N19 retrovirus . To evaluate the functionality of the construct , pull-down analyses were performed with EPO-stimulated CD36 cells overexpressing the MIGR-Rho-N19 construct , which inhibited Rho activity Figure 5a . Terminal differentiation was not significantly impaired when the CD36 cells were infected with the MIGR-Rho-N19 retrovirus compared with the MIGR�GFP control retrovirus as shown by morphological Figure 5b and FACS analyses Figure 5c . This is consistent with our results showing that Rho was not activated at this stage of maturation Figure 1b . ROCK-1 is activated by caspase-3 cleavage . As caspase - 3 was shown to constitutively activate ROCK-1 during apoptosis in many cells , whereas ROCK-2 can not be cleaved by caspase-3 , western blotting of whole-cell lysates was performed at several time intervals to evaluate the possible activation of ROCK-1 through caspase-3 cleavage during erythroid differentiation . In this in vitro culture system , the percentage of cells undergoing apoptosis could reach 15�20 % at the end of differentiation . To discriminate differentiation from apoptotic ROCK-1 cleavage , day 10 annexin V-and PI-positive cells were excluded by cell sorting before cell lysis . By probing with a ROCK-1-specific antibody , in addition to the full-length 160-kDa protein , a 130-kDa fragment was detected in non-apoptotic cells from the onset of caspase-3 activation until the end of differentiation Figure 6a . Similarly , treatment of the culture during the second step of differentiation with z-VAD-fmk at a dose of 150 mM , which inhibited terminal erythroid differentiation , 4 abolished the ROCK-1 cleavage . As a control , the same 130-kDa cleavage product was present after overnight EPO starvation , strongly suggesting that this truncated ROCK-1 corresponds to the fragment generated by caspase-3 cleavage . Treatment of the CD36 culture by QVD�OPH , another broad-spectrum inhibitor of caspases , at a dose of 50 or 200 mM also abolished the Rock-1 cleavage and induced a dose-dependent decrease in terminal erythroid differentiation Supplementary Information 2 . This finding demonstrated that ROCK-1 is caspase-3 cleaved during the late step of erythropoiesis in non-apoptotic cells . To determine whether a constitutively truncated form of ROCK-1 expressed before the onset of caspase activation could affect terminal differentiation , we transiently transfected CD36 cells at day 5 of the culture with a constitutively active mutant of ROCK-1 pCAG-Myc�ROCK-1 G1114opa ROCK-1DC 24 that contains a truncated auto-inhibitory domain . This experiment was performed without SCF to rule out any activation of ROCK-1 through Rho-induced phosphorylation . For this purpose , cells were co-transfected with a mix of ROCK-1DC and a plasmid encoding GFP protein at a 4 1 ratio . The percentage of cells expressing the ROCK-1 mutant was determined after permeabilization by measuring Myc-associated fluorescence using flow cytometry . For this purpose , a gate was established above the level of auto-fluorescence seen in mock-transfected cells . The cells exhibiting Myc-associated fluorescence also exhibited GFP fluorescence Figure 6bi . Therefore , differentiation was assessed 24 and 48 h post-transfection by SSC-FSC FACS analyses on live GFP-positive cells . Cell distribution analysis indicated that the truncated ROCK-1DC construct significantly decreased cell size distribution 7.4 % �0.8 gating with mature cells versus 4.7 % �0.9 in controls Figure 6bii . Differentia-tion was also assessed by cell-surface GPA expression . For this purpose , day 5 CD36 cells were transfected with the pCAG-Myc�ROCK-1DC plasmid or with the empty vector . At 24 and 48 h post-transfection , cells were labeled for GPA then MYC after permeabilization and analyzed by flow cytometry . By 24 h post-transfection , the ratio of GPAhigh erythro-blasts was 2.2-fold increased in Myc�labeled ROCK-1DC transfected cells 8.35�2.17 versus 3.79�1.60 in controls and 2.7-fold increased by 48 h 33.35�2.83 versus 12.33�0.62 in controls Figure 6c . These results indicated that the truncated ROCK-1DC construct accelerated matura-tion . Taken together , our data demonstrate that ROCK-1 is activated through an SCF-independent mechanism , through caspase-induced cleavage , to allow erythroblast terminal maturation . ROCK-1 is the main MLC2-regulating kinase . One major role of the Rho ROCK pathway is to regulate actomyosin-based contractility by modifying the MLC2 phosphorylation status . We analyzed the expression of total MLC2 and p-MLC2 Ser 19 on CD36 ? cells at serial time intervals . The level of MLC2 decreased at the end of the CD36 culture Figure 6a . To investigate whether or not ROCK was involved in MLC2 phosphorylation , western blot analyses were performed on whole-cell lysates of the Y-27632-treated and control cultures at various times . At day 10 , to discriminate differentiation induced from apoptotic MLC2 phosphorylation , annexin V-and PI-positive cells were excluded by cell sorting before cell lysis . MLC2 phosphorylation was strongly inhibited by the Y-27632 inhibitor throughout the differentiation process Figure 7b . Similar results were obtained after selective inhibition of ROCK-1 Figure 7c showing that ROCK-1 is the main MLC2-regulating kinase in erythroid cells . To determine whether MLC2 activation is Rho-independent in the late stage of differentiation , MLC2 phosphorylation was assessed at day 10 of the CD36 culture in which Rho activity was inhi-bited . For this purpose , the level of MLC2 phosphorylation was determined after annexin V-and PI-positive cell exclusion by cell sorting following a 24-h treatment with 5 mg ml and 10 mg ml of a cell penetrating form of the Clostridium Botulinum toxin C3 , which induced a dose-dependent inhibition of Rho GTPase activity data not shown . As expected in our culture system in which some immature cells , which are Rho dependent , are still present at the end of the culture , a weak inhibition of MLC2 phosphory-lation was observed with C3 transferase treatment , but this inhibition was weak compared with Y-27632 treatment as shown by analysis of the p-MLC2 HSC70 ratio Figure 7d . Therefore , we could conclude that MLC2 phosphorylation occurs independently of Rho via caspase-activated ROCK-1 . Discussion Terminal erythroid differentiation is characterized by a sequence of morphological changes that require transient caspase activation . These events are followed by nuclei extrusion , which involves a profound reorganization of the cytoskeleton . We demonstrate here that the Rho effector protein ROCK-1 is required for terminal maturation occurring after the onset of caspase activation . At this stage , we show that Rho is not required , which is in agreement with reduced Rho expression at the end of differentiation . Late erythro-poiesis can be characterized in successive stages with respect of cytokine dependency . First , early CFU-E express both c-KIT and EPO-R , the ligands of which are required for survival and proliferation . Then , basophilic erythroblasts downregulate c-KIT , after which caspases are transiently activated , inducing cleavage of selected substrates . c-KIT expression , which is critical for activation of the Rho ROCK pathway , is lost at the end of erythroid differentiation , but this could be overcome by caspase-3-induced ROCK-1 cleavage . This phenomenon allows terminal maturation of erythroblasts independently of SCF signaling . This is confirmed by our results showing that a constitutively truncated construct of ROCK-1 expressed before the onset of caspase activation accelerated terminal maturation . This truncated form exhibits a higher intrinsic kinase activity24,25 that could be required for terminal maturation . However , terminal differentiation , which is inhibited in the presence of a caspase inhibitor , 4 could not be rescued by expressing the constitutively cleaved form of ROCK-1 data not shown suggesting that other caspase targets are involved in terminal maturation . Rock-1 newborn mice exhibit developmental defects in the eyelid and the ventral body wall closure.27 No obvious anemia was described nevertheless , erythroblast develop-ment has not been investigated in these mice28 and compensatory changes in other kinases including MLCK , a caspase-3 target during apoptosis , 29 can not be excluded . ROCK-1 could be involved in erythroid terminal maturation at least in part through contractility control by regulating MLC2 phosphorylation . In the erythroblast , myosin II could function in an actomyosin contractile apparatus responsible for maintaining a normal cell shape during cell condensation . Rho ROCK-1 pathway has been shown to be involved in other differentiation systems , including proplatelet formation through MLC2 phosphorylation , 30 and keratinocyte differen-tiation through stratification and enlargement of cell size.31 Recent findings also define a cytoskeleton-independent function for ROCK in regulating morphogenesis and cell size through insulin IGF signaling.32 Interestingly , ROCK activity was also shown to be a component of the switch in the adipogenesis myogenesis fate.33,34 Thus , we can not exclude that in addition to its role in mediating MLC2 phosphorylation , ROCK-1 may have another function required for terminal erythroid differentiation . Our data provide another evidence that ROCK is a critical mediator of cell differentiation . Recent analyses have provided substantial evidence that apoptotic caspases have important functions in the differ-entiation of various cell types . Keratinocyte cornification involves caspase-14-mediated cleavage of profilaggrin , 35,36 and lens fiber epithelial cells are characterized by complete removal of the nucleus.37 Another type of anucleate cell , platelets , is produced by megakaryocytes in which selected substrates are cleaved by compartmentalized activation of caspase-3.38 Moreover , myoblast to myotube differentiation , which involves caspase-3-mediated cleavage of the kinase MST1 , shares other features with apoptosis such as disassembly and reorganization of the actin fiber.39 Never-theless , little is known concerning the identity of caspases substrates involved in differentiation and the exact require-ment for caspase activity in these systems . We show here that caspase-3 activation in basophilic erythroblasts , cells in which c-KIT receptor expression is lost , allows constitutive activation of ROCK-1 , one of their substrates . We could therefore propose a model in which ROCK is Rho-dependent until the basophilic stage , whereas in the later steps of differentiation , when Rho is no longer activated by SCF signaling , caspase-3-activated ROCK-1 allows terminal maturation . Further exploration of caspase targets in the future will shed light on the mechanism of erythroid differentiation as well as on other systems in which caspases are activated for cell differentiation Materials and Methods Reagents and antibodies .

In vitro generation of erythroid cells . Umbilical cord blood units from normal full-term deliveries were obtained after informed consent of the mothers from the Obstetrics Unit of Hopital � Necker-Enfants Malades . Erythroid cells were generated with a two-step amplification culture system as previously described4 with the following modification because 20�35 % of the cells were GPA ? after the first step of CD34 ? expansion , to better synchronize the culture , we isolated CD36 ? GPA progenitors at the end of the first step . For this purpose , cells were stained with anti-CD36-APC mAb BD Pharmingen , San Diego , CA , USA and anti-glycophorin A-phycoerythrin PE mAb BD Pharmingen and the CD36 ? GPA fraction was purified by cell sorting Facs ARIA Becton Dickinson , Franklin Lakes , NJ , USA day 0 . These cells were subsequently cultured for 10�12 additional days in the presence of IL-3 , SCF and EPO . To investigate the role of ROCK during terminal differentiation , the ROCK inhibitor Y-27632 was added at a concentration of 10 mM in the second step of the culture and the cells were diluted every day with fresh medium without or with Y-27632 . Cell proliferation , differentiation and apoptosis assay . Cell proliferation was assessed by counting cells every day after Trypan blue dye exclusion staining . Apoptosis was assessed by annexin V binding and PI or 7AAD staining . Differentiation was assessed by morphological analysis after May�GrunwaldЬ Giemsa coloration .

21083635	night and early morning Fujii et al. 2007 . Such mat-ing rhythm is called close-proximity CP rhythm . Assays of CP have shown that circadian clocks regu-late male courtship behavior in a circadian manner . Furthermore , they showed that the core component of circadian clock , per , is regulated for the generation of CP rhythms . However , the circadian clock neu-rons driving rhythms in CP behavior have not been identified . In this study , we aimed at identifying the clock neurons that control CP rhythms in D. melanogaster . Although the dynamics of the CP rhythms are dis-tinct from the locomotor activity of single fly Fujii et al. 2007 , we assumed that either or both M cells and E cells are involved in CP behavior . Thus , we combined M-cell-and ? or E-cell-specific GAL4 ? GAL80 lines with UAS-hid , a programmed cell death gene , to determine whether M cells and ? or E cells contribute to CP rhythms . We found that E cells are involved in the CP rhythms . Immunocytochemical studies showed that a small population of E cells , in particular , is crucial for the normal CP rhythms . Results For sexually reproducing animals , a complex sequence of mating behavior is required to propagate healthy offspring . Based on this notion , sexual behavior including the courtship behavior of D. melanogaster has been studied as an obvious candidate for involvement in the temporal separation of subpopulations during the speciation process Sakai Ishida 2001 Miyatake et al. 2002 Tauber et al. 2003 Rogers et al. 2004 Nishinokubi et al. 2006 . If so between Drosophila species , the dynamics of the CP rhythm might be conserved among the wild-type strains of D. melanog-aster . To extend our knowledge about the timing of the courtship behavior in D. melanogaster , we applied CP assay to three wild-type strains of D. melanogaster , OGS-4 , 1619 and Canton-S strains . We monitored CP in wild-type D. melanogaster Oregon-R under DD , subsequent to a light and dark LD12 12 cycle . The CP rhythms of heterosexual pairs of Oregon-R flies dipped at dusk under LD12 12 . The rhythmic profile of CP persisted under DD with dip at the time of subjective lights-off CT12 Fig. 1A . The circadian rhythmicity of CP under DD was statisti-cally significant according to autocorrelation analysis 24.0 � 0.75 h . The other wild types also showed a close-proximity rhythm similar to that in Oregon-R , although the strength of rhythmicity in all three strains was not as distinct as that of Oregon-R . This observa-tion supports the notion that the dynamics of the CP Role of E cells for CP rhythm in Drosophila brain cry-GAL4 line is specific to the LNvs , LNds and some DN1s Stoleru et al. 2004 . First , we used the pairs of the cry-GAL4 ? UAS-hid flies referred as cry hid below to see whether these subgroups of clocks are involved in the CP rhythm . The initial controls were fly pairs with only the UAS-hid transgene +hid . The CP rhythms in +hid pairs under both LD12 12 and DD were robust and similar to those of Oregon-R pairs Fig. 2A . We then ablated only M cells in the pairs of pdf-GAL4 ? UAS-hid flies Fig. 2B because M cells predominate over E cells with respect to activity rhythms under DD Renn et al. 1999 . The clear circadian CP rhythm suggested that M cells are not crucial for the CP rhythms . Dippes in CP behavior at subjective dusk in pdf-GAL4 ? UAS-hid flies were slightly impaired under DD , suggesting that M cells control the amplitude of CP rhythms or synchroniza-tion of CP rhythms between each pairs . However , CP was low in the pairs of cry-GAL4 ? UAS-hid referred to as cry hid below flies in which M cells and E cells were ablated . The frequency of CP was consis-tently low under both LD and DD , CP behavior under light was attenuated , and the dippes at dusk were not prominent under either LD or DD Fig. 2C . These results suggested that E cells are more important for CP behavior . However , autocorrelation analysis detected circadian rhythmicity in the CP behavior of cry-GAL4 ? UAS-hid flies under DD . Indeed a slight increase in CP behavior was at dawn , suggesting that the residual rhythm in CP behavior is controlled by clock neurons other than the M cells and E cells . To clarify whether E cells are important for CP rhythms , we examined CP behavior in cry-GAL4 ? pdf-GAL80 ? UAS-hid flies [ cry -pdf hid ] in which M cells escaped targeted cell death ablated E cells with intact M cells Stoleru et al. 2004 . CP behavior in the cry -pdf hid pairs was totally arrhythmic under both LD and DD . These results suggest that E cells are responsible for distinct CP rhythms , whereas M cells are rather supportive . To further understand the molecular clock func-tion of M cells and E cells in generating CP rhythms , we rendered the circadian function of these neurons defective by expressing a dominant-negative type of positive transcription factor , CYCD Tanoue et al. 2004 . When CYCD expression was limited in M cells by pdf-GAL4 pdf CYCD , CP behavior B C D remained rhythmic , but the dippes of CP behavior were impaired similar to pdf hid flies Fig. 3A , B . CYCD expression in M cells and E cells by cry-GAL4 cry CYCD decreased CP behavior . Although dip-pes of CP behavior are slightly remained at dusk , the CP rhythms were weak Fig. 3C . When CYCD expression was limited in E cells by cry-GAL4 ? pdf-GAL80 cry -pdf CYCD , the CP rhythms were severely impaired , like as the flies that E cells were ablated . It should note that the CP rhythms slightly A B C D E dipped at dawn in cry -pdf CYCD , which were detected as a component with 12-h period by auto-correlation analysis Fig. 3D . CYCD was expressed in all clock neurons by tim-GAL4 , and CP behavior was completely arrhythmic Fig. 3E . In all genotypes , CYCD expression resulted in rather weak phenotype compared to hid expression . Identification of clock neurons involved in CP rhythm generation An immunocytochemical approach with anti-PDF and anti-CLK antisera confirmed M-and E-cell abla-tion Houl et al. 2006 . All neurons in pdf hid flies were PDF immunonegative , whereas other clock neurons , such as LNds , PDF-negative s-LNv 5th-s-LNv and DNs remained intact Fig. 4B . None of the LNs in cry hid flies were detected using anti-CLK antiserum . In addition to these neurons , five dorsal neurons DN1 were ablated in cry hid flies Fig. 4C , and as in these flies , LNds , 5th-s-LNv and five DN1 cells were ablated in the cry -pdf hid flies . Although both l-LNvs and s-LNvs should have been rescued in the cry -pdf hid flies , only s-LNvs were detectable Fig. 4D . These observations suggest that at least LNds , PDF-negative s-LNv and five DN1s involve cells for generating the normal CP rhythm . Our immunocytochemical observation was essentially similar to the GFP expression studies reported by Stoleru et al. 2004 , but the number of DN1 in the cry hid flies was different . Also we could see that l-LNv cells are not rescued in the cry -pdf hid flies , which is unexpected from GFP expression studies Stoleru et al. 2004 . An explana-tion for the discrepancy between GFP expression and targeted cell death might be that some GFP-positive neurons are involved in the development of other clock neurons . Differences on the CP rhythm pheno-type between hid expression and CYCD would in part arise from these mistargeted cell death . Neuropeptide-F , homologous to mammalian neuro-peptide-Y , is expressed in the brain neurons including three LNd cells Lee et al. 2006 . To test whether these three npf-positive LNds are involved in the CP rhythm , we measured CP rhythms in npf-GAL4 ? UAS-hid flies npf hid . Interestingly , CP rhythms in the npf hid did not differ from those of control flies with only the npf-GAL4 transgene npf+ Fig. 5A , B . Furthermore , we measured CP rhythms among pairs of flies in which UAS-hid was changed into UAS-CYCD npf CYCD . The CP rhythms of the A B C D npf CYCD pairs were similar to those of the control Fig. 5C . We assayed the efficiency of npf hid-induced ablation by immunocytochemistry using anti-CLK and anti-PDF antisera . Three of six LNds were ablated in the npf hid flies as predicted from other studies , although ablation of 5th-s-LNvs was not obvious Fig. 5D . However , other clock neurons , including DN1s , remained intact in the npf hid pairs . This suggests that the three npf-positive LNds at least are not required for the CP rhythms . Although ablation of npf-positive cells alters the latency of courtship behavior Lee et al. 2006 , CP rhythm was not under the control of npf-positive clocks . E Discussion The neuronal processing that coordinates sensory inputs with the appropriate motor output responses is one of the most challenging aspects within the fields of studying courtship as well as circadian be-havior Helfrich-Forster � 2003 Billeter et al. 2006 . Recent studies have characterized the major clock neurons in the brain of Drosophila as M cells and E cells that regulate locomotor activities at dawn and at dusk , respectively , under LD conditions . M cells predominate over E cells with respect to the locomo-tor rhythms in DD Renn et al. 1999 . The present study showed that E cells three npf-negative LNds , five DN1s and possibly 5th-s-LNv and M cells include cells essential for the CP rhythm . Both E cells and M cells are involved in the CP rhythms , but these cells contribute to the CP rhythm differently . When E cells were abrated , the CP rhythms were impaired under LD as well as under DD , suggesting that E cells are essential for output of the CP rhythms . However , when M cells sLNvs and lLNvs were absent or dysfunctional , the CP rhythms sustained under LD and were gently dampening under DD , suggesting that M cells help E cells with maintaining the rhythms and ? or synchronizing the phase under DD . Signaling from LNvs to E cells is possibly mediated by neuropeptide PDF which are necessary for the maintenance of robust rhythms in some DN1s , CRY-positive LNds and DN2s Renn et al. 1999 Yoshii et al. 2009 . Taken together , we propose a model that E cells three npf-negative LNds , five DN1s and possibly 5th-s-LNv include cells essential for the generation of the CP rhythms , whereas M cells possibly lLNvs support the amplitude of clock oscillation of E cells . In cry -pdf hid flies , puzzlingly , sLNvs eliminated the residual CP rhythms that were shown in cry hid flies . This might be explained the fact that some of the cry-GAL4-negative DNs oscillate with antiphase in the presence of PDF or dampen the clock oscilla-tion in the absence of PDF Yoshii et al. 2009 . While we were preparing this manuscript , a simi-lar report was published by Fujii Amrein 2010 . Their findings are largely along with our observa-tions that some DN1s and in particular LNvs are essential for the CP rhythms . Considering their observations , the present study suggests the possibil-ity that M cells could affect the CP rhythms by way of E cells . However , the CP rhythms sustained without LNvs at least for a couple of days under DD , suggesting that E cells as the primary determi-nant of rhythmic motivation for Drosophila courtship behavior . Interestingly , some E cells , which is 2 npf-positive LNds , a NPF-negative LNds and 5th-s-LNv , are sufficient to drive the locomotor rhythms without LNvs under a certain light condition Rie-ger et al. 2009 . Rieger et al. 2009 propose a notion that M cells and E cells act differently depending on the environmental conditions . Simi-larly , we assume that these E cells could also change behavior pattern from single locomotor rhythms to courtship rhythms in case of social situations change from single to pair . A complex sequence of mating behavior is required to propagate healthy offspring among sexu-ally reproductive animals . Based on this notion , sex-ual behavior in Drosophila has been investigated as an obvious candidate for involvement in the tempo-ral separation of subpopulations during the speciation process Sakai Ishida 2001 Tauber et al. 2003 . If this is true for Drosophila species , the rhythmic nat-ure of CP behavior might be conserved among wild-type strains of D. melanogaster . Thus , we applied CP assays to D. melanogaster wild-type strains , OGS-4 , # 1619 and Canton-S . Although the strength of the rhythmicity in these strains was not as distinct as that in Oregon-R , the dynamics of CP rhythms in all of the wild types were similar Fig. 1 , suggesting that the timing of CP behavior is intrinsic in D. melanogaster . Notably , male-dependent CP rhythms resemble female-dependent sexual receptivity rhythms in the circadian phase Sakai Ishida 2001 Fujii et al. 2007 . The inclination of D. melanogaster to mate at a specific time of day supports the notion that the species-specific timing of reproductive behavior causes reproductive isolation with subse-quent Drosophila speciation Sakai Ishida 2001 Tauber et al. 2003 Rogers et al. 2004 Nishinokubi et al. 2006 . M cells and E cells regulate activity bouts at dawn and dusk . In addition , these cells couple to adapt behavior to seasonal environmental changes M cells dominate during short days and E cells dominate dur-ing long days Stoleru et al. 2007 . The dual-oscillator model of entrainment described by Pittendrigh Daan 1976 suggests that E cells are dominant during summer days . Our findings suggested that E cells rather than M cells play a predominant role in CP rhythms . The predominant role of E cells on CP rhythms implies that summer days are suitable for reproduction in D. melanogaster . Furthermore , the two-oscillator model explains adaptation to seasonal changes in day length even in mammals and suggests that such clock networks in the brain are common between Drosophila and mammals Rieger et al. 2006 Stoleru et al. 2007 Mendoza et al. 2009 . Experimental procedures Fly strains We used the wild-type strains , Oregon-R , Canton-S , OGS-4 and # 1619 . The following stock lines provided by M. Rosbash were used for targeted neuronal ablation yw , UAS-hid ? CyO + , yw pdf-GAL4 + , yw pdf-GAL80 ? CyO + , and yw + cry - GAL4-13 ? TM6b . Because our video camera was not able to capture flies with yw phenotypes under dim red lights , the first chromosome of all transgenic lines was displaced with the wild-type , Canton-S . The yw + npf-GAL4 strain was pro-vided by P. Shen . All flies were raised under a 12-h light ? 12-h dark cycle at 25 �C . Close-proximity assay Virgin males and females were separated within 6 h of eclo-sion . Approximately 20 flies were maintained in a vial for 6� 9 days . One male and female each of the same genotype were lightly anesthetized with CO2 and rapidly placed in a 35-mm-diameter dish with standard fly food . A recording system was established as described Fujii et al. 2007 . Briefly , dishes con-taining flies were mounted under a CCD camera Watec Co. Ltd. , Yamagata , Japan , which is sensitive to light close to the infrared range . A fluorescent light was used for illumination 100 lux and a red LED for constant dim light 1 lux . Time-lapse images 1 frame per 10 s were sent to a personal computer . The locations of the flies were counted on the X-and Y-axis of the image using an ImageJ Plugin http rsb.in-fo.nih.gov ij . The CP index of each pair was calculated from the X-Y value with a threshold 5 mm between pairs of flies . All CP assays were performed with flies of the same genotypes . Statistical analysis All CP data were averaged for each genotype . The circadian rhythmicity of the CP was determined using autocorrelation analysis Levine et al. 2002 . The free-running period and the power of rhythmicity in each genotype were calculated as the average of the free-running period and the maximum correla-tion value of each pair that were evaluated as rhythmic by the autocorrelation analysis . The period and number of rhythmic pairs were statistically analyzed using a two-tailed t-test , and the numbers of immunolabeled cells were analyzed using the Mann�Whitney U-test . Immunocytochemistry As the anti-CLK antiserum intensely labels clock cells at any time of the day Houl et al. 2006 , all clock neurons could be identified independently of the phase of circadian protein expression oscillation . Anti-PDF serum was used to identify PDF-negative 5th-s-LNv from PDF-positive LNvs . The immunocytochemical protocol basically followed the described procedure Houl et al. 2006 . In short , the central nervous sys-tem of the adult flies was fixed with PEM-FA fixative . The tissues were extensively washed in phosphate-buffered saline containing Triton-X and then incubated overnight at 4 �C with a mixture of primary anti-CLK and anti-PDF antisera that were detected using Cy3-conjugated goat anti-guinea pig antiserum and FITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antiserum , respectively . Specimens were inspected under a Zeiss Axioplan 2 microscope and a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope Zeiss , Jena , Germany . Images were obtained using a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope . Stacks of confocal images were projected into an image using a Zeiss LSM image browser . Acknowledgements We thank P. Shen University of Georgia , Athens , GA , USA , T.

Figure 1 Close-proximity CP rhythms of various wild-type Drosophila melanogaster strains . Proximity index shows obvious circadian rhythms in various wild-type strains . Flies were paired at dusk during LD12 12 cycle . Data were obtained under constant darkness DD after 1 day under LD12 12 . A Pairs of Oregon-R flies exhibited daily CP behavior under LD12 12 . Rhythmic CP behavior persisted under DD n 10 . Although such rhythms were not as distinct as those of Oregon-R , CP rhythms were similar in Canton-S B n 10 , # 1619 C n 6 and OGS-4 D n 13 . All CP rhythms were statistically tested by autocorrelation analysis right panels of each , resulting in significant circadian rhyth-micity 95 % significant level indicated by dotted line . White area on the graph indicates day black and gray bars indicate subjective night and subjective day , respectively . Data from 6 to 13 pairs are averaged for each panel . Error bars denote SEM .

Introduction Ischemic pre-conditioning IPC by brief ischemia induced robust tolerance to ischemia in rat retina . Roth et al. , 1998 Among the mechanisms of ischemic tolerance in the retina are altered expression of a variety of genes Kamphuis et al. , 2007 , decreased apoptosis Zhang et al. , 2002 , and involvement of adenosine Isenmann et al. , 1999 , HIF-1a Zhu et al. , 2007 , erythropoietin Dreixler et al. , 2009b , and protein kinases including Akt , PKC , and p38 . Dreixler et al. , 2008 , 2009a , 2009c Activated mitogen-activated protein kinases MAPKs are involved in ischemic injury , and we recently reported that MAPK p38a is an essential component for IPC in the retina . Dreixler et al. , 2009a Roth et al. , 2003 The MAPK family of proteins consists of three main classes of kinases with extensive cross-talk between them extracellular-regulated kinase ERK , p38 MAPK , and c-jun N-terminal kinase JNK . The ERK pathway is mainly activated by growth factors , promoting cell growth , differentiation , and proliferation . JNK and p38 MAPKs are stress-activated kinases critically involved in cell survival . Chang and Karin , 2001 p38 MAPK is generally thought to mediate stress-induced apoptosis in the central nervous system . Fu , 1999 Tian et al. , 2000 Dual-specificity phosphatases DUSPs dephosphorylate and inactivate MAPKs by acting simultaneously upon phosphorylated threonine and tyrosine residues . The best characterized is MKP-1 mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase-1 , DUSP1 , a nuclear phosphatase with a specificity about equal for p38 and JNK , followed by ERK , although with the three-dimensional structure of MKP-1 still not known , specificity in vivo has not been well characterized . Patterson et al. , 2009 A variety of factors regulate MKP-1 mRNA levels , including heat shock , hypoxia , arachidonic acid , and other stress conditions , as well as MAPK activity . Boutros et al. , 2008 For example , MKP-1isinduced by MAPKactivatorsand stimulated by the p38 MAPK target ATF2 . Breitwieser et al. , 2007 Inhibition of p38 MAPK significantly reduces MKP-1 expression . Hu et al. , 2007 Many studies have shown MKP-1 to be an essential negative regulator of the p38 MAPK pathway . Wu and Bennett , 2005 Grethe and Porn-Ares , 2006 Breitwieser et al. , 2007 Kondoh and Nishida , 2007 In addition to potentially regulating p38 in ischemic pre-conditioning , there is other evidence to suggest a role for MKP-1 in IPC . Microarray , Northern , and Western blot analyses confirmed that MKP-1 mRNA and protein levels were up-regulated approxi-mately 8-fold by hypoxia in a pheochromocytoma cell line . Cobalt and deferoxamine also increased MKP-1 , suggesting that hypoxia-inducible factor HIF-1a may play a role in the regulation of MKP-1 by hypoxia . Seta et al. , 2001 In hypoxic tumor cells , MKP-1 was identified as a hypoxia-responsive gene . Laderoute et al. , 1999 HIF-1a has been identified as a mediator of ischemic pre-condi-tioning in the retina . Zhu et al. , 2007 In this study we hypothe-sized , based upon our previous investigation of MAPKs in retinal ischemia and ischemic pre-conditioning , that MKP-1 is an essential component in the signaling events in ischemic pre-conditioning that trigger ischemic tolerance . We also examined the relationship between IPC , MKP-1 , and p38 in the retina in vivo . 2 . Materials and methods 2.1 . Retinal ischemia and pre-conditioning Wistar rats 200e250 gm purchased from Harlan Indianapolis , IN were maintained on a 12 h on 12 h off light cycle . Procedures Roth et al. , 2006 Dreixler et al. , 2008 conformed to the ARVO Resolution on the Use of Animals in Research and were approved by our Animal Care Committee . IPC was produced in rats anesthetized with ketamine 35 mg kg , and xylazine 5 mg kg i.p . Corneal analgesia was with 1e2 drops of 0.5 % proparacaine Alcon . Pupils were dilated with 0.5 % tropicamide Alcon , and cyclomydril 0.2 % cyclopentolate HCl and 1 % phenylephrine HCl Alcon . A 3-0 sterile silk suture was passed beyond the eye and pulled through PE-100 tubing to maximal tightness for 5 min while observing the retina under the operating microscope for the absence of perfusion . Dreixler et al. , 2008 , 2009c IPC was performed 24 h prior to ischemia . For retinal ischemia , rats were anesthetized with chloral hydrate , 275 mg kg i.p. , and intraocular pressure IOP increased after achieving corneal analgesia to 130e135 mm Hg for 55 min using a pressurized bag of sterile ocular irrigating solution BSS Alcon , Fort Worth , TX connected to a 30 g needle positioned in the center of the anterior chamber . The IOP was measured continuously using the needle and pressure tubing via a 3-way stopcock inter-posed into the line , using an electronic pressure transducer HewlettePackard zeroed to the level of the eye . IOP exceeded the systolic blood pressure , monitored non-invasively using tail blood pressure cuff IITC Life Science Woodland Hills , CA . Body temperature was maintained at 36e37 C by a servo-controlled heating blanket Harvard Apparatus , Natick , MA to prevent a protective effect on ischemia of hypothermia . Faberowski et al. , 1989 To preclude ischemic tolerance due to hypoxia Zhu et al. , 2007 , hemoglobin O2 saturation was measured with a pulse oximeter Ohmeda Louisville , CO on the rat�s tail . Supplemental oxygen , when necessary to maintain O2 saturation 94 % , was administered using a cannula placed in front of the nares and mouth . 2.2 . Electroretinography before and after retina ischemia Procedures were similar to those we reported previously Roth et al. , 2003 , 2006 Dreixler et al. , 2008 . Animals were dark-adapted for at least 2 h before recordings . For baseline and post-ischemic i.e. , after 7 days follow-up ERG , and during pre-conditioning , rats were injected i.p. with ketamine 35 mg kg , and xylazine 5 mg kg . Corneal analgesia was with 1e2 drops of 0.5 % proparacaine Alcon . Pupils were dilated with 0.5 % tropicamide Alcon , and cyclomydril 0.2 % cyclopentolate HCl and 1 % phenyl-ephrine HCl Alcon . The ERG was recorded at baseline prior to experiments and 7 days after ischemia by placing platinum needle electroencephalo-gram electrodes Grass , Providence , RI in contact with the corneal surfaces of both eyes and a reference electrode on the tongue , as we reported previously . Dreixler et al. , 2008 , 2009a , 2009b , 2009c Stimulus-intensity ERG analysis was achieved on a UTAS-E4000 using a full-field Ganzfeld stimulator LKC Technologies , Gaithers-burg , MD , with the rat�s head centered 7 inches from the stimulator . The low pass filter was 0.05 Hz and the high pass 500 Hz . Flash intensity variedelectronically from 3.39 log cd s m2 to 1.89 log cd s m2 Settings were confirmed by photometry EG G Model 550 photometer , Electro-Optics , Boulder , CO . Responses were averaged for 3 to 10 flashes delivered 4e60 s apart depending upon flash intensity , with number of flashes decreasing and time between them increasing with flash intensity . Flashes were progressively delivered from the lowest intensity to the highest to prevent possible effect upon dark adaptation , and at least 1 min elapsed between the series of flashes for the three highest intensity settings . Recorded time , intensity , and amplitude were exported and analyzed in Matlab Math Works , Natick , MA . Recordings were first baseline-corrected for drift and low frequency noise . Peak a-wave amplitude was calculated as the negative minimum following the light stimulus , and the b-wave amplitude as difference between the a-wave and the maximum value recorded thereafter . Oscillatory potentials OPs were measured by extracting OP wavelet compo-nents using Fast Fourier transformation . The sum of the root mean squares Sum RMS of the amplitudes of the OP wavelets was calculated . Scotopic P2 for the rod bipolar response was calculated using the Lamb and Pugh model . Bui et al. , 2005 . 2.3 . Histology Eyes enucleated on the seventh day after ischemia were immediately placed in Davidson�s fixative 11 % glacial acetic acid , 2 % neutral buffered formalin and 32 % ethanol in H2O for 24 h , then transferred to 70 % ethanol for 24 h and stored in phosphate-buffered saline at 4 C. Eyes were embedded in paraffin , sectioned to 4 mm and stained with hematoxylin and eosin H E . Sections were examined by light microscopy and retinal ganglion cell RGC layer counts quantitated as described earlier Roth et al. , 1998 Junk et al. , 2002 Dreixler et al. , 2009b . For determination of cell counts in the inner and outer nuclear layers INL and ONL , images of retinal sections were captured using Micron Westover Scientific , Mill Creek , WA . Several cell regions of interest ROI were selected around 1500 mm from the optic nerve bundle and the numbers of cells were manually counted and corrected for the calculated area of the ROI . These results are expressed as the number of cells per unit area mm2 100 . 2.4 . RNA interference Target interfering RNA siRNA sequences for MKP-1 siRNA , Qiagen , Valencia , CA were CCC GTT CGG GAC CAA TAT ATT , AAC GAG GCG ATT GAC TTT ATA , CAC GAA CAG TGC CCT GAA CTA , and CTG CTG CAA TTT GAG TCC CAA . The siRNAs were designed using neural-network technology as described previously Huesken et al. , 2005 . Using BLAST , we found the siRNAs were 100 % homologous to the mRNA sequence of MKP-1 . siRNA design was then checked for homology to all other sequences of the genome , 30 UTR seed analysis , single nucleotide polymorphisms , and interferon motif avoidance Farh et al. , 2005 Hornung et al. , 2005 Judge et al. , 2005 http www1.qiagen.com Products GeneSilencing HPOnGuardsiRN ADesign.aspx . Sequences of the introduced siRNA are uniquely specific to the targeted gene see reviews for more details Dorsett and Tuschl , 2004 Genc et al. , 2004 Lehner et al. , 2004 Mello and Conte , 2004 . A 2 ml mixture of four siRNAs to MKP-1 , or a single negative control , non-silencing siRNA not corresponding to any known rat gene Qiagen in RPMI media Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA , and RNAiFect transfection reagent Qiagen at a final concentration of 3 mM was injected into the mid-vitreous of both eyes of the rats with a microsyringe Hamilton , Reno , NV as previously described Roth et al. , 2006 . 2.5 . Cell culture and immunocytochemistry PC-12eT cells were used to test knockdown of MKP-1 protein by siRNA . The cell line was cultured in RPMI-1640 media supplemented with 10 % heat-inactivated horse serum , 5 % fetal bovine serum , Glutamax , penicillin , and streptomycin Invitrogen in a humidified 10 % CO2 incubator at 37 C. Cells were differentiated for 48 h with the same culture medium , including nerve growth factor NGF 100 ng ml Invitrogen . The cells were exposed to 400 nM siRNA in RPMI media with RNAiFect transfection reagent Qiagen for 24 h . Expression of the targeted proteins was then examined using immunocytochemical techniques . Cultured PC12-T cells plated on collagen-coated glass coverslips were fixed on ice with 4 % para-formaldehyde 4 % sucrose solution for 15 min . Cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and stored at 4 C in PBS with 10 mM sodium azide until immunostaining . For staining , cells were incubated in primary antibody , rabbit polyclonal anti-MKP-1 sc-1199 , Santa Cruz Biotechnology Santa Cruz , CA 1 50 in PBS with 5 % dry milk overnight at 4 C. Cells were then exposed to goat anti-rabbit IgG rhodamine-conjugate secondary antibody . 1 500 Jackson Immu-noResearch , West Grove , PA . Antifade mounting media with DAPI EMC Biosciences , La Jolla , CA was applied and coverslips were sealed with nail polish and stored at 4 C . The antibody processing was standardized by utilizing standard antibody concentrations and antibody exposure times , of both the primary and secondary antibodies , in order to allow for the quantification of fluorescent intensities . Dreixler et al. , 2008 , , 2009c 2.6 . Immunohistochemistry To examine cellular localization of MKP-1 , eyes were removed from euthanized rats and evaluated using immunohistochemistry as previously described Junk et al. , 2002 Roth et al. , 2006 . Enucleated eyes were fixed at room temperature in 4 % paraformaldehyde for 3 h . After removal of the anterior segment , the posterior portion of the eye was post-fixed in the same fixative overnight at 4 C before being placed in 25 % sucrose for a second overnight period at 4 C for cryoprotection . Eyecups were embedded in OCT compound Sakura Finetec , Torrance , CA and were cut into 10 mm thick cryosections . Primary antibodies 1 50 concentration included rabbit poly-clonal anti-MKP-1 Santa Cruz Biotechnology , mouse monoclonal 2.7 . Imaging and image analysis For imaging of the PC12-T cells and the immunostained sections , we utilized a fluorescence microscope Olympus IX81 inverted microscope , a Fast firewire Retiga EXichilled CCD camera , anda 40 oil lens . Excitation dichroic emission settings were 480 40 nm-505LP-535 30 nm for rhodamine and 530e550 nme570DM-590LP for greens FITC and fluorescein . Quantification of the immunocy-tochemical fluorescent intensities was performed using NIH ImageJ v.1.33 , adapted from our previous methods Roth et al. , 2003 . The mean intensity was determined for all single isolated cells in four random fields . 2.8 . Western blotting Procedures were those we used in previous studies Junk et al. , 2002 Zhang et al. , 2002 . Retinas were rapidly dissected and frozen in liquid N2 , and then crushed with a tissue pulverizer Beckman , Fullerton , CA on dry ice . Retinas were solubilized in Milliplex MAP lysis buffer Millipore , Billerica , MA . Protease inhibitor cocktail P8340 Sigma consisting of 4-2-aminoethyl benzenesulfonyl fluoride , pepstatin A , bestatin , leupeptin , E 64 , and aprotinin was added to prevent protease activity . Samples were centrifuged at 10,000g for 10 min . The supernatant was used for SDS-PAGE and the pellet was discarded . Protein concentration was determined using a modified Bradford assay Bio-Rad , Hercules , CA . Equal amounts of retinal protein per lane 40 mg were diluted with SDS sample buffer and loaded onto gels for SDS-PAGE 4 % e20 % or 16 % Invitrogen . Proteins were electroblotted to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes Immobilon-P Millipore , Bedford , MA and the efficiency of transfer confirmed by staining the membrane with Ponceau S red Sigma . Non-specific binding was blocked with 5 % nonfat dry milk in Tween-Tris-buffered saline TTBS . Membranes were incubated at 4 C for varying time periods with primary antibodies Table 1 that were prepared in 5 % nonfat dry milk solution in TTBS . Anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase HRP -conjugated goat IgG Jackson ImmunoResearch or anti-mouse HRP-conjugated sheep IgG Amersham , Buckinghamshire , England secondary antibodies Table 1 Antibodies used for Western blotting . ERK 1 1000 JNK 1 1000 were applied at 1 20,000 . Chemiluminescence was developed with a kit Super Signal West Pico Pierce , Rockford , IL . Protein bands were digitally imaged with a commercial system CCDBIO 16SC Imaging System Hitachi Genetic Systems MiraiBio , Alameda , CA and quantitated by densitometry Gene Snap and Gene Tools software Hitachi . 2.9 . Studies The role of MKP-1 was specifically examined using RNA inter-ference . Specific siRNAs for MKP-1 or a negative control siRNA all at 3 mM concentrations were injected into the vitreous of both eyes 6 h before IPC , followed by 55 min of ischemia in one eye 24 h later . Additional experiments were performed to determine if siRNA affected the outcome after ischemia independent of IPC . For these studies , results in two parallel groups were compared . Negative control siRNA or siRNA to MKP-1 was injected , followed 6 h later by sham IPC suture placed but not tightened , then followed by ischemia 24 h later . To examine impact of MKP-1 inhibition upon MAPKs in pre-conditioning , we collected retinae 24 h after IPC with injection of non-silencing siRNA or siRNA to MKP-1 6 h previously . This time point for sampling was chosen based upon the 24 h separation between IPC and ischemia used for the studies of outcome after ischemia . 2.10 . Data handling and statistical analysis ERG data were corrected for diurnal variation in the normal eye and for simultaneous reference to the baseline in the ischemic eye , as previously described Roth et al. , 2006 Dreixler et al. , 2008 , 2009b , 2009c . The a-and b-waves , Sum RMS of the OPs , and calculated P2 from ischemic eyes 7 d after ischemia in the groups for comparison were expressed as stimulus-intensity plots intensity , log cd s m2 on the x-axis , and % recovery of amplitude on the y-axis . Dreixler et al. , 2008 The data were normally distributed as confirmed using normality plots and skewness kurtosis in Stata version 10.0 College Station , TX . The data were analyzed between matched groups using ANOVA and post-hoc unpaired t tests Stata 10.0 . Data were analyzed similarly for Western blots . For histo-pathological data analysis , we could not assume a normal distri-bution and therefore used the ManneWhitney non-parametric test . 3 . Results 3.1 . MKP-1 cellular localization in the retina To define the cellular localization of MKP-1 in the retina , frozen sections of rat retina were studied using immunohistochemistry . We co-stained with the following antibodies to specific protein markers forco-localization of MKP-1 in retinalcells 1 Thy1 for RGCs Dreixler et al. , 2008 , 2 vimentin for M�ller cells Verardo et al. , 2008 , 3 calretinin for amacrine cells Kielczewski et al. , 2005 , 4 PKCa for bipolar cells Roth et al. , 2003 , and 5 calbindin for hori-zontal cells . Hirano et al. , 2007 Dreixler et al. , 2008 Fig.1 shows co-localization of MKP-1 with cellular markers in RGCs A , bipolar cells B , displaced amacrine cells in the RGC layer C , horizontal cells D , and M�ller cells E . Moreover , co-staining of MKP-1 and DAPI , as seen in A and C , further suggest that MKP-1 is located in cells other than RGCs in the retinal ganglion cell layer such as displaced amacrine cells . Control sections for primary antibodies incubated with non-immune serum demonstrated no staining not shown . 3.2 . In vitro cellular validation of MKP-1 siRNA silencing In PC12-T cells , Fig. 2 treatment for 24 h with MKP-1 siRNA significantly decreased MKP-1 protein levels to 16 2 mean intensity absolute units as compared to a mean intensity of 47 8 for non-silencing siRNA-treated controls p ? 0.01 n ? 6 . 3.3 . Blocking MKP-1 with siRNA and IPC Intravitreal injection of MKP-1 siRNA 6 h prior to IPC n ? 6 , followed by ischemia 24 h later significantly decreased the a-wave , b-wave , and P2 recovery at 7 days after ischemia , but not the OPs when compared to the non-silencing RNA injected n ? 7 control group Figs . 3A , 4A . Histological examination of the retinae 7 d after ischemia showed that the number of cells in the RGC layer in the ischemic retinae significantly decreased from 9.9 0.6 for non-silencing siRNA IPC ? ischemia p ? 0.05 n ? 6 to 8.0 0.5 n ? 6 in the MKP-1 siRNA IPC ? ischemia p ? 0.05 n ? 6 group Table 2A . In the latter , the inner and outer nuclear layers were folded and demonstrated inflammatory cell infiltration Fig. 5 . The RGCs in the control non-ischemic eyes were 10.5 0.6 for non-silencing siRNA IPC ? ischemia and 10.7 0.5 in the MKP-1 siRNA IPC ? ischemia group . The number of cells per unit area mm2 100 for the INL was not significantly changed Table 2B . The number of cells per unit area mm2 100 for the INL in the control non-ischemic eyes was 2.4 0.01 for non-silencing siRNA IPC ? ischemia and 2.1 0.01 in the MKP-1 siRNA IPC ? ischemia Table 2 A B C group . The number of cells area in the ONL for the ischemic retinae significantly decreased from 5.1 0.2 p ? 0.05 n ? 6 for non-silencing siRNA IPC ? ischemia to 4.4 0.2 n ? 6 in MKP-1 siRNA IPC ? ischemia group p 0.05 , Table 2C . The number of cells per unit area mm2 100 for the ONL in the control non-ischemic eyes was 5.4 0.01 for non-silencing siRNA IPC ? ischemia and 4.8 0.01 in the MKP-1 siRNA IPC ? ischemia group . Retinal functional recovery in rats receiving intravitreal injec-tion of MKP-1 siRNA 6 h prior to sham IPC n ? 7 followed 24 h later by ischemia was compared with rats receiving intravitreal injection of non-silencing siRNA 6 h prior to sham IPC n ? 6 , then ischemia 24 h later , to determine whether MKP-1 siRNA caused any effect on ischemia . No significant difference was found between the two groups Fig. 3B , 4B . Histological examination of the retinae 7 d after ischemia in these groups showed that the number of cells in the RGC layer in the ischemic retinae significantly decreased from 8.6 0.3 for non-silencing siRNA sham IPC ? ischemia p ? 0.05 n ? 6 to 6.8 0.8 n ? 7 in the MKP-1 siRNA sham IPC ? ischemia group Table 3A . The RGCs in the control non-ischemic eyes were 13.8 1.2 for non-silencing siRNA sham IPC ? ischemia and 11.8 0.4 in the MKP-1 siRNA sham IPC ? ischemia group . Retinas in both groups showed folding of the inner and outer retinal layers and inflammatory cell Table 3 B C infiltration Fig. 5 . The number of cells per unit area mm2 100 for the INL Table 3B and the ONL Table 3C was not significantly changed . The number of cells per unit area mm2 100 for the INL in the control non-ischemic eyes was 2.6 0.01 for non-silencing siRNA sham IPC ? ischemia and 2.6 0.01 in the MKP-1 siRNA sham IPC ? ischemia group . The number of cells per unit area mm2 100 for the ONL in the control non-ischemic eyes was 5.7 0.03 for non-silencing siRNA sham IPC ? ischemia and 6.0 0.03 in the MKP-1 siRNA sham IPC ? ischemia group . 3.4 . Mechanisms of action of MKP-1 in ischemic pre-conditioning The injection of siRNA to block MKP-1 significantly enhanced the phosphorylation of p38 at 24 h after IPC . However , there was no effect upon phosphorylation of other MAPKs , ERK and JNK Fig. 6 . 4 . Discussion The results suggest that MKP-1 is a necessary component in IPC . Blocking MKP-1 production with interfering RNA specific for MKP-1 attenuated the enhanced recovery of the amplitudes of the a-wave , b-wave , and the calculated P2 after ischemia produced by prior IPC . The derived P2 , which reflects activity in rod bipolar cells , is a more specific indicator of the activity in the inner nuclear layer , and supports the notion that IPC and ischemia exert their primary effects in the inner retina . Green and Kapousta-Bruneau , 1999 Even though our co-localization experiments see Fig. 1 did not show MKP-1 in the photoreceptors , the functional protection by MKP-1 seen for the a-wave and photoreceptors may be due to activation of downstream proteins such as p38 after IPC . Histo-logical results showing decreased cells in the RGC layer in the preconditioned and ischemic MKP-1-treated retinae compared to those treated with non-silencing siRNA support the findings that MKP-1 altered the inner retinal neuroprotective effect of IPC . Blockade of MKP-1 did not alter the functional recovery after ischemia without prior IPC sham IPC , but did decrease the number of surviving cells in the RGC layer after ischemia . This further suggests that MKP-1 is involved in the retina�s endogenous response to ischemia . Using antibodies directed against targets on specific retinal cells , we found that MKP-1 was present in retinal ganglion cells , ama-crine cells in the inner nuclear layer and displaced amacrine cells in the RGC layer , horizontal and bipolar cells , and in M�ller cells . The inner nuclear localization of MKP-1 is congruent with the effects of MKP-1 inhibition on inner retinal function after IPC and ischemia . Moreover , MKP-1 localization in this study resembles that which we previously showed for MAPKs in retina . Roth et al. , 2003 Protein tyrosine phosphatases are a very large family of enzymes that dephosphorylate tyrosine residues . Several of them have recently been shown to be important in retinal physiology and disease including protein tyrosine phosphatase Shp2 , and protein tyrosine phosphatase-1B . Cai et al. , 2010 Rajala et al. , 2010 MAPK phosphatases are a subclass of protein tyrosine phosphatases that dephosphorylate phosphotyrosine and phos-phothreonine on MAPKs . To date , only one study has examined MAPK phosphatase in retina , where the authors found expression of high levels of the MAPK phosphatase DUSP3 in human retina without identifying a physiological role for this protein in the retina . Danciger et al. , 2001 The exact mechanism of MKP-1 activation is not known , but is believed to consist of a double feedback mechanism involving MAP kinases . Thus the MAPK target p38 has been shown to regulate the induction of MKP-1 at the translational level through MK2 or ATF2 . Breitwieser et al. , 2007 Hu et al. , 2007 Activated ERK can also alter MKP-1 activity by phosphorylating it and inhibiting ubiquitination to prevent its degradation . Brondello et al. , 1999 The relationship between MKP-1 , the best characterized of the MAPK phosphatases , MAPKs , and pre-conditioning and ischemia is particularly of interest considering the major role of MAPKs in retinal ischemia and pre-conditioning . Results of inhibition by siRNA suggest that the neuroprotective effect of pre-conditioning is significantly compromised when MKP-1 is blocked . One possible explanation of this finding is a change in activation of p38 . In this study , we found that blockade of MKP-1 prior to IPC increased levels of phosphorylated p38 at 24 h after IPC , consistent with a role for MKP-1 in regulating p38 activation in the retina . The effect appears to be specific , as other MAPKs and potential targets of MKP-1 , ERK and JNK , were not affected . In earlier studies we demonstrated that p38 plays a dual role in pre-conditioning and ischemia . Roth et al. , 2003 Dreixler et al. , 2009a While p38 is required for pre-conditioning , increases in p38 activation after ischemia are associ-ated with ischemic injury . Roth et al. , 2003 Excessive activation of p38 in the face of blockade of MKP-1 may have antagonized the neuroprotective p38 effect in pre-conditioning . Little is known about the role of MKP-1 in ischemia . In this study , blockade of MKP-1 did not significantly alter functional recovery after ischemia without prior IPC . But the decrease in cells in the RGC layer suggests an influence upon post-ischemia outcome . Increased expression of MKP-1 has been shown to prevent peptidoglycan-induced increases in tumor necrosis factor TNF -a and other pro-apoptotic pathways . Shepherd et al. , 2004 Moreover , atrogin-1 , a major atrophy-related E3 ubiquitin ligase , markedly enhanced apoptosis after ischemia in cardiomyocytes via activation of JNK signaling by interacting with and triggering MKP-1 for ubiquitin-mediated degradation . Xie et al. , 2009 These results suggest that increased MKP-1 expression promotes cell survival and is a compo-nent of the retina�s endogenous protective mechanisms . In summary , our data suggest that MKP-1 plays a role in ischemic pre-conditioning , and functions as a modulator of p38 activation . Further studies to determine the mechanisms behind MKP-1 expression in IPC will provide a more complete picture of how neuroprotection is achieved and may lead to advancements in treatments against ischemic neurodegenerative diseases .
