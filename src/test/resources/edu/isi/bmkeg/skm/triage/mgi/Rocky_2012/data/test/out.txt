20596076	EB Babiychuk* , 1 , K Monastyrskaya1 , S Potez1 and A Draeger1 Physical disruption of the plasma membrane is common in cells that operate under conditions of mechanical stress.1,2 The permeability barrier can also be breached by chemical means pathogens gain access to host cells by secreting pore-forming toxins and phospholipases , and the host’s own immune system uses pore-forming proteins to eliminate both pathogens and the pathogen-invaded cells.3–5 Nucleated cells survive the disruption of their plasma membrane by a process of resealing.1,2,6–9 If resealing fails , the intracellular contents are lost . But irreversible damage can occur even before this event if the influx of extracellular Ca2 ? is not restrained.9–11 An abrupt elevation in the intracellular con-centration of Ca2 ? [ Ca2 ? ] i activates intracellular protei-nases and phospholipases , thereby causing generalized damage to the phospholipid bilayer and the cytoskeleton.2,12 It is thus hardly surprising that an elevation in [ Ca2 ? ] i is sensed as an ‘immediate danger’ signal by an injured cell.2,13,14 In injured cells the influx of extracellular Ca2 ? triggers a process of plasma membrane blebbing , which is often considered to be a harbinger of cell death.15–22 Blebs are sprouted by cells whose plasma membrane has become locally detached from the actin cortex.15–19 The detachment and surge of cytoplasm into the newly formed blebs are driven by a contraction of the cortical actomyosin , which generates hydrostatic pressure and thus drives herniations of the plasma membrane.19,23 Consequently , blebbing can be triggered by a variety of Ca2 ? -dependent or Ca2 ? -independent mechan-isms that are known to activate myosin or to induce a rearrangement of cytoskeletal and cortical structures.18,24 Blebbing is manifested in a number of physiological pro-cesses , such as cytokinesis , cell spreading and locomo-tion.15–19 However , it is most commonly associated with cell injury and apoptosis.17,18,20–22 Albeit so , the specific role of blebbing in physiological and pathological processes is still controversial.17,18 In this study , we present a hitherto unknown role of blebbing as a mechanism of resistance to plasmalemmal injury . In this capacity , blebs act as a trap for the damaged membrane segment and its adjoining cytosol , and are sealed off from the cell body by plugs of annexin A1 – a Ca2 ? -and membrane-binding protein.25 Following plasmalemmal injury , the loss of intracellular constituents is thus confined to the area of the blebs . Above all , the sealed-off blebs serve as a sink of potentially damaging Ca2 ? , thereby averting detrimental , Ca2 ? -triggered proteolysis and lipolysis within the cell proper . Results Plasmalemmal injury triggers blebbing . Human embryonic kidney HEK 293 cells responded to permeabilization with streptolysin O SLO – a bacterial pore-forming toxin – by sprouting multiple transient blebs Figure 1a Supplementary Movie 1 . Whereas only 1.8±0.6 % of the cells blebbed before the addition of SLO 440 cells in 16 independent experiments , 36.4±2.4 % of the same cell population blebbed after its application Figure 1b t-test Po0.01 . Contraction of the cortical actomyosin was a driving force in bleb formation Figure 1b only 1.4±0.8 % of the cells that had been pre-treated with blebbistatin – a selective inhibitor of myosin II ATPase26 – responded to SLO permeabilization by blebbing 125 cells in 4 experiments t-test Po0.01 . SLO-induced blebbing was the direct consequence of an injury-induced influx of Ca2 ? . Even after permeabilization , relatively few cells blebbed if [ Ca2 ? ] free in the extracellular milieu was below 100 nM Figure 1c experimental point [ Ca2 ? ] free ? 0 . When [ Ca2 ? ] free was increased to 1 mM , the percentage of blebbing cells increased significantly , attaining 0 20 40 60 a maximum at 5–10 mM Figure 1c for each experimental condition , a minimal number of 65 cells was recorded in four independent experiments Po0.01 for any experimental condi-tion compared with the experimental point [ Ca2 ? ] free ? 0 . A further increase in extracellular [ Ca2 ? ] free inhibited blebbing Figure 1c see also Figure 1b the bar ‘after SLO’ represents data obtained at extracellular [ Ca2 ? ] ? 2.5mM . This inhibition is most likely the consequence of a sharp elevation in [ Ca2 ? ] i in permanently permeabilized cells9 that causes generalized damage to the phospholipid bilayer and cytoskeleton and leads to a depletion of intracellular ATP levels.2 Blebbing was a universal cellular response to plasmalem-mal injury all cell types we have tested so far blebbed in response to injury irrespective of the nature of the damaging agent Figure 2 Supplementary Movies 1 and 2 . Blebbing protects injured cells . To evaluate the role of blebbing during plasmalemmal injury , we simultaneously monitored bleb dynamics and the outcome of the damage in individual living cells . The fate of the perforated cells was visualized by monitoring the intracellular dynamics of annexin A1 Supplementary Figure S1 see also Babiychuk et al. , 2009 . The number of cells manifesting an irreversible translocation of annexin A1 lysed cells was scored in blebbing cells as well as in those that failed to bleb after exposure to SLO Figure 3a . Blebbing cells were more prone to recovery after an SLO attack than were non-blebbing ones , thereby indicating that blebbing contributed to cell survival in the wake of plasmalemmal injury Figure 3b . To afford causal evidence of the protective function of blebbing , we monitored the resistance to an SLO attack by cells whose blebbing was either inhibited or activated pharmacologically . Acrylamide and calyculin – a broad-spectrum phosphatase inhibitor – are known to activate blebbing.16 Indeed , blebbing was significantly amplified in non-permeabilized HEK 293 cells that had been treated with either acrilamide or calyculin Figure 3c . Staurosporine , a broad-spectrum kinase inhibitor , W7 , an inhibitor of myosin light chain kinase , and blebbistatin are known to inhibit blebbing.16,26 In non-permeabilized HEK 293 cells , an inhibition induced by either agent was obscured by a low level of background blebbing in control cells Figure 3c . SLO permeabilization resulted in significant amplification of the background blebbing Figures 1a and 3c , d , control , which revealed the inhibitory effects of staurosporine , W7 or blebbistatin Figure 3d . In SLO-permeabilized cells that had been pre-treated with either acrylamide or calyculin , blebbing was further amplified Figure 3c and d . The analysis of the intracellular dynamics of annexin A1 revealed acrylamide-and calyculin-pre-treated cells to be more likely to withstand an SLO attack than control cells Figure 3e Supplementary Figure S2 . On the other hand , cells that had been pre-treated with staurosporine , W7 or blebbistatin were more likely to be lysed than control cells Figure 3e Supplementary Figure S2 . U373 293 HEK T-cells Jurkat B-cells Raji Accordingly , the cytoplasmic components tracked with the cytoplasmic cyan-fluorescent protein , CFP were lost more rapidly from W7-pre-treated cells than from either the control cells or the calyculin-pre-treated ones Figure 3f . Hence , cells that had been pharmacologically manipulated to bleb exten-sively were more likely to withstand a toxin attack than were cells in which blebbing had been inhibited . Damaged regions are confined to blebs . The most compelling evidence for a protective role of blebbing during plasmalemmal injury is afforded by a direct observation of blebs in action . We simultaneously monitored blebbing , an elevation in [ Ca2 ? ] i membrane translocation of annexin A1 and the loss of cytoplasm CFP-leakage in SLO-treated HEK 293 cells Figure 4 . The cell marked ‘1’ in Figure 4a did not respond to the SLO attack by blebbing Supplementary Movie 3 . After permeabilization this cell was confronted with a massive influx of Ca2 ? , which led to a global translocation of annexin A1 Figure 4a time after SLO addition ? 342 and 972 s and a complete loss of cytoplasm Figure 4a time after SLO addition ? 972 s . In contrast , cell ‘2’ in Figure 4a responded to an SLO attack by extensive blebbing Figure 4a time after SLO addition ? 252 s Supplementary Movie 3 . As for cell ‘1’ , the membrane permeability barrier in cells Non-blebbing 2 2 2 CFP Merge 5F Fluo In Figure 4b Supplementary Movie 4 , the SLO-induced elevation in Ca2 ? and leakage of CFP are documented for two blebs . An efficient permeabilization of the cell was accom-panied by a Ca2 ? elevation in both of the blebs but not in the rest of the cytoplasm Figure 4b time after SLO addition ? 765s . After permeabilization , the damaged plasma membrane of bleb ‘1’ was efficiently repaired and excess of Ca2 ? was pumped out , thereby resulting in a back transloca-tion of annexin A1 Figure 4b times after SLO addition ? 801 and 846 s . In contrast , the repair mechanism in bleb ‘2’ was inefficient the intrableb [ Ca2 ? ] remained elevated and annexin A1 remained associated with the plasma membrane Figure 4b . The loss of cytoplasm was exclusively confined to the irreversibly perforated bleb Figure 4b , arrows no leakage of cytoplasmic CFP occurred either from the repaired bleb or from the cell body . In some cells , only a transient intra-bleb translocation of annexin A1 occurred , and was followed by bleb retraction Supplementary Movie 5 . Not all blebbing cells see Figure 1a 36.4±2.4 % cells blebbing after SLO addition showed a localized intra-bleb translocation of annexin A1 17.5±2.1 % 369 cells tested in 12 independent experiments presumably , the most robust cells resealed their plasmalemmal lesions even before intra-bleb [ Ca2 ? ] elevated to the extent required for annexin A1 membrane translocation 10 mM , see Babiychuk et al. , 2009 . The protective role of blebbing during plasmalemmal injury was not restricted to the toxin attack . Supplementary Movie 6 documents a membrane injury followed by a plasmalemmal repair transient translocation of annexin A1-YFP localized within a bleb in a HEK 293 cell that had been treated with bacterial phospholipase C. Figure 4c details the protective action of blebbing in a mechanically damaged cell . A layer of U 373 cells , which form long cytoplasmic protrusions in culture , was scratched with the needle of a microsyringe above the area shown in the images . The mechanical force bent the cytoplasmic protrusion and locally injured the plasma mem-brane arrow . The damage was accompanied by a simulta-neous elevation in local [ Ca2 ? ] i , which manifested itself by a local translocation of annexin A1 Figure 4c time after scratch ? 12 s Supplementary Movie 7 . Within a few seconds , numerous blebs had sprouted around the cell body . However , the translocation of annexin A1 , which followed a substantial elevation in intrableb [ Ca2 ? ] , was observed only in the blebs of the damaged region . Bleb ‘1’ remained permeabilized , whereas bleb ‘2’ was efficiently repaired the intrableb [ Ca2 ? ] was lowered and annexin A1 back-translocated Figure 4c time after scratching ? 66 s . Fifteen minutes after scratching , annexin A1 had accumulated within the damaged region and was associated with the membranes of numerous small blebs Figure 4c time after scratching ? 900 s . These blebs were directly connected to the extracellular milieu the intrableb [ Ca2 ? ] remained high and the intrableb cytoplasm leaked out Figure 4c time after scratching ? 900 s , small arrows . However , neither a global elevation in [ Ca2 ? ] i nor a global loss of cytoplasm was observed . In the experiments described above , a selective loss of the cytoplasmic components from the damaged blebs was directly demonstrated by monitoring the leakage of CFP . The intrableb Ca2 ? elevation was indirectly assessed by monitoring the Ca2 ? -dependent translocation of annexin A1.9 To demonstrate the localized intra-bleb elevation in Ca2 ? directly , we used Fluo 5F – a Ca2 ? -sensitive fluorescent dye – which permits a monitoring of Ca2 ? fluxes in the high micromolar range . The elevation , observed in non-transfected HEK 293 cells , is documented in Figure 5 and in Supplemen-tary Movie 8 . These results also confirmed that the selective intra-bleb elevation in Ca2 ? was not a transfection artefact . It should be noted that Ca2 ? measurements with cytoplasmic fluorescent dyes reflect fairly accurately the events that occur during the initial stages of permeabilization however , they can not be applied for the evaluation of relatively long-term processes such as plasmalemmal repair . After an initial elevation , the Ca2 ? -induced fluorescent signal declines in repaired active Ca2 ? extrusion and in permanently permea-bilized cells loss of fluorescent dye alike.9 The rapid loss of fluorescent dye from perforated blebs was presumably responsible for a decreased incidence of Fluo 5F-positive blebs 8.8±1.7 % 356 cells analysed in seven independent experiments compared with the annexin A1-positive blebs 17.5±2.1 % . Taken together , these experiments demonstrate that blebbing protects damaged cells by isolating the damaged regions , thereby preventing a global loss of cytoplasm and an uncontrolled influx of Ca2 ? . Our observations also indicate that the damaged blebs are sealed off from the rest of the cytoplasm . Annexin A1 plugs damaged blebs . As it is inconceivable that even the narrow neck of a bleb can alone restrict for long the process of diffusion between the bleb and the cell body , we explored possible diffusion-blocking mechanisms . A close inspection of the blebs in recovering cells revealed a spectacular 180 333 684 693 720 801 accumulation of annexin A1 at the base of the neck region Figure 6a arrow Supplementary Movies 9 and 10 . This accumulation of annexin A1 was not a consequence of cell 120 80 CFP 60 Intracellular 40 CFP 100 70 cells 40 10 80 % 60 cells folding because it was not mirrored by a corresponding accumulation of cytoplasmic CFP Figure 6a . Among 64 cells that showed a localized intra-bleb translocation of annexin A1 , 18 cells 31.6±7 % 12 independent experiments showed a marked accretion of annexin A1 at the region of the bleb-to-cell contact 7.9±1.3-fold increase in fluorescence compared with the fluorescence within a cytoplasmic region of interest similar to that shown in Figure 6a . It should be noted that , owing to their relatively small size , some of these structures inevitably escape detection in our experimental settings , being localized outside the confocal plane even if the corresponding , much larger bleb is in focus . In the presence of Ca2 ? , annexin A1 aggregates and fuses biological membranes.25,27–29 It is , moreover , instrumental in the inward vesiculation in multivesicular endosomes – a process that is driven by a budding and fusion of the organelle-limiting membrane.30 Hence , massive , Ca2 ? -induced local accumulation of annexin A1 would cross-link the neck membranes of a bleb and efficiently block any communication between it and the rest of the cell . Annexin A1 might also trigger a sealing of the lipid bilayer within the bleb-to-cell contact region by recruiting intracellular vesicles according to the ‘classical’ resealing pathway.1,2 We tested these postulates either by inactivating annexin A1 with a blocking antibody13 or by downregulating annexin A1 expression level with siRNA . In the first set of experiments , native HEK 293 cells expressing endogenous annexin A1 were permeabilized in the presence of the antibody , which penetrated the cells via the perforated plasma membrane.6 In these cells , the SLO-induced loss of cytoplasmic CFP , collectively recorded from the whole observation field , was significantly faster than in those that had been perforated in the absence of the antibody Figure 6b . A substitution of anti-annexin A1 antibody by anti-b-actin antibody clone AC-15 of the same isotype IgG1 failed to accelerate cell lysis in SLO-perforated cells Figure 6b . When assessed individually , it was found that cells had either completely lost their cytoplasm lysed cells or , after a partial loss of CFP , were able to repair the damaged plasma membrane and thus avert a further loss of cytoplasm Figure 6c . The percentage of lysed cells was significantly higher when the perforation occurred in the presence of the anti-annexin A1 antibody Figure 6c . In the second set of experiments , annexin A1-specific siRNA was stably expressed in HEK 293 cells , resulting in a sevenfold reduction of annexin A1 protein levels Supplementary Figure S3 . In these cells , SLO-induced lysis was significantly accelerated Figure 6d . Scrambled siRNA failed to decrease annexin A1 levels Supplementary Figure S3 and had no effect on cell lysis Figure 6d . These findings demonstrate that annexin A1 is directly involved in protecting cells against plasmalemmal injury . Discussion Formerly , the blebbing of injured cells was deemed to be a harbinger of death.31 Indeed , we have ourselves observed that blebbing of some injured cells forebodes their lysis . However , here we show that injured cells that failed to bleb were prone to dying , whereas those that manifested blebbing were more likely to recover . Moreover , a pharmacologically induced increase in blebbing led to a significant increase in the cell-survival rate . Hence , in injured cells , blebbing represents a cell’s attempt to escape death rather than a mechanism promoting it . Our findings have disclosed blebbing to play a hitherto unknown role in protecting the plasma membrane during injury Figure 7 1 An injury to the plasma membrane mechanical disruption , pores formed by cytotoxic proteins , lysis of the lipid bilayer disrupts the permeability barrier , thereby permitting an influx of Ca2 ? and an efflux of the intracellular constituents not shown . 2 An injury-induced influx of Ca2 ? triggers the phosphorylation of myosin II via Ca2 ? calmodulin-dependent myosin light chain kinase . It is conceivable that myosin-driven contraction of the cortical cytoskeleton instigates a localized increase in hydrostatic pressure within the surrounding cytoplasm the plasma membrane around the lesion herniates to form a bleb containing the damaged membrane . If the cell is able to repair the membrane lesion , the elevated intra-bleb [ Ca2 ? ] is pumped out and eventually the bleb retracts not shown . If resealing fails , intra-bleb [ Ca2 ? ] continues to rise. 3 Once [ Ca2 ? ] within the perforated bleb reaches 10 mM see Babiychuk et al.9 , intra-bleb annexin A1 binds to the plasma membrane , thereby creating an ‘annexin A1 vacuum’ within the bleb . Following the concentration gradient , cytosolic annexin A1 streams from the cell body into the bleb . From the cytoplasmic side , an aperture of a slender neck of the bleb is seen as a hot-spot of inflowing Ca2 ? outside the opening the local Ca2 ? concentration decreases rapidly due to diffusion into the cytoplasm and due to a Ca2 ? sequestration by the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria . The locally elevated Ca2 ? drives annexin A1 binding to the plasma membrane in the vicinity or within of the bleb aperture . A Ca2 ? -induced formation of ceramide within the plasma membrane exposed to the Ca2 ? hot-spot might further increase the selectivity of annexin A1 binding.32 Thus concentrated , annexin A1 cross-links adjacent membranes of a slender neck of the bleb , thereby forming a plug . An efflux of cytosol is thus prevented and extracellular ‘invaders’ remain trapped within the injured bleb . The proposed mechanism accords with the observation that blebbing is not directly involved in the repair of the plasma membrane , that is , in the direct elimination of plasmalemmal lesions.8 Blebbing can be regarded as a damage-control mechanism , which is triggered after initial attempts at plasmalemmal resealing have failed . Above all , an uncon-trolled intracellular Ca2 ? overload is responsible for the death of perforated cells.9–12 Repaired blebs are able to trap and evacuate elevated levels of Ca2 ? . However , if the membrane damage is too extensive to be repaired , the damaged regions are sacrificed to spare the rest of the cell the plugged , irreversibly permeabilized blebs might be discarded by the cell.5,31 We show that an injury to the plasma membrane causes bleb formation by triggering an influx of extracellular Ca2 ? . However , in non-perforated cells blebbing can also be induced by Ca2 ? -independent mechanisms via an activation of ROCK-dependent pathways.24 This phenomenon is routi-nely observed in cells exposed to toxic substances or at the onset of apoptosis.17,18,20 Apoptotic cells , in which the Ca2 ? homeostasis is usually compromised , 33 succumb more read-ily to plasmalemmal injury than do healthy cells.9–11 The ability of environmentally stressed or apoptotic cells to undergo spontaneous blebbing suggests that they might be able to anticipate their potential repair deficiency . The spontaneous protrusion of blebs , which often cover the whole cellular surface17–19 see also Supplementary Figure S2 , calyculin Supplementary Movie 11 , shields the cell body Figure 7 , step 4 an approaching toxin would first encounter the protruding membranes of the pre-existing blebs . A toxin-induced perforation of the blebs would result in an immediate confinement of the pores within the pre-existing traps . Hence , by forestalling the time-consuming step of targeted bleb formation Figure 7 , step 2 , random blebbing before membrane damage would facilitate a speedy recovery of the perforated cells , and thus stave off an attack by invading pathogens or blood complement . Cytotoxic T-cells and natural killer cells utilize a pore-forming protein , perforin , to eliminate virus-infected cells and tumours.34,35 During perforin-induced cell death , the integrity of the plasma membrane is restored by repair responses that protect the cells from necrosis and permit granzymes to trigger apoptosis.5 We assume that blebbing is intimately involved in protecting perforin-permeabilized cells from necrosis . In support of this hypothesis , Keefe et al.5 have observed a selective accumulation of small extracellular dyes within the blebs of perforin-permeabilized cells that were undergoing apoptosis , whereas in irreversibly permeabilized , necrotic cells , the dyes were distributed throughout the entire cytoplasm . In conclusion , our study identifies a novel defence strategy that is adopted by cells as a response to plasmalemmal injury . Deficiencies in the intrinsic membrane-protection mechan-isms may contribute to the pathogenesis of degenerative , infectious and immune diseases . Therefore , further experiments are required to establish whether blebbing is involved in protection against plasmalemmal injury in vivo . Materials and Methods Reagents .

20709058	Gülgün Tezel a , b , * a r t i c l e i n f o Article history Keywords It is today’s common view that glaucoma is a multifactorial disease and many of the proposed mechanisms traditionally linked to elevated intraocular pressure IOP -related factors may facilitate disease progression independently from IOP elevation . Elevated IOP-related factors are well recognized to trigger initial neuronal damage through biomechanical and ischemic injury processes . However , a complex interplay of cellular events triggered by IOP-related or -unrelated stimuli may also amplify the primary injury process and contribute to disease progression . IOP-dependent versus IOP-independent components of the glaucomatous injury are commonly thought to be determined by individual suscepti-bility factors related with various genetic and epigenetic parame-ters yet to be further identified Weinreb and Khaw , 2004 Quigley , 2005 . Keeping the big picture of glaucoma in view , in addition to endogenous signals triggered in retinal ganglion cells RGCs , environmental influences , particularly including neuroneglia interactions , are equally important for neuronal cell death or survival decisions . Complex cellular interactions determining the RGC fate in response to glaucomatous stress also exhibit important links to different components of the immune system Tezel , 2009 . The pioneering work of Rosario Hernandez on optic nerve head astrocytes has provided important impacts in the field of glaucoma research Hernandez and Ye , 1993 Hernandez and Pena , 1997 * Department of Ophthalmology Visual Sciences , University of Louisville School of Medicine , Kentucky Lions Eye Center , 301 E.

Hernandez et al. , 2008 and inspired many other studies illumi-nating different aspects of neuroneglia interactions in glaucoma-tous neurodegeneration and immune response . Besides intrinsic signals triggered in different subcellular compartments of RGCs , signals arisen from the microenvironment are also critically important for neuronal cell fate decisions during glaucomatous neurodegeneration . Macroglial cells , including retina and optic nerve astrocytes and retinal Müller cells , constitute the major cell type exhibiting important homeostatic interactions with RGCs . Another glial cell type , also having important impacts in glaucomatous neurodegeneration , is microglia , specialized tissue macrophages . Progressive degeneration of optic nerve axons and RGCs in human glaucoma is accompanied by chronic alterations in structural and functional characteristics of glial cells in the optic nerve head Hernandez and Pena , 1997 Hernandez et al. , 2008 and retina Wang et al. , 2002 Tezel et al. , 2003 . Elevation of IOP in experimental animal models similarly results in a prominent acti-vation response of both macroglial and microglial cells Wang et al. , 2000 Naskar et al. , 2002 Lam et al. , 2003 Woldemussie et al. , 2004 Ju et al. , 2006 Inman and Horner , 2007 . Rosario Hernandez was the front-runner of experimental studies focused on the glial response to glaucomatous conditions . Over the past two decades , experimental studies using in vitro and in vivo models , along with the studies of human donor eyes , have substantially contributed to current understanding of the diverse roles of glial cells in glaucoma . Findings of these studies show that the high level of plasticity of glial cells allows them to rapidly respond to any homeostatic imbalance by exhibiting a phenotype commonly referred to as activated on the basis of changes in cell morphology and expression of cell markers Hernandez and Pena , 1997 Tezel et al. , 2003 Hernandez et al. , 2008 . Another widely accepted outcome of these studies is that after transformation into an activated phenotype , glial cells may exhibit insufficiency or dysfunction in their normal neurosupportive abilities , thereby leading to increased vulnerability of RGCs and their axons to injury Morgan , 2000 Neufeld and Liu , 2003 Hernandez et al. , 2008 Johnson and Morrison , 2009 Tezel , 2009 . Altered glial functions in glaucoma are supported by dramatic alterations in gene expression involved in signal transduction , cell proliferation , cellecell interaction , cell adhesion , extracellular matrix synthesis , and immune response Johnson et al. , 2000 Hernandez et al. , 2002 Miyahara et al. , 2003 Ahmed et al. , 2004 Steele et al. , 2006 Kompass et al. , 2008 . Despite progress in understanding of glial responses , little is known about their distinct states or temporal sequences during the course of glaucomatous neurodegeneration Nickells , 2007 . For example , a prominent increase in astrocyte reactivity has been detected early in the neurodegeneration process in different animal models of glaucoma . In contrast , the activation of microglia and the loss of oligoden-drocytes have occurred late after large-scale neuronal loss Son et al. , 2010 . In a more recent study of experimental rat glaucoma , astrocytic dedifferentiation and proliferation , rather than reactive hypertrophy , have characterized early response in the glaucoma-tous optic nerve head Johnson et al. , 2010 . These early responses of astrocytes may be important for their compromised ability to provide axonal support in early disease stages . In addition to temporal and spatial alterations in glial responses , evidence also supports distinct profiles of gene expression in optic nerve head astrocyte cultures derived from human donor eyes Miao et al. , 2008 . The population-based differences in glial responses may be related to differential susceptibility for the development and or progression of glaucomatous neurodegeneration . With an emphasis on the relative protection of glial cells from glaucomatous injury , chronic activation response of stressed glial cells may increase their own survival Tezel and Yang , 2005 but result in a lessening of their neurosupport functions . For example , the ability of glial cells in buffering extracellular glutamate may diminish in glaucoma Martin et al. , 2002 Moreno et al. , 2005 . Besides such a passive neurodestructive influence , glial cells may also be actively damaging through a range of cellular processes that promote neuronal injury . Owing to the increased production of extracellular matrix and adhesion molecules , glial cells play important roles in remodeling of the optic nerve head in glaucoma Hernandez , 2000 . Alterations in the biomechanical environment of the optic nerve head through tissue remodeling events may generate additional stress on axons Downs et al. , 2005 and inhibit axonal regeneration Silver and Miller , 2004 . A complex range of glial responses in human glau-coma also includes an increased production of cell death mediators , such as TNF-a Yan et al. , 2000 Tezel et al. , 2001 and nitric oxide Liu and Neufeld , 2000 . Experimental evidence supports that these mediators produced by glia can be directly injurious to RGCs Neufeld , 1999a Yuan and Neufeld , 2000 Nakazawa et al. , 2006 Tezel , 2008 . Among diverse roles of glial cells during glaucomatous neuro-degeneration as neurosupportive or neurodestructive , one is linked to their immunoregulatory functions . Given their roles in phago-cytosis , glial cells , mainly including microglia , are important components of immune surveillance involved in clearing and shielding of the injured tissue Nimmerjahn et al. , 2005 . Although they act as standby cells in service of both the immune system and the neuronal tissue Schwartz , 2003a Ransohoff and Perry , 2009 , microglial cells have also been associated with chronic neurode-generative diseases Streit , 1996 Stoll and Jander , 1999 . It remains unclear whether there is an insufficiency in the glial removal of cell debris that may create an antigenic stimulus for abnormal immune response . However , recent studies increasingly implicate glial cells as participants of neuronal injury . It is clear that the glial pro-inflammatory cytokines produced at increased amounts are capable of promoting RGC death signals Tezel and Wax , 2000b , besides signaling to immune system cells and regulating their function . With respect to their increased production of cytokines Tezel et al. , 2001 , immunomediators Luo et al. , 2010b and complement components Kuehn et al. , 2006 Tezel et al. , 2010 , reactive glial cells appear to be well equipped candidates to participate in innate immune injury to neurons in glaucoma . In addition to innate immune activities , glial cells are also thought to play important roles in initiation of an adaptive immune response in glaucoma Tezel et al. , 2007b . Similar to CNS glia , retina and optic nerve head glial cells express MHC molecules and function as resident antigen-presenting cells . Not only microglial cells Matsubara et al. , 1999 , but also astrocytes express HLA-DR in human glaucoma Yang et al. , 2001b . Recent proteomic and immunohistochemical findings also support an up-regulation of glial toll-like receptors TLRs in the glaucomatous human retina Luo et al. , 2010b . Besides serving in the host defense against microbial components , specific signaling through TLRs exhibits a sensitive detection system involved in the immune response to intrinsic danger signals . In vitro studies of rat retinal microglia and astrocytes have shown that components of the glaucomatous tissue stress , including up-regulated heat shock proteins HSPs and oxidative stress Tezel et al. , 2000 , 2007a , can similarly stimulate innate and adaptive immune responses through the glial TLR signaling as evident by increased cytokine production and MHC class II expression of glial cells , and increased proliferation and cytokine production of co-cultured T cells Luo et al. , 2010b . These findings support that as being local players of the immune system in the retina and optic nerve , glial cells are able to rapidly sense the tissue stress and initiate an immune response . Another immunoregulatory function of glial cells is linked to maintaining the perivascular barrier integrity Ransom et al. , 2003 Nimmerjahn et al. , 2005 . This glial function is important for securing the immune privileged status of retina and optic nerve head to protect neurons against any vision-threatening systemic effects . Cytokines produced by perivascular microglia or astrocytes Zlokovic , 2008 Banks and Erickson , 2010 Nishioku et al. , 2010 and various other glia-related alterations in the milieu may potentially contribute to a perivascular barrier dysfunction in glaucoma . For example , increased production of matrix metal-loproteinases by optic nerve head astrocytes in human glaucoma Yan et al. , 2000 Agapova et al. , 2001 may lead to degradation of the basement membrane and glia limitans consisting from astro-cytic and microglial end feet . Splinter hemorrhages at the border of the optic nerve head that are commonly detected in glaucoma patients may best exemplify the weakened perivascular barrier integrity in glaucoma Grieshaber and Flammer , 2007 . In addition to perivascular barriers , peripapillary chorioretinal atrophy zones , also commonly detected in glaucomatous eyes , exhibit another site in which the blooderetina barrier is broken . Activation and redis-tribution of microglia in the peripapillary chorioretinal regions in glaucomatous eyes further support the gatekeeper functions of these cells in controlling the bloodebrain barrier Neufeld , 1999b . Taken together , glial cells profoundly respond to glaucomatous stress by exhibiting a chronic activation response . As discussed below , glial reactivation is commonly accepted as the hallmark of neuroinflammation in the CNS . Under normal physiological conditions , glial immunoregulatory functions do not cause an immunological imbalance and their activity may promote immune privilege rather than neurodegenerative immunity . However , in the presence of accumulating risk factors , chronic glial activation may result in a dysfunction of regulatory mechanisms , thereby leading to innate and adaptive cytotoxicity Ransohoff and Perry , 2009 . It is hoped that therapeutic manipulation may help modify the outcome of glial response for the gain of RGCs and optic nerve axons in glaucoma Tezel , 2009 . An improved understanding of glial responses and functional alterations at the molecular level may offer innovative treatment options targeting glial cells so that neurodestructive consequences of the glial activation response may be selectively inhibited without compromising glial neuro-supportive and homeostastic functions . 2 . Immune system activity and diverse consequences Evidence obtained from clinical and experimental studies over the past decade strongly supports diverse roles of the immune system in glaucoma as beneficial or destructive . An immune response is initially beneficial and necessary to restore tissue homeostasis and promote tissue cleaning , healing , and function-ality without causing an autoimmune disease . As opposed to the concept that autoimmunity is a deleterious phenomenon , the intriguing view of protective autoimmunity accepts that boosting the immune activity by immunization with the appropriate antigen , at specific timing and predetermined optimal dosing can provide neuroprotection Schwartz and Kipnis , 2002 Schwartz , 2003b . Despite seemingly conflicting aspects of the immune system involvement in glaucoma , it is now commonly recognized that if there is a defect in immune response pathways due to accumulating risk factors , the physiological equilibrium may be impaired , thereby switching the beneficial immunity into an autoimmune neurodestructive process Schwartz and Ziv , 2008 Tezel , 2009 . In view of the current knowledge summarized herein , there is an increased risk of failure in immunoregulation under glaucomatous stress conditions . Increasing number of evidence provided by clinical studies support an abnormal activity of the immune system in glaucoma patients Tezel and Wax , 2007 . Many patients with glaucoma exhibit increased prevalence of monoclonal gammopathy Wax et al. , 1994 Hammam et al. , 2008 and abnormal T cell subsets Yang et al. , 2001a similar to detected in autoimmune diseases . In addition , a recent study has detected significant alterations in Th1 and Th2 cytokine levels in the glaucomatous patient serum Huang et al. , 2010 . Ongoing studies have consistently detected increased titers of serum antibodies to various retina and optic nerve antigens which commonly include HSPs Tezel et al. , 1998 Wax et al. , 1998b Maruyama et al. , 2000 Joachim et al. , 2007 Tezel and Wax , 2007 Grus et al. , 2008 . Following applications of the mass spectrometry-based techniques have resulted in an increasing list of antigens that are recognized by serum autoantibodies in glaucoma patients Joachim et al. , 2008 Reichelt et al. , 2008 Thornton et al. , 2010 . It is important to clarify that clinical studies of immune activity have initially focused on patients with normal-pressure glaucoma due to the lack of IOP-related pathogenic factors . However , not only is the distinction of such glaucoma subgroups arbitrary , but many glau-coma patients with elevated IOP may also exhibit similar findings of aberrant immune activity . In addition to primary open-angle glaucoma , a more recent study using protein macroarrays has characterized increased serum antibodies in patients with pseu-doexfoliation glaucoma Dervan et al. , 2010 . In consistence with clinical observations , growing evidence obtained from histopathological and proteomic studies of human donor tissues supports the activation of glial immunoregulation and antigen presentation functions as discussed above in the previous section . Expression of MHC class II molecules Yang et al. , 2001b , TLRs Luo et al. , 2010b , and different complement components Kuehn et al. , 2006 Stasi et al. , 2006 Tezel et al. , 2010 is up-regulated in the retina and optic nerve head of glaucomatous human eyes . There is also evidence of immunoglobulin deposition in the glaucomatous human retina Wax et al. , 1998a . As discussed above , peripapillary chorioretinal atrophy areas Wax et al. , 1998a and splinter hemorrhages Grieshaber and Flammer , 2007 , both commonly detected in glaucomatous eyes , may provide a window of opportunity to contact with the systemic immune system and facilitate the access of serum autoantibodies into the retina and optic nerve head in these patients . Findings of experimental glaucoma are also consistent with the findings of human glaucoma . Experimental studies using micro-array analysis techniques have revealed a prominent up-regulation of gene expression mediating immune response in different animal models of elevated IOP-induced glaucoma Steele et al. , 2006 Johnson et al. , 2007 Hernandez et al. , 2008 Kompass et al. , 2008 Panagis et al. , 2010 . In addition to increased glial produc-tion of immunomediators and complement molecules , these animals with experimental glaucoma also exhibit increased proliferative activity of T cells Tezel et al. , 2008 and increased titers of serum antibodies to retina and optic nerve proteins Joachim et al. , 2009 . Similar findings in different experimental paradigms suggest that the immune activity reflects a native response to tissue stress and injury . Neurons and glia normally produce immunosuppressive signals to prevent immune-mediated injury to CNS Neumann , 2001 . Similarly , retina and optic nerve are thought to have an actively regulated immune privilege mechanism Caspi , 2006 Forrester , 2009 to protect these vital tissues against damaging effects of an inflammatory immune response . Among many factors controlling the immune privilege , elimination of infiltrating reactive T cells by apoptosis is an important common pathway in preventing the development of neurodegenerative autoimmune diseases , because these cells can recruit and activate other inflammatory cells and initiate an autoimmune injury process Bauer et al. , 1998 Pender and Rist , 2001 . Despite the immune privileged status and the immunological self-tolerance to CNS , the immune system is not fully ignorant of the nervous tissue . Parallel to profound alterations in the systemic immune repertoire , there is a shift in the local milieu of the brain from immune-hostile to immune-friendly during neurodegenerative processes Wekerle et al. , 1987 Odoardi et al. , 2007 . Many factors present in glaucomatous tissues may similarly create a proper environment to form an immunological synapse with T cells for antigen presentation . Glial antigen-presenting ability is increased in human glaucoma as supported by up-regulation of MHC class II molecules Yang et al. , 2001b and increased expression of immunomediators Luo et al. , 2010b and cytokines Tezel et al. , 2001 . Meanwhile , reactive oxygen species , production of which is amplified in human glaucoma Tezel et al. , 2007a , 2010 can function as co-stimulatory molecules during antigen presentation Tezel et al. , 2007b . Based on observations in the brain , loss of RGCs and their physiological activity during glaucomatous neurodegeneration may be particularly important in rendering these neurons recognizable by the immune system cells Neumann , 2001 . Many other factors summarized below may also contribute to an aberrant immune activity in glaucoma . Not only do numerous proteins exhibit increased expression in glaucoma , but also antigen exposure is increased due to neuronal injury . Obviously , dead cells represent an important source of autoantigens that can initiate an autoimmune response . The cell death process during the course of glaucomatous neuro-degeneration may similarly cause tissue specific systemic autoim-munity , since apoptotic RGCs with self-antigens are phagocytosed by microglia , where they may be processed and presented to the systemic immune system . It seems critically important that besides increased protein expression and exposure , various proteins exhibit post-translational modifications in glaucoma , such as oxidation Tezel et al. , 2005 , phosphorylation Yang et al. , 2008 , or citrulli-nation Bhattacharya , 2009 . By changing antigenic features of proteins , these protein modifications may also facilitate an auto-immune response . Recent observations using immunoproteomic analysis techniques support the possibility of altered antigenity in glaucomatous tissues . For example , glaucomatous patient sera react more with the glaucomatous human retinal proteins as opposed to retinal proteins obtained from non-glaucomatous control donors Thornton et al. , 2010 . Among numerous proteins exhibiting an up-regulated expres-sion in glaucoma , HSPs Tezel et al. , 2000 Luo et al. , 2010b are known to be highly antigenic and have been associated with various autoimmune diseases , including neurodegenerative diseases Young , 1992 van Noort et al. , 1995 . Besides intrinsic neuroprotective abilities of intracellular HSPs , membrane-bound or extracellular HSPs after active secretion or passive release from dying neurons may serve as immunostimulatory signals . HSPs may induce cytokine production , deliver antigenic peptides to MHC class I and class II , and activate TLR signaling , thereby playing important roles in the activation of innate and adaptive immunity implicated in autoimmune diseases van Eden et al. , 2003 Calderwood et al. , 2007 . Recent experimental findings support that glial TLRs can initiate immunostimulatory signaling upon binding by glaucomatous stress-related intrinsic ligands , including HSPs Luo et al. , 2010b . In addition to TLRs , other groups of pattern recognition receptors may also be involved in the immunostimu-latory signaling in glaucoma . For example , mannose-binding lec-tins , C-type lectins Tezel et al. , 2010 , and perhaps also C-reactive proteins Leibovitch et al. , 2005 although controversial Su et al. , 2007 , may promote innate immune activity with or without acti-vating the complement system . Taken together , various cellular events that are triggered in response to glaucomatous stress stimuli may serve as endogenous danger alarm signals to the immune system , thereby stimulating an immune response . However , it is currently unclear whether the immune activity evident in glaucoma patients is merely an epiphenomenon of the disease reflecting an intrinsic effort to facilitate tissue cleaning and healing , or whether it has any path-ogenic impact on neuronal injury . For example , autoantibodies and complement components may serve to opsonize the toxic cell debris , thereby facilitating their phagocytic removal as a necessary step towards promoting axon regeneration Vargas and Barres , 2007 . Nevertheless , growing evidence obtained using in vitro and in vivo models strongly suggests that any immune activity , if uncontrolled , may have destructive consequences contributing to the progression of neurodegenerative injury . In addition to innate cytotoxicity , cellular and humoral components of the adaptive immunity may also adversely affect neuronal survival . For example , autoreactive T cells may induce RGC apoptosis in culture mainly through Fas FasL signaling Wax et al. , 2008 . Regarding humoral immunity , HSP antibodies , when exogenously applied at concen-trations similar to detected in the glaucomatous patient serum , may be internalized by retinal neurons , co-localize with the native protein , and facilitate neuronal cell death in the isolated human retina Tezel and Wax , 2000a . Moreover , complement-mediated synapse elimination may become aberrantly reactivated in mouse glaucoma Stevens et al. , 2007 . Formation of the terminal membrane attack complex in human glaucoma Kuehn et al. , 2006 Tezel et al. , 2010 may also support the possibility of collateral cell lysis by uncontrolled complement activation . As an effort to better determine the pathogenic importance of immune system activity in glaucoma , ongoing research aims to produce animal models . Although many aspects remain unclear , initial findings of these studies support that the immunization of rats with HSPs can induce RGC loss in a topographically-specific pattern resembling human glaucoma Wax et al. , 2008 . Immuno-genic neuronal injury may also be induced by adoptive transfer using a rat model of experimental glaucoma Tezel et al. , 2008 . An interesting common observation of these studies using HSP immunization Wax et al. , 2008 or adoptive transfer Tezel et al. , 2008 is an early and transient T cell infiltration into the retina and optic nerve head . Seemingly contrary to observations in animal models , virtually no T cell invasion is evident in the glaucomatous human retina or optic nerve . Although previous studies have not specifically focused on T cell infiltration using the necessary labeling techniques , it should be emphasized that the lack of observations supporting a parenchymal T cell invasion in glaucomatous tissues is not a good argument against a pathogenic role of immune activity . This is because T cell invasion is a brief temporary event . However , depending on the nature of T cells , functional status of antigen-presenting cells , and the existing set of cytokines , chemokines and co-stimulatory molecules , even a small number of T cells can be sufficient to induce a massive cascade of events leading to neuro-degenerative injury Wekerle et al. , 1987 Odoardi et al. , 2007 . An immune-mediated component of the neurodegenerative injury in glaucoma is supported by a recent study that using immune defi-cient Rag1 knockout mice which lack mature B-and T-lymphocytes has provided robust neuroprotection when compared to wild-type controls in a mouse model of experimental glaucoma McKinnon et al. , 2010 . It is also important to highlight that despite the lack of clear evidence supporting classical hallmarks of inflammation in human glaucoma , continuous glial activation in the glaucomatous retina and optic nerve head may be sufficient to indicate an ongoing neuroinflammatory process . Such an adaptive response to tissue stress has been referred to as “para-inflammation” and implicated to contribute to the initiation and progression of aging-related neurodegenerative diseases Medzhitov , 2008 Xu et al. , 2009 . This type of inflammatory response that is intermediate between the basal homeostatic state and a classic inflammatory response is likely to be more common but of lower magnitude . While the physiological purpose of para-inflammation is to restore tissue homeostasis and functionality , it may become chronic or turn into overt destructive inflammation if tissue stress or cellular dysfunc-tion persists for a sustained period Medzhitov , 2008 Xu et al. , 2009 . Thus , despite limited evidence to support a definite pathogenic role for autoimmunity in glaucoma , current knowledge agrees with the neurodegenerative potential of uncontrolled immune activity . Present evidence collectively supports that innate immune cells , autoreactive T cells , autoantibodies , and excess complement attack all are potent stimuli to harm RGC somas , axons , and synapses Tezel and Wax , 2004 , 2007 Wax and Tezel , 2009 . The risk of developing autoimmune injury seemingly depends on co-existing risk factors , which include aging , chronic tissue stress and injury , efficiency of tissue cleaning , activity status of resident and systemic immune cells , and the ability to inhibit or activate T cell entry and activation . With an emphasis on the present evidence of such risk factors in glaucoma , a neurodegenerative process may possibly be stimulated through bystander autoreactive T cell activation as opposed to induction of regulatory T cells and protective immunity . As discussed in the next section , oxidative stress appears to be particularly important for fine tuning of the homoeostatic balance in glaucoma . Once the regulation of immune activity in glaucoma is better understood , immunomodulatory treatment strategies can be designed to manipulate the immune response towards enhanced tissue repair and function , while avoiding an autoimmune neuro-degenerative injury . 3 . Glaucoma-related and aging-related oxidative stress A number of cellular events triggered during glaucomatous neurodegeneration may result in conditions of oxidative stress when amplified production of reactive oxygen species exceeds antioxidant defenses Ko et al. , 2005 . Oxidative stress , due to mitochondrial dysfunction Tezel and Yang , 2004 Osborne , 2010 and perhaps also other mechanisms , has long been linked to pathogenic mechanisms by which elevated IOP-related or -unre-lated factors result in the neurodegenerative injury to RGCs and their axons in glaucoma Levin , 1999 Osborne , 2008 Kong et al. , 2009 . Oxidative stress is intimately linked with an integrated series of cellular phenomena , which all seem to contribute to further progression of glaucomatous neurodegeneration . For example , oxidative stress leads to oxidative damage to cellular macromolecules , such as DNA , proteins and lipids , and impairs the cellular redox balance Tezel et al. , 2005 . Oxidative stress may also trigger intracellular signaling pathways by acting as a second messenger and modulating protein function by redox modifications of downstream effectors Tezel , 2006 . Ongoing studies focused on the immunogenic aspects of glaucoma support that oxidative stress is also linked to immunostimulatory signaling as discussed in the next section Tezel , 2009 . Although neurons are prone to build up oxidative stress as implicated in many neurodegenerative diseases , there is also an aging-related component of the oxidative stress . While oxidative stress increases in aging brain , the intrinsic ability of cells to respond to oxidative damage declines with increasing age . Conse-quently , increased accumulation of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species produced from endogenous metabolic pathways is a main cause for the reduced ability of neurons to cope with stressful conditions in the elderly . Similarly , aging is a well recognized risk factor for the initiation and progression of glaucomatous neuro-degeneration Gordon et al. , 2002 Broman et al. , 2008 . In addition to an aging-related decline in optic nerve axon counts and function Mikelberg et al. , 1989 Repka and Quigley , 1989 Jonas et al. , 1992 , experimental studies using animal models of glaucoma also demonstrate increased susceptibility to neuronal injury with aging Wang et al. , 2007 . Thus , oxidative stress developing through the pathogenic cellular processes of glaucoma appears to be amplified by the aging-related oxidative stress . Enhanced accumulation of advanced glycation end-products AGEs in the glaucomatous retina and optic nerve head supports an accelerated aging process in glaucomatous eyes Tezel et al. , 2007a . Parallel to aging-related loss of neurons , glial cells exhibit remarkable alterations with increasing age . For example , aging-related alterations in glial extracellular matrix production Hernandez et al. , 1989 and biomechanics Burgoyne and Downs , 2008 have been proposed to account for the clinical behavior and increased susceptibility of the aged optic nerve head to glaucoma-tous damage . Existing evidence also supports the aging-related deterioration of microglia with implications for neurodegenerative diseases . Besides aging-related alterations in cytokine and chemo-kine profiles , growth factor production , and complement activation , the aging process also adversely affects the cellular viability and self-renewal capacity resulting in the generation of dysfunctional microglia Streit , 2006 . Aging can also cause a decline in immunocompetence and impair functional interactions thatoccur between the brain and the immune system . Aging of the immune system , referred to as immunose-nescence , appears to be closely related to chronic stress-related factors , mainly including the oxidative stress . The immune system cells show an increase in oxidant and inflammatory compounds and a parallel decrease in antioxidant defenses with aging Bauer et al. , 2009 Maue et al. , 2009 Panda et al. , 2009 . Oxidative stress and accumulation of oxidation products are considered to be major factors serving as local triggers for retinal para-inflammatory responses with aging and have been associated with the pathogen-esis of aging-related retinal diseases Xu et al. , 2009 . Paradoxically to this low-grade chronic inflammation , there is an aging-related decline in immune functions as characterized by a decrease in cell-mediated and humoral immune functions Bauer et al. , 2009 Maue et al. , 2009 Panda et al. , 2009 . This aging-related impairment is thought to cause increased vulnerability to infection , cancer , and autoimmune diseases with aging . One of the key roles of oxidative stress in cell aging mechanisms is dampening the telomerase activity leading to telomere shortening . Since the adaptive immune response relies on the ability of lymphocytes to undergo periodic massive expansion , aging-related decline in immune functions has been linked to critical roles of telomeres and telomerase in T cell differ-entiation and function Kaszubowska , 2008 . Despite seemingly contradicting aspects of the aging-related alterations in immune response , such as para-inflammation versus impaired immune functions , cumulative deterioration of regulatory mechanisms and functional interactions between the neurons , glia , and immune system cells during aging appear to be critically important . Potential mechanisms that contribute to increased autoimmune and or inflammatory responses with aging include epigenetic alterations , especially DNA methylation and histone acetylation Yung and Julius , 2008 Agrawal et al. , 2010 . Thus , oxidative stress besides cellular senescence is a major factor affecting normal cellular processes in the elderly , thereby leading to a cumulative deterioration with aging . Standing the hypothesis that oxidative stress favors immune processes inducing autoimmune and or inflammatory diseases , glaucomatous tissue stress along with the aging-related factors may lead to the loss of physiological homeostasis and create an environment that is permissive to immunogenic neurodegenerative injury . Experimental studies aiming to illuminate immunogenic aspects of glaucoma support that besides inducing neuronal injury , oxidative stress-related events may also alter the regulation of immune response in many different ways . One of these events is oxidative protein modifications as detected by proteomic analysis of the retina in experimental glaucoma Tezel et al. , 2005 . Oxida-tion may change the antigenic features of these proteins , thereby serving as an immunostimulatory signal during glaucomatous neurodegeneration . Rosario Hernandez’s work has indicated that during the transition of quiescent astrocytes to reactive phenotype altered astrocyte homeostatic functions include the release of antioxidant enzymes to counteract the cytotoxic effects of oxidative stress Malone and Hernandez , 2007 Hernandez et al. , 2008 . Despite the activation of antioxidant mechanisms however , not only RGCs , but also glial cells exhibit the evidence of protein and lipid oxidation in experimental glaucoma Tezel et al. , 2005 Govindarajan et al. , 2009 . Thus , in addition to increasing anti-genity , oxidative modifications may also affect the neurosupportive and immunoregulatory functions of glial cells . Oxidized proteins , lipids , and DNA become para-inflammatory stimuli and signal to resident immune cells , mainly including microglia , to initiate an innate immune response Xu et al. , 2009 . With enhanced scavenger functions , microglial cells are able to remove oxidation products by phagocytosis . In the meantime , they may release growth factors and cytokines to promote tissue healing Schwartz , 2003a Ransohoff and Perry , 2009 . This is in the same notion proposed for regulatory T cells Schwartz and Kipnis , 2002 . However , if oxidative stress reaches to a certain level , the physio-logical homeostasis may be impaired , thereby evolving into an injury process . In this case , initial glial response expands and leads to increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines . Relevant to human glaucoma , TNF-a is a major pro-inflammatory cytokine regulated by a redox-sensitive transcription factor , nuclear factor-kappa-B Tezel et al. , 2001 . Another consequence of this cascade of events is the induction of inflammatory enzymes , such as inducible nitric oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase-2 , also evident in human glaucoma Neufeld et al. , 1997 Liu and Neufeld , 2000 . Complement activation constitutes another important compo-nent of the innate immune activities detected in glaucomatous human donor eyes Kuehn et al. , 2006 Stasi et al. , 2006 Tezel et al. , 2010 . Although complement activation serves as a tissue cleaning process , uncontrolled complement activation may also accelerate the neurodegenerative injury through cell lysis . Interestingly , oxidative stress has recently been shown to also modulate complement regulation by down-regulating an important complement regulatory molecule Tezel et al. , 2010 . Other consequences of oxidative stress facilitating an aberrant immune activity in glaucoma include the augmented generation of AGEs through oxidative stress-dependent processes Tezel et al. , 2007a . AGEs may act as persistent antigenic stimulus and also be immunostimulatory through a specific receptor RAGE -mediated signaling that leads to pro-inflammatory cytokine production Lin , 2006 . Finally , oxidative stress that provides a common trigger for many downstream pathways compromising the perivascular barrier function Pun et al. , 2009 may similarly affect blood vessels in human glaucoma Feilchenfeld et al. , 2008 . Regarding the role of oxidative stress in adaptive immune responses , a recent in vitro study has revealed that oxidative stress stimulates antigen presentation to T cells by up-regulating glial MHC class II expression and cytokine production . Findings of this experimental study also support that reactive oxygen species act as co-stimulatory molecules during antigen presentation Tezel et al. , 2007b . In addition , up-regulated expression of glial TLRs and specific signaling molecules in the glaucomatous human retina supports their involvement in innate and adaptive immune responses in glaucoma . Based on in vitro findings , oxidation products similar to stress proteins may function as intrinsic ligands of the TLR signaling in glaucoma , thereby leading to T cell stimu-lation Luo et al. , 2010b . Ongoing experimental studies provide supportive evidence that the immunoreactivity of the glaucoma-tous patient sera against oxidatively stressed retinal cell culture proteins is greater than the immunoreactivity of the same sera to control retinal proteins Luo et al. , 2010a . 5 . Concluding remarks There is no doubt that the immune system functions for neuronal maintenance and repair . But , alterations in the immune system regulation due to accumulating risk factors may shift the physiological equilibrium and switch the protective immunity into a neuroinflammatory degenerative process over a chronic and cumulative period Fig. 1 . Oxidative stress developing through the pathogenic cellular processes of glaucoma , along with the aging-related oxidative stress , appears to contribute to altered regulation of immune response in glaucoma . Thus , elevated IOP-related factors can initiate neurodegenera-tive injury in glaucomatous eyes , but seems to be only a small aspect of the big picture . A complex interplay of cellular events , including glial activation dysfunction , mitochondrial dysfunction oxidative stress , and immune response , may also amplify the primary injury process and contribute to disease progression . Oxidative stress is a major component of this cycle of cellular events . IOP-dependent versus IOP-independent components of these injurious events are likely determined by a number of indi-vidual susceptibility factors Fig. 2 . Future studies should deter-mine whether therapeutic inhibition of oxidative stress may act to break the cycle of events leading to neurodegenerative injury in glaucoma . In summary , the proposed unifying scheme of multiple cellular processes integrates different risk factors , including neurodegen-erative insults , glial activation response , aging , and oxidative stress , with the altered regulation of immune response in glaucoma . Based on the view that alterations in the regulation of immune response have important impacts in glaucomatous neurodegeneration , an improved understanding of the regulatory mechanisms can help therapeutic modulation of the immune response to restore tissue homeostasis in the retina and optic nerve . Ongoing studies with the advent of refined experimental models and emerging sophisticated analysis techniques promise to expand the current knowledge and offer new treatment possibilities for glaucoma patients .

Various proteins in the Bcl-2 family are key positive or negative regulators of apoptosis . They share conserved regions called Bcl-2 homology domains BH1 , BH2 , and BH3 . Biochemical and subcellular fractionation studies localized the antiapoptotic members , such as Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL , at the outer mitochondrial membranes OMMs and at the endo-plasmic reticulum and nuclear membranes . Proapoptotic factors either reside at the OMM , as is true for Bak , or are cytosolic proteins in unstimulated cells , as is the case for Bax , Bid , and Bad . Although it is very well known that Bax and Bak are crucial for the induction of apoptosis in many systems , the molecular www.nature.com cdd details of Bax-mediated apoptotic events are still unclear see , e.g. , Antignani and Youle2 . A diversity of stimuli have been suggested as initiators of the activation of Bax and Bak , 3,4 including direct stimulation by BH3-only proteins such as Bid or Bim.5,6 Bax activation is believed to be a highly regulated , multistep process involving mitochondrial translocation and oligomerization , and this process ultimately leads to mito-chondrial dysfunction and apoptosis.7,8 Upon the induction of apoptosis , Bax migrates to the mitochondria , where it is integrated into the outer membrane as a monomer . Bax monomers then oligomerize and may form large pores in the OMM.8 In its inactive form , Bak is constitutively present in mitochondrial membranes and is released from inhibitory binding partners upon apoptotic stimulation . Bax and Bid , as well as Bcl-xL and Bcl-2 , form pores in synthetic lipid vesicles and membranes.9–12 . The ability of Bax to form ion-conducting pores in synthetic and mitochondrial membranes suggests that such pores are involved in the release of cytochrome c.13–15 Bax however might work as a twin-arginine translocation Tat -like protein rather than as an always-open ion-conducting pore in the OMM.2 Bcl-2-like proteins have also been shown to interact with some mitochondrial components . Evidence points to interactions between Bax and the machinery involved in mitochondrial fission and fusion see , e.g. , Youle and Karbowski16 and Scorrano17 . Bcl-xL interacts with the adenine nucleotide translocator , an important component of the permeability transition pore complex , and it has been proposed that this interaction prevents cell death.18 It has also been suggested that Bcl-2 as well as Bax interact with the voltage-dependent anion channel.19,20 We have recently shown that OMM-integrated Bax directly interacts with and inhibits an inner membrane-located mitochondrial potassium channel , Kv1.3,21 in lymphocytes.22 Kv1.3 has been shown to be expressed in different tissues and cell types , including brain , lymphocytes , macrophages , liver , and skeletal muscle.23 The absence of Kv1.3 in lymphocytes prevents Bax-induced release of cytochrome c , as well as changes in mitochondrial membrane potential and the production of reactive oxygen species ROS . In a previous study we showed that wild-type WT Bax inhibits Kv1.3 and induces the release of cytochrome c from isolated mitochondria , whereas Bax with a single-point mutation K128E does not induce this effect.22 According to a model of the structure of the membrane-integrated Bax monomer , at least amino acids 127 and 128 , located between the fifth and sixth helices of Bax , protrude from the OMM into the intermembrane space.8 We determined that Bax binds to the vestibule region of the channel via lysine 128 and preincubation of Bax with recombinant Kv1.3 prevents its proapoptotic effects in isolated mitochondria.24 The physiolo-gical relevance of Kv1.3 for apoptosis was illustrated by the facts that knockdown of Kv1.3 expression in human peripheral blood lymphocytes impaired apoptosis in these cells , and expression of mitochondria-targeted Kv1.3 was sufficient to sensitize apoptosis-resistant CTLL-2T lymphocytes , which lack Kv channels.22 In this study , we test the function of BaxK128E in a cell system and analyze the mechanism of Bax–Kv1.3 inter-actions using a mutant of Bcl-xL as a model . We report that mutation of lysine 128 in Bax to glutamate Glu Bax K128E abrogates the proapoptotic function of Bax in a cellular context . The critical role of lysine 128 in Bax for the induction of apoptosis is demonstrated by the finding that exchange of Glu158 of Bcl-xL corresponding to K128 in Bax with lysine converts Bcl-xL into a proapoptotic protein . Results Previous findings22 demonstrated that Bax requires lysine 128 to induce apoptotic events in isolated mitochondria . The mutation of lysine 128 in Bax prevents the release of cytochrome c and the depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane , events that were observed after the incubation of isolated mitochondria with WT Bax . These findings indicate that the highly conserved positively charged lysine of Bax plugs the pore of the mitochondrial potassium channel Kv1.3 , and thereby initiates mitochondrial changes during apoptosis . Antiapoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL in various species contain a negative charge in the position corresponding to that of K128 in Bax amino acid aa 158 for Bcl-xL Figure 1 . In these proteins , a conserved lysine arginine precedes this glutamate . Thus , whereas in proapoptotic Bcl-2-like proteins an isolated positive charge is found at aa 128 , in antiapoptotic Bcl-2-like proteins the positive charge at aa 157 is counter-balanced by a negative charge at position 158 , resulting in a net charge of zero in antiapoptotic proteins at this site . The absence of a net positive charge at this site is expected to prevent inhibition of Kv1.3 by the antiapoptotic Bcl-2-like proteins , even if they are in close contact with each other . On the basis of these considerations , and to gain insight into the mechanism of Kv1.3–Bax interaction , we replaced Glu158 in Bcl-xL with a lysine . Bcl-xLE158K caused a marked inhibition of Kv1.3 in patch-clamp experiments on Jurkat T lymphocytes Figure 2A , comparable to that caused by WT Bax Figure 2B IC50 of 5 nM for Bcl-xLE158K IC50 of 4 nM for WT Bax . In contrast , neither WT Bcl-xL nor mutant BaxK128E or GST altered Kv1.3 currents Figures 2C–E , and Szabo´ et al.22 . Bax and margatoxin MgTx competed for the same binding site on Kv1.3 Figure 2F , further supporting a specific interaction of Bax with the pore region of Kv1.3 and the notion that proapoptotic Bcl-2-like proteins mimic the interactions of Kv1.3-inhibiting toxins.24 To show that mutant Bcl-xL induces changes in mitochon-dria similar to those induced by WT Bax , we incubated purified Jurkat mitochondria with recombinant GST-Bax lacking the C-terminal transmembrane domain and therefore able to insert into the membrane25 , GST-Bcl-xL , GST-Bcl-xLE158K , or GST as a control . Recombinant GST-Bax and full-length Bax induced very similar effects on isolated mitochondria.22 Recombinant GST-Bax triggers a hyperpolarization followed by a decrease of the potential of the inner mitochondrial membrane IMM Figure 3a . The electrochemical gradient for K ? predicts that K ? should enter the matrix through a potassium channel located in the IMM . If the influx of K ? becomes inhibited , hyperpolarization is expected . Depolar-ization , which followed hyperpolarization , was inhibited by cyclosporin A CSA and , thus , was probably mediated by the opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore PTP see Supplementary Material in Szabo ´ et al.22 . The transmembrane potential of Kv1.3-containing Jurkat mito-chondria was not altered by incubation with GST alone , GST-BaxK128E , 22 or GST-Bcl-xL Figure 3a . In contrast , marked hyperpolarization followed by depolarization was observed when mitochondria were treated with GST-Bcl-xLE158K Figure 3a . Likewise , the mutant GST-Bcl-xLE158K , similar to GST-Bax and truncated Bid tBid -preactivated full-length Figure 2 Effect of Bax and Bcl-xL mutants on Kv1.3 current . Representative experiments with Jurkat cells are shown . A Mutant Bcl-xLE158K gray , control black , after addition of 20 nM GST-Bcl-xLE158K inhibited current within 450 s IC50 5 nM , n ? 3 . B In the same experimental setup , the addition of wild-type Bax inhibited current conduction gray , control black , 315 s after the addition of 15 nM GST-Bax . C BaxK128E does not reduce Kv1.3 current gray , control black , 450 s after addition of 20 nM recombinant GST-BaxK128E to bath . D The addition of 40 nM GST a , control trace b , 10 min after addition does not decrease the amplitude of Jurkat whole-cell Kv1.3 current elicited by applying voltage pulses to ? 70 mV from a holding potential of 50 mV every 45 s . E Results of a representative experiment in which voltage pulses ranging from 110 to ? 90 mV were applied at 20-mV steps . Traces show currents recorded in the absence gray or presence black of 50 nM wild-type GST-Bcl-xL 10 min after addition . F BaxK128E and MgTx compete for the same binding site . Jurkat lymphocytes were incubated for 20 min with 10 nM BaxK128E . Please note that BaxK128E was added in solution where it may have a conformation allowing its docking to the rim of the channel however , in the absence of the critical lysine residue that plugs the pore , inhibition does not take place . The seal was established , and the current was recorded at ? 70 mV in the absence gray and presence black of 12 nM MgTx in the same experiment . In other experiments , 6 nM MgTx caused a rapid , complete inhibition of Kv1.3 see inset . Shown are representative studies from at least three independent experiments Bax Figure 3b , triggered a massive release of mitochondrial cytochrome c , whereas GST-Bcl-xL had no effect Figure 3c see Figure 3d for purity control . Importantly , the proapoptotic effects of Bax and GST-Bcl-xLE158K were abrogated in mitochondria isolated from CTLL-2 pJK cells lacking Kv1.3 Figures 3b and c . This finding indicates that the Bcl-xLE158K , similar to Bax , exerts its action by regulating Kv1.3 activity in mitochondria isolated from CTLL-2 Kv1.3 cells . To test the function of the mutant Bcl2-family proteins in intact cells , we transfected mouse embryonic fibroblasts MEFs deficient for both Bax and Bak double knockout DKO MEFs with expression vectors for WT Bax , Bax K128E , or Bcl-xLE158K . Bax Bak-deficient cells are widely used for determining the effect of mutant Bcl-2 proteins in a cellular context and on isolated mitochondria see , e.g. , Nie et al.4 and Gavathiotis et al.5 . The transfection of DKO MEFs with WT Bax or Bcl-xLE158K restored apoptosis induced by staurosporine , etoposide , or sphingomyelinase , whereas transfection with BaxK128E failed to restore apoptosis in these cells Figures 4a–c . The cytochrome c release induced by staurosporine in Bax or mutant Bcl-xLE158K-expressing MEF DKO cells was inhibited by CSA Figure 4d , suggesting a possible involvement of the PTP in this experimental setup . To avoid a possible proapoptotic effect of protein over-expression per se , the stoichiometry of transfection was adjusted to yield amounts of protein close to those found in untransformed WT cells . The protein levels were determined in the transfected and stimulated cells by western blot and fluorescence-activated cell sorter FACS which permits us to determine the expression of Bax in the population also investigated for apoptosis and were similar to the levels of Bax endogenously expressed by WT MEFs Figures 4a and b . To confirm that Bax interacts with Kv1.3 via lysine 128 , we co-transfected Kv1.3 and BaxK128E or WT Bax into MEF DKO cells , induced apoptosis with staurosporine , lysed cells , and determined co-immunoprecipitation of the proteins . The results Figure 4e show that the BaxK128E mutant failed to bind Kv1.3 , whereas WT Bax and Kv1.3 interacted after induction of apoptosis . To exclude that the lack of proapoptotic effects of mutant BaxK128E in DKO MEFs Figure 4 and in CTLL-2 cells22 may be caused by alterations of the membrane-insertion capability and or of the pore-forming properties of Bax by the mutation , we addressed whether the Bcl-2-family proteins used in our studies can efficiently insert into mitochondria . Figure 5a illustrates that mutant recombinant Bax and Bcl-xL are able to insert into MEF DKO-isolated mitochondria as efficiently as the WT recombinant Bax and Bcl-xL , as assayed by alkaline extraction . Activation and oligomerization of Bax can be detected by analyzing resistance of Bax to trypsin.26 In particular , following these events , amino acids at the N-terminus of Bax become susceptible to trypsin digestion the rest of the protein is protected , giving rise to truncated Bax of 15 kDa . In our system , in mitochondria isolated from DKO MEF cells , the recombinant Bax WT and Bax mutant equally give rise to such a truncated form revealed using an antibody against aa 1–171 of Bax D21 , indicating that the mutated version of Bax is still able to form higher-order oligomers Discussion In this work we provide insights into the mechanisms of action of the proapoptotic Bcl-2-family protein Bax , namely the inhibition of mitochondrial Kv1.3 . We also show that an inactive mutant of Bax forms ion-conducting channels similar to those formed by WT Bax , a finding indicating that Bax does not exert its action during apoptosis merely by forming ion-conducting oligomers . The data obtained with Bcl-xLE158K are consistent with the model we recently proposed for the action of Bax.22 WT Bax inhibits Kv1.3 , a potassium-selective channel of the IMM , and exhibits actions similar to those exerted by margatoxin and charybdotoxin , which block the channel with high specificity.22 These toxins possess a crucial lysine that blocks the channel by binding to the ring of four aspartate residues of the channel vestibule . Position 128 in Bax , which folds out of the OMM after insertion , 8 corresponds to a highly conserved lysine . If lysine 128 were important for the proapoptotic action of Bax via inhibition of Kv1.3 , we expect that introducing a positive charge at the corresponding position in Bcl-xL turns this antiapoptotic protein into a blocker of Kv1.3 with proapoptotic effects . Our results confirm this hypothesis and show that the addition of Bcl-xLE158K to isolated mitochondria efficiently blocks Kv1.3 and induces hyperpolarization and the release of cytochrome c . DKO MEFs were used to verify the effect of these mutations in a cellular context . The fact that mutant Bcl-xLE158K inhibits Kv1.3 and is sufficient to restore cell death in cells lacking Bax and Bak strongly indicates that the crucial lysine residue mediates inhibition of the channel it may also be important for the physical interaction between Bax and Kv1.3 . A single amino acid residue seems to be sufficient to mediate strong protein–protein interactions as previously shown by the observation that , for instance , a point mutation of K27 in agitoxin reduces the affinity of the toxin for the KcsA K ? channel 130-fold . In agreement , data shown in Figure 4e indicate that BaxK128E does not interact with Kv1.3 . The existence of various potassium channels in the IMM of different tissues has been reported see , e.g. , Zoratti et al.27 and references therein . Mitochondrial potassium channels permit K ? transport into the mitochondrial matrix , regulating thus mitochondrial volume homeostasis , changes in mito-chondrial membrane potential , respiration , pH gradient , and synthesis of ROS.28 In various systems , open potassium channels seem to keep the PTP closed.29 Kv1.3 was recently found in mitochondria of prostate cancer and breast cancer cell lines PC3 and MCF-7,24 in hippocampal neurons , 30 and in astrocytes.29 The observation that the ring of negatively charged amino acids in the pore of potassium channels is structurally highly conserved in all voltage-gated potassium channels see , e.g. , Rauer et al.31 suggests that the action of Bax may not be limited to Kv1.3 . Mutations at K128 in Bax and at E158 in Bcl-xL have not been previously reported , but other point mutations have been shown to alter the activity of Bax and Bcl-xL . Recently , Gavathiotis et al.5 described a point mutation of Bax K21E that identifies a novel structural location of Bax activation . Cysteine 62 of Bax was shown to be critical for its conformational activation and proapoptotic activity in response to H2O2-induced apoptosis.4 These results , like ours , point to the importance of a single amino acid for protein– protein interaction and for the proapoptotic efficiency of Bax . Lysine 128 in Bax and the Glu158 in Bcl-xL are not located within the BH3 domain , making therefore unlikely that these amino acids are involved in the dimerization process of Bax or Bcl-xL . With regard to the possibility that Bax mutations may cause alterations in the release of cytochrome c , Heimlich et al.32 reported that the Bax-induced release of cytochrome c from mitochondria depends on a-helices 5 and 6 , a region comprising K128 . However , the effect of these deletions in intact cells has not been investigated . Regarding Bcl-xL , a G138A mutation abrogates the ability of Bcl-xL to dimerize with Bax and prevents the inhibition of cell death induced by deprivation of IL-3 or dexamethasone in the murine prolym-phocytic IL-3-dependent cell line F5.12.33 It should be noted that we mutated Bcl-xL to analyze the role of a critical lysine in Bax for the induction of apoptosis . Our studies demonstrate that a point mutation in Bcl-xL converts the protein into a proapoptotic protein , whereas the mutation of Bax at K128 prevents the induction of apoptosis by Bax . Thus , lysine 128 in Bax plays a crucial role in the induction of apoptosis in a cellular model . The findings further support the notion that Bax induces apoptosis via the direct inhibition of a mitochondrial potassium channel by plugging the pore with K128 . We would like to point out that we do not propose Bcl-xL to interact with Kv1.3 in vivo the Bcl-xL mutant was used as a tool to reinforce the evidence concerning the importance of the lysine residue in Bax . Recombinant Bax can directly insert into membranes with the a-helices 5 and 6 , and it can also spontaneously oligomerize see , e.g. , Antonsson et al.25 . In vitro experi-ments have shown that Bax oligomers are able to conduct cytochrome c.14,25,34 These findings , and the observation that some proteins from the Bcl-2 family form ion-conducting pores Figure 6 Kv1.3-dependent and -independent release of proapoptotic factors from mitochondria in CTLL-2 cells . Smac Diablo a and HtrA2 Omi b are released by GST-Bax and tBid independently of Kv1.3 expression . Mitochondria were isolated from CTLL pJK and CTLL Kv1.3 cells and were incubated with 5 nM GST or GST-Bax . Mitochondria were pelleted and the release of Smac Diablo and HtrA2 Omi into the supernatants was visualized by western blotting . Shown are representative results from at least three independent experiments . Purity of supernatants was controlled as in Figure 3d not shown . c CTLL-2 pJK and CTLL-2 Kv1.3 cells were left untreated c or treated with staurosporine ST and lysed . Mitochondria were separated from cytosolic fraction and both fractions were assayed for the release of cytochrome c , Smac , EndoG , and AIF . In the case of Smac , fractions obtained from cells incubated with cyclosporine A CSA and ST ST ? CSA were loaded . Purity of cytosolic fractions from the same experiment was tested using an antibody against the outer mitochondrial protein Tom20 upon reconstitution in artificial membranes , 10–13 suggest that cytochrome c may cross the OMM through an aqueous channel formed by assembled Bax monomers , Bak mono-mers , or hetero-oligomers of both proteins . Our findings do not contradict this hypothesis , but indicate that a Kv1.3-dependent event is necessary for the release of cytochrome c upon the interaction of Bax with mitochondria . Formation of Bax oligomers and pore formation by Bax in the OMM may well occur independently of Kv1.3 , as suggested by the release of Smac Diablo and HtrA2 Omi occurring indepen-dently of Kv1.3 . On the other hand , the Bax mutant is efficiently inserted and activated in mitochondria Figure 5 , and is able to form oligomers and ion channels and mediate the release of Smac Diablo and HtrA2 Omi Figures 5–7 yet , cytochrome c is not released with mutant Bax and cell death is impaired Figure 4 . The notion that Bax itself is not sufficient alone for mediating the efflux of cytochrome c from mitochon-dria has been also demonstrated by other investigations on the roles of cardiolipin35 and Opa-136 in controlling the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria . Similar to cytochrome c , the release of AIF and EndoG are Kv1.3 dependent Figure 6 . AIF and EndoG have been proposed to be released in a ROS-dependent way from mitochondria.37,38 Given that Kv1.3 inhibition by Bax leads to an increase in ROS release , 22 one possible explanation for our findings is that Kv1.3 is only involved in ROS-mediated mobilization release of proapopto-tic factors . Further work is required to prove this hypothesis . Bax and mutant Bcl-xL expressed in MEF DKOs induced a CSA-sensitive cytochrome c release , pointing to a possible involvement of PTP in this process , at least in our experi-mental setup . CSA may have additional effects in intact cells , and data by Schinzel et al.39 obtained in cyclophilin-D-less Bax and Bak containing MEFs argue against the involvement of PTP in staurosporine-induced apoptosis . Thus , the role of PTP in MEF death is controversial and further work is required to definitively exclude or prove its role . In summary , we demonstrate for the first time a single-point mutation in Bcl-xL that converts the protein into a proapoptotic protein , both in experiments with isolated mitochondria and in MEF cells . Our work addresses the mode of action of a single-point mutant of Bax in a cellular context , and shows that the Bax mutant loses its ability to mediate cell death . Further work is required to understand how general this feature of Bax action is and to further investigate the role of Kv channels and or other potassium channels in general in Bax-mediated apoptosis.40 Cell cultures . Jurkat lymphocytes and CTLL-2 cells were grown in RPMI-1640 supplemented with 10 % fetal calf serum , 10 mM HEPES pH 7.4 , 2 mM L-glutamine , 1 mM sodium pyruvate , 100 mM nonessential amino acids , 100 units ml penicillin , 100 mg ml streptomycin all from Life Technologies , Karlsruhe , Germany , and 50 mM b-mercaptoethanol . Mouse interleukin-2 IL-2 4 units ml Roche Diagnostics , Mannheim , Germany was added daily to CTLL-2 cells American Type Culture Collection ATCC , Manassas , VA , USA . DKO MEFs and control cells both kindly provided by L Scorrano were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium DMEM Gibco , Milan , Italy supplemented as above without HEPES . If indicated , we added 2 mM CSA . Transfections . The lipofectamine technique was used as described by the supplier Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA , USA to co-transfect DKO MEFs with 2 mg 106 cells pJK Kv1.3 and 5 mg each of the expression vectors pcDNA-Bax , pJK-K128E Bax , or pJK-E158K Bcl-xL so that the MEFs would express WT Bax , K128E Bax , or E158 K Bcl-xL . Expression of Kv1.3 was confirmed by FACS analysis not shown . The pJK plasmid contains a single chain antibody with a Myc-Tag . The transfected MEF cells were sorted using anti-Myc-Tag antibodies and magnetic beads 36 h after transfection and then incubated for another 24 h . Alternatively , MEF cells were co-transfected with 2 mg pcDNA-EGFP-actin so that transfected cells could be detected or the cells were stained with FITC-coupled anti-Myc 9E10 antibodies to identify transfected cells for transfection with pJK-E158K Bcl-xL . Dead cells were removed after 12 h , and the cells were then cultured in DMEM supplemented as above for an additional 36 h and used for functional tests . For CTLL-2 cells we obtained stable clones by transfecting CTLL-2 cells with 40 mg 107 cells of pJK Kv1.3 or pJK plasmids by electroporation and culturing them with 800 mg ml G418 Sigma , Deisenhofen , Germany . All experiments except for selection of clones were performed with the bulk cell population . All cultures were re-established from frozen stocks after 4 weeks of growth . Cells were depleted of IL-2 before all experiments to avoid interference by signaling from the IL-2 receptor . To this end , cells were washed in 132 mM NaCl , 20 mM HEPES pH 7.4 , 5 mM KCl , 1 mM CaCl2 , 0.7 mM MgCl2 , and 0.8 mM MgSO4 H S and allowed to recover for 3 h in cell culture medium without IL-2 . Recombinant proteins . Bax amino acids 1–170 was cloned into pGEX-3X as GST fusion protein , expressed in BL21A1 , and purified from bacterial lysates using glutathione-sepharose . Bacteria were lysed in 50 ml of 25 mM HEPES pH 7.4 , 0.1 % SDS , 0.5 % sodium deoxycholate , 1 % Triton X-100 , 125 mM NaCl , 10 mM each NaF , Na3VO4 , and sodium pyrophosphate , 10 mM each aprotinin and leupeptin A L , and 1 mg ml lysozyme . Samples were incubated on ice for 15 min so that lysis could be completed , and DNA was degraded with 5 mg ml DNAaseI in 30 mM MgCl2 for 30 min . After insoluble material had been pelleted by a 50-min centrifugation at 11 000 g at 41C , the GST fusion proteins in the supernatant were immobilized by incubation with 300 ml glutathione sepharose GE Healthcare , Chalfont St. Giles , UK for 1 h at 41C . The beads were extensively washed so that any detergents could be eliminated and 20 mM glutathione was added to elute the fusion protein . Glutathione was removed by dialysis and the samples were concentrated to 1 ml by several centrifugation rounds through size-exclusion columns cutoff , 10 000 Da Viva Science Sartorius , Gottingen , ¨ Germany . The K128E mutant of Bax and the E158K mutant of Bcl-xL were obtained by a site-directed mutagenesis PCR technique Stratagene , La Jolla , CA , USA , cloned into pGEX-3X , and expressed and purified as a GST fusion protein as above . In the present study we used a GST-DC-Bax , which lacks the C-terminal transmembrane domain and does not require activation by tBid , for insertion into the membrane and induction of cytochrome c release.25 Cellular apoptosis assays . To detect the release of mitochondrial cytochrome c and Smac , transfected MEF cells were either left untreated or treated with staurosporine for 12 h , washed in cold HEPES saline , incubated for 30 min at 41C in 0.3 M sucrose , 10 mM TES pH 7.4 , and 0.5 mM EGTA TES buffer and then Dounce-homogenized . Nuclei and unbroken cells were pelleted by centrifugation for 5 min at 600 g and 41C . Supernatants were centrifuged at 6000 g for 10 min at 41C . The supernatants were used to detect released cytochrome c or Smac Diablo , and the pellets were used to detect mitochondrial cytochrome c . Proteins were separated on 15 % SDS-PAGE , blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane , and developed with a monoclonal mouse anti-cytochrome c antibody clone 7H8.2C12 BD Biosciences Pharmingen , San Diego , CA , USA or with anti-Smac antibody and the Tropix ECL system Bedford , MA , USA . Morphological signs of apoptosis , such as DNA condensation , nuclear fragmentation , and blebbing , were detected by staining non-permeabilized cells with 4 mg ml propidium iodide and 4 mg ml ethidium bromide . This method also differentiated apoptotic and necrotic cells . To detect cytochrome c , AIF , Smac , Omi , and EndoG release in intact CTLL-2 cells , the cells were treated with 1 mM staurosporine with or without 2 mM CSA for 12 h . After incubation , the cells were collected , washed with phosphate-buffered saline PBS , re-suspended in 150 ml of TES buffer , and incubated on ice . Cells were broken with an electric homogenizer 60 s . Unbroken cells were separated by centrifugation at 600 g for 10 min at 41C . Mitochondria were separated from cytosol by centrifugation at 7000 g at 41C for 10 min . Mitochondria were re-suspended in TES buffer . Both cytosolic fraction and mitochondria were analyzed by western blot . Alkaline extraction and trypsin treatment . Mitochondria were isolated as described by Szabo ` et al.22 1 106 DKO MEFs cells sample were washed with PBS and centrifuged for 10 min at room temperature at 450 g . The cells were then re-suspended in 1.5 ml of TES Buffer and incubated in ice for 30 min . After 150 strokes with a glass teflon potter , intact cells were pelleted by centrifugation for 10 min at 41C at 600 g . Mitochondria were separated by centrifugation of the resulting supernatant at 6000 g for 10 min at 41C and washed in 500 ml of buffer 1 50 mM PIPES-KOH pH 7.4 , 50 mM KCl , 2 mM MgCl2 , 2 mM EGTA , 10 mg ml A L , 2 mM ATP , 10 mM phosphocreatine , 5 mM succinate , and 50 mg ml creatine kinase . Mitochondria were then incubated with GST-Bax , or GST-K128E Bax , or GST-Bcl-XL or GST-E158K Bcl-XL 20 nM each for 30 min on ice . Na2CO3 0.1 M final concentration was added and samples were incubated for further 30 min on ice . Mitochondrial fraction and supernatant were separated by centrifugation at 20 000 g for 10 min at 41C . To assess Bax activation oligomerization , isolated mitochondria were treated with trypsin 0.51 mg ml final concentration for 1.5 h at 301C . Reaction was stopped by addition of equal volume of buffer 1 containing twofold concentrated protease inhibitors . Mitochondrial fraction and supernatant were separated by centrifugation at 20 000 g for 10 min at 41C and the former was assayed for the presence of Bax by western blot , using N-20 antibody Santa Cruz , Santa Cruz , CA , USA produced against a peptide mapping the N-terminus of Bax or D21 antibody Santa Cruz against an epitope corresponding to amino acids 1–171 of Bax . Cytochrome c and Smac Diablo release from isolated mitochondria . Mitochondria obtained from 1 106 CTLL-2 or MEF cells were isolated as described above and were incubated for 30 min on ice in buffer 1 with 5 nM GST-Bax , or 5 nM K128E GST-Bax , or 5 nM GST , or 5 nM tBid , or 15 nM GST-Bcl-2 , or 15 nM GST-Bcl-xL , or 15 nM E158K GST-Bcl-xL , or 0.1 nM tBid ? 20 nM full-length Bax tBid and full length Bax were co-incubated for 15 min at 371C prior to addition to the mitochondria to achieve activation of Bax so that chimeric proteins could bind to mitochondria . The very low concentration of tBid is sufficient to activate full-length Bax in vitro , but too low to stimulate low amounts of Bax and Bak associating with the outer membrane of isolated mitochondria . The mitochondria were then pelleted and re-suspended in pre-warmed buffer 1 371C and incubated for 5 min . The reaction was terminated by the addition of one volume of ice-cold buffer 1 , centrifugation at 20 000 g at 41C . The supernatants were transferred into new tubes . Reducing SDS sample buffer was added to the supernatants and the pellets . The samples pellet and supernatant were analyzed for the release of cytochrome c or Smac Diablo by western blotting . described in Szabo ` et al.21 in Jurkat cells . Leak currents were not subtracted . The bath solution was composed of 150 mM NaCl , 5 mM KCl , 2.5 mM CaCl2 , 1 mM MgCl2 , and 10 mM HEPES pH 7.3 . The intracellular solution contained 134 mM KCl , 1 mM CaCl2 , 2 mM MgCl2 , 10 mM EGTA , and 10 mM HEPES pH 7.3 . Intracellular voltages are reported , and outward currents are plotted upwards . Membrane potential in isolated mitochondria . The membrane potential of isolated mitochondria was determined by incubating purified mitochondria from Jurkat cells with 5 nM GST-Bax , or 5 nM GST-BaxK128E , or 5 nM GST , or 5 nM tBid , or 15 nM GST-Bcl-xL , or 15 nM GST-Bcl-xL E158K in buffer 1 supplemented with 10 nM 3,3 0 -dihexyloxacarbocyanine iodide DioC6 3 , for 30 min at 41C . Mitochondria were then pelleted and re-suspended in pre-warmed buffer 2 containing 10 nM DioC6 3 , and the transmembrane potential Dcm was determined by flow cytometry . Hyperpolarization increases the accumulation of DioC6 3 in mitochondria , as indicated by a right shift of the fluorescence signal depolarization is indicated by a left shift . Complete depolarization of mitochondria was achieved by incubation with 1 mM carbonyl cyanide 3-chlorophenylhydrazone CCCP for 10 min at room temperature and served as a control for the integrity of the mitochondria . The experiments were repeated with the Dcm indicator tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester TMRE and yielded very similar results . Flow cytometry studies . To identify cell death in pJK-K158E Bax-transfected cells , the cells were stained with FITC-coupled anti-Myc9E10 antibodies to detect the Myc-epitope present on the single chain antibody , which is also encoded by the pJK vector . Death was detected by staining with Cy3-labelled Annexin . Samples were analyzed using FACS-Calibur Becton-Dickinson , Franklin Lakes , NJ , USA . Co-immunoprecipitation . For the co-immunoprecipitation experiments , transfected MEFs were stimulated with staurosporine , lysed in 4 % CHAPS , 5 mM MgCl2 , 137 mM KCl , 1 mM EDTA , 1 mM EGTA , 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0 , and 10 mg ml aprotinin and leupeptin , and Bax Bax K128E or Kv1.3 were immunoprecipitated from the lysates employing protein A G agarose . The immunoprecipitates were washed six times in the lysis buffer , separated by 7.5 or 12.5 % SDS-PAGE , blotted , and developed with anti-Kv1.3 or anti-Bax antibodies . An aliquot of the immunoprecipitates was blotted with the immunoprecipitating antibody to test for similar amounts of protein in all samples . Control immunoprecipitates were performed with isotype-matched irrelevant antibodies . Specificity of immunoprecipitations was proven with CTLL-pJK cells lacking Kv1.3 expression data not shown . Patch-clamp experiments . Whole-cell currents were recorded with an EPC 7 amplifier List , Darmstadt , Germany filter , 1 kHz sampling rate , 5 kHz , as Planar lipid bilayer . A Warner Instruments Hamden , CT , USA BC-525C electrophysiological planar bilayer apparatus was used . Bilayers with a capacity of approximately 150 to 200 pF were prepared by painting a decane chloroform solution of soybean asolectin Sigma , Milan , Italy , partially purified by precipitation with cold acetone from a chloroform solution , across a 250-mm hole in a polystyrene cuvette . The inside of the cuvette constituted the trans compartment . The standard experimental medium contained 100 or 150 mM KCl , 0.5 mM EGTA , and 8 mM HEPES pH 7.5 . After the planar membrane had formed , salt concentration gradients were produced by adding equal volumes of the standard medium in the trans compartment and a medium with the same composition except for a higher concentration of KCl in cis . The contents of both chambers were stirred by magnetic bars when necessary . Connections to the electrodes were provided by agar bridges . Protein was added to the cis side . Voltages reported are those of the cis chamber , and current is considered positive when carried by cations flowing from the cis compartment to the trans compartment . Output was recorded with a 10-KHz bandwidth on videotape using a Medical Systems New York , NY , USA PCM-2 interface . The data were later analyzed offline using the pCLAMP program set Molecular Devices , Sunnyvale , CA , USA . Acknowledgements .

Biochim Biophys Acta 2009 1787 351–363 . Figure 5b . In accordance , BaxK128E is able to induce the release of Smac Diablo from these mitochondria , similar to Bax WT , whereas the release of cytochrome c is impaired when using mutant Bax Figure 5c . Smac Diablo is released not only from isolated mitochondria using recombinant proteins , but also in MEF DKO cells transfected with mutant Bax Figure 5d see Figure 5e for purity control of cytosolic fraction . Importantly , the effects of recombinant GST-Bax and full-length Bax22 on isolated mitochondria and those of Bax expressed in MEF cells are the same Figures 3 and 4 . These results further indicate the ability of Bax and of BaxK128E to form oligomers in the outer membrane and to allow the exit of Smac Diablo , but also point to another event , that is , inhibition of Kv1.3 by Bax , necessary for the release of cytochrome c . This compulsory proapoptotic event does not take place with BaxK128E see Figure 4c , or in the absence of Kv1.3.22 The notion that interaction of Kv1.3 with Bax is important for the release of cytochrome c but not for the oligomerization of Bax , is further indicated in Figures 6a and b , where in isolated mitochondria , Smac Diablo and HtrA2 Omi release occurs independently of the presence of Kv1.3 upon incubation with recombinant Bax , suggesting that interaction of the channel with Bax is involved mainly in cytochrome c mobilization rather than in its translocation through the OMM . We tested proapoptotic factor release also in intact CTLL-2 pJK and CTLL-2 Kv1.3 cells challenged with staurosporine . In accor-dance with data of Figures 3 , and 6a and b , cytochrome c is released in a Kv1.3-dependent manner , whereas Smac release occurred also in the absence of the channel . The release of Smac was insensitive to CSA Figure 6c . In contrast , the release of AIF and endoG required expression of Kv1.3 and was absent in CTLL-2-pJK treated with stauros-porine Figure 6c . Finally , we tested whether recombinant Bax WT and BaxK128E may form channels by incorporating these proteins into planar lipid bilayer . The BaxK128E was able to insert into liposomes and oligomerize as assayed by crosslinking with disuccinimidyl suberate Figure 7a . Both WT and mutant Bax proteins formed channels in this system only when added at very high up to 16 nM WT n ? 28 mutant n ? 20 concentrations . Although the activities differed , the differ-ences were within the range of the variability displayed by Bax channels from one experiment to the other . Note in Figure 7b that the amplitude of the concentration gradient-driven current passing through the pores at zero applied voltage the condition believed to prevail at the OMM and the kinetic behavior current traces are similar for the WT and mutant channels . 
20977550	Introduction The protein p97 , also known as valosin-containing protein VCP in mammals , CDC-48 in Caenorhabditis elegans and Cdc48p in yeast , belongs to the AAA ATPases associated with diverse cellular activities family and is evolutionarily conserved in eukaryotes Woodman 2003 . p97 plays important roles in a wide variety of diverse cellular processes , including homotypic membrane fusion Latterich et al. 1995 Rabouille et al. 1995 , nuclear envelope reassembly Hetzer et al. 2001 Ramadan et al. 2007 , cell cycle regulation Moir et al. 1982 Mouysset et al. 2008 , endoplasmic reticulum–associated degradation Ye et al. 2001 Braun et al. 2002 Rabinovich et al. 2002 , the ubiquitin–proteasome system Dai Li 2001 , and preventing polyglutamine aggregation Higashiyama et al. 2002 Yamanaka et al. 2004 Kobayashi et al . 2007 . The underlying molecular function of p97 in these processes is believed to be as a segregase . p97 converts chemical energy generated from ATP hydro-lysis into mechanical force used for protein conforma-tional changes such as unfolding of proteins and disassembly of protein complexes Patel Latterich 1998 Rape et al. 2001 Braun et al. 2002 . p97 is composed of an amino-terminal N domain and two AAA ATPase domains termed D1 and D2 and forms a hexameric double-ring complex Rouiller et al. 2002 DeLaBarre Brunger 2003 . Several cofactors bind to the N domain and regulate the multiple functions of p97 . The Ufd1-Npl4 heterodimer binds to the N domain of p97 and accelerates the degradation of ubiquitylated proteins in the ubiquitin–proteasome system Rape et al. 2001 Ye et al. 2003 . Another cofactor , p47 , a member of the family of UBX ubiquitin regulatory X domain–containing proteins , binds the N domain of p97 and the resulting complex plays an important role in nonproteolytic regulation of homotypic membrane fusion Kondo et al. 1997 Buchberger et al. 2001 . The UBX domain is composed of approximately 80 amino acid residues . UBX domain–containing proteins are found in all eukaryotes Buchberger et al. 2001 Schuberth Buchberger 2008 . The three-dimensional structure of the UBX domain resembles that of ubiquitin Buchberger et al. 2001 Dreveny et al. 2004 Yuan et al. 2004 . The UBX domain directly interacts with p97 at a hydrophobic pocket in the N domain Dreveny et al. 2004 , and recent reports have showed that UBX family members are the largest group of general cofactors for p97 Schu-berth et al. 2004 . However , the cellular functions of UBX family proteins have not yet been elucidated , especially in multicellular organisms . Caenorhabditis elegans is the simplest multicellular model animal and is a powerful tool for the analysis of developmental processes . C. elegans has two p97 homologues , CDC-48.1 and CDC-48.2 collectively CDC-48.1 ? -48.2 , and embryogenesis depends on the function of at least one of these homologues Yamanaka et al. 2004 . CDC-48.1 ? -48.2 also play important roles in endoplasmic reticulum–associated degradation , cell cycle regulation in S-phase , extraction of Aurora B kinase from chromatin , germ-line devel-opment , and progression through meiotic metaphase I Mouysset et al. 2006 , 2008 Ramadan et al. 2007 Sasagawa et al. 2007a , b , c , 2009 . The UFD-1-NPL-4 cofactor is required for CDC-48.1 ? -48.2 function in most of these processes Mouysset et al. 2006 , 2008 Ramadan et al. 2007 Sasagawa et al. 2007c , 2009 . Our previous systematic expression analysis showed that the differential expression of UBX proteins in C. elegans is regulated spatiotemporally Yamauchi et al. 2007 . However , the cellular functions of UBX family proteins remain unclear . In this study , we found that the C. elegans UBXN UBX domain–con-taining protein in nematode proteins UBXN-1 , UBXN-2 and UBXN-3 bound to the N domain of CDC-48.1 ? -48.2 and localized in spermatocytes . We propose that C. elegans UBXN-1 , UBXN-2 and UBXN-3 positively regulate spermatogenesis via the degradation of TRA-1A the terminal effector of the sex determination pathway . Results All UBXN proteins directly interact with CDC-48.1 ? -48.2 Caenorhabditis elegans possesses six UBXN proteins , UBXN-1 to UBXN-6 Fig. 1A . To investigate whether UBXN proteins are cofactors for CDC-48.1 ? -48.2 , we analyzed the interaction between UBXN proteins and CDC-48.1 ? -48.2 using yeast two-hybrid analysis . Full-length UBXN-1 , UBXN-2 , UBXN-3 , UBXN-5 and UBXN-6 interacted with full-length CDC-48.1 ? -48.2 , whereas full-length UBXN-4 did not Table 1 and Fig. S1 in Supporting Information . Using the topological prediction pro-gram TMHMM version 2.0 http www.cbs.dtu.dk services TMHMM , we found that UBXN-4 con-tains a putative transmembrane TM segment adja-cent to the UBX domain Fig. 1A . It is therefore possible that the putative TM segment disrupted the interaction in this assay . Indeed , truncated UBXN-4 lacking the C-terminal region including the putative TM segment UBXN-4DTM interacted with both CDC-48.1 ? -48.2 Table 1 and Fig. S1 in Supporting Information . These results show that all six C. elegans UBXN proteins interact with CDC-48.1 ? -48.2 . CDC-48.1 ? -48.2 are comprised of the N domain , two AAA domains D1 and D2 and the conserved C-terminal DDDLY motif Fig. 1B . The three-dimensional structure of the UBX domain resembles that of ubiquitin , and the UBX domain interacts with the N domain of p97 Dreveny et al. 2004 . We found that the UBX domain in UBXN-3 UBXN-3UBX interacted with CDC-48.1 ? -48.2 Table 1 and Fig. S1 in Supporting Information . Furthermore , truncated CDC-48.1 ? -48.2 lacking the N domain CDC-48.1DN and CDC-48.2DN did not interact with UBXN-1 , UBXN-2 , UBXN-3 , UBXN-3UBX , UBXN-4DTM or UBXN-5 Table 1 and Fig. S1 in Supporting Information . These results imply that UBXN-1 through UBXN-5 interact with the N domain of CDC-48.1 ? -48.2 and that they may func-tion as N-terminal cofactors for CDC-48.1 ? -48.2 . In contrast , UBXN-6 still interacted with CDC-48.1DN and CDC-48.2DN Table 1 and Fig. S1 in Supporting Information , suggesting that UBXN-6 interacts with CDC-48.1 ? -48.2 via a domain other than the N domain . UBXN-6 contains a PUB peptide N-glycanase ? ubiquitin-associated or UBX-containing proteins domain in addition to the UBX domain Fig. 1A . Mammalian PUB domains from peptide N-glycanase and Ufd3 interact with the C-terminal TM UBX 432 aa DDDLY motif of p97 Zhao et al. 2007 , and thus , peptide N-glycanase and Ufd3 are C-terminal cofactors for p97 . C. elegans CDC-48.1 ? -48.2 also contain the highly conserved DDDLY motif at their C-termini Fig. 1B . A C. elegans Ufd3 homologue , UFD-3 C05C10.6 , interacted with CDC-48.1 , CDC-48.2 , CDC-48.1DN and CDC-48.2DN , but it did not interact with CDC-48.1DDDD803NNNN , CDC-48.2DDDD804NNNN , CDC-48.1Y808E or CDC-48.2Y809E mutants Table 1 and Fig. S2 in Supporting Information , indicating that UFD-3 interacts with CDC-48.1 ? -48.2 at the C-terminal con-served motif and acts as a C-terminal cofactor for CDC-48.1 ? -48.2 . Interestingly , although UBXN-6 interacted with CDC-48.1DN , CDC-48.2DN , CDC - 48.1DDDD803NNNN , CDC-48.2DDDD804NNNN , CDC - 48.1Y808E and CDC-48.2Y809E mutants , it did not interact with CDC-48.1DN , Y808E or CDC-48.2DN , Y809E Table 1 and Fig. S2 in Supporting Information . These results suggest that UBXN-6 interacts with the N domain as well as the C-terminal DDDDLY motif of CDC-48.1 ? -48.2 . Table 1 Summary of yeast two-hybrid assays To confirm the direct interaction between UBXN proteins and CDC-48.1 ? -48.2 in vitro , we carried out a pull-down assay using purified proteins . GST-fused UBXN proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified . GST-UBXN-5 could not be purified because of protein aggregation . Purified His-tagged CDC-48.1 ? -48.2 Nishikori et al. 2008 and GST-fused UBXN proteins were mixed and pulled down using affinity beads for GST proteins . Unconjugated GST proteins did not interact with CDC-48.1 ? -48.2 Fig. 2 . All UBXN proteins directly interacted with CDC-48.1 ? -48.2 Fig. 2 , indicating that C. elegans UBXN family proteins are cofactors for CDC-48.1 ? -48.2 . UBXN-1 , UBXN-2 and UBXN-3 are involved in gametogenesis and embryogenesis To elucidate the cellular functions of UBXN pro-teins , we carried out RNAi experiments . Each dou-ble-stranded RNA dsRNA was injected into the body cavity of C. elegans N2 wild-type young adult hermaphrodites . Embryos laid by the worms at 12– 36 h after injection were pooled and observed . RNAi targeting of each individual ubxn gene did not lead to any obvious phenotype e.g . embryonic lethality , lar-val lethality , morphogenesis defects or sterility Fig. 3 and data not shown . These results are consistent with an exhaustive RNAi study that also showed that the depletion of individual ubxn genes did not yield a detectable phenotype Sonnichsen et al. 2005 . We next injected a mixture of dsRNAs for all ubxn genes kDa marker I P I P I P I P I P I P 120 WB CDC-48.1 100 120 * 100 80 * * * * 60 50 WB GST * 25 120 100 WB CDC-48.2 50 WB GST into wild-type worms . We found that simultaneous RNAi of all ubxn genes conferred approximately 50 % embryonic lethality Fig. 3 . The remaining 50 % of embryos hatched and grew into adult worms , but 50 % of these F1 escapers were sterile Fig. 3 . When we omitted the dsRNA for ubxn-5 , embryonic lethality and sterility were the same as that assessed with the mixture of all the ubxn dsRNAs . When we further omitted the dsRNA for either ubxn-4 or ubxn-6 , they were the same as that assessed with the mixture of all the ubxn dsRNAs . In contrast , when we omitted the dsRNA for either ubxn-1 , ubxn-2 or ubxn-3 , both lethality and sterility were dramatically reduced Table S1 in Supporting Information . We found that simultaneous RNAi of ubxn-1 , ubxn-2 and ubxn-3 induced approximately 50 % embryonic lethal-ity and 60 % progeny sterility , a phenotype similar to that observed with simultaneous RNAi of all ubxn genes . Importantly , embryonic lethality and sterility were again dramatically reduced when dsRNA for either ubxn-1 , ubxn-2 or ubxn-3 was omitted Fig. 3 . Note that these phenotypes were observed only when using the microinjection procedure , and not by feed-ing the dsRNAs to the worms . To examine whether simultaneous RNAi of ubxn-1 , ubxn-2 and ubxn-3 effectively depleted the expres-sion of all three proteins , we first generated individual antibodies against UBXN-1 , UBXN-2 and UBXN-3 . The calculated molecular masses of UBXN-1 , UBXN-2 and UBXN-3 are approximately 32.9 kDa , 32.6 kDa and 71.7 kDa , respectively . Using Western blotting , anti-UBXN-1 and anti-UBXN-2 antibodies detected single bands at 39 kDa and 36 kDa , respec-tively , whereas two bands of 72 kDa and 85 kDa were detected by anti-UBXN-3 antibody Fig. S3 in Supporting Information see Discussion . Signals for the corresponding bands were significantly reduced in RNAi-treated worms and in the deletion mutants Fig. S3 in Supporting Information . Furthermore , in simultaneously knocked down worms , the amounts of UBXN-1 , UBXN-2 and UBXN-3 were greatly reduced Fig . S3 in Supporting Information , suggest-ing that our RNAi strategy was effective . Taken together , these results suggest that UBXN-1 , UBXN-2 and UBXN-3 are involved in gametogenesis and embryogenesis . UBXN-1 , UBXN-2 and UBXN-3 cooperatively control spermatogenesis in hermaphrodites We previously reported that CDC-48.1 ? -48.2-depleted or UFD-1-depleted worms are sterile , which is caused by a defect in germ-line development Sasagawa et al. 2007c Fig. 4 . UFD-1 forms a heterodimer with NPL-4 and is a well-characterized cofactor for p97 ? CDC-48 Meyer et al. 2000 Bruderer et al. 2004 Mouysset et al. 2006 . In addition , simultaneous RNAi of UBXN-1 , UBXN-2 and UBXN-3 [ hereafter referred to as ubxn-1 ? -2 ? -3 RNAi ] resulted in the progeny sterility as shown in Fig. 3 . Thus , we next analyzed their dissected gonads . We found that germ-line development appeared normal in ubxn-1 ? -2 ? -3 RNAi worms Fig. 4 . These results indicate that CDC-48.1 ? -48.2 and their cofactor UFD-1-NPL-4 are essential for germ-line development , but the cofactors UBXN-1 , UBXN-2 and UBXN-3 are not . Furthermore , whereas the depletion of CDC-48.1 ? -48.2 or UFD-1 induces the unfolded protein response Sasagawa et al. 2007c , ubxn-1 ? -2 ? -3 RNAi did not data not shown . C. elegans wild-type hermaphrodites produce sperm in the early L4 stage , and subsequently produce oocytes in the late L4 and adult stages Ellis Schedl 2006 Kimble Crittenden 2007 . Finally , self-fertilized eggs are produced using sperm and oocytes in the adult stage . Interestingly , fertilized eggs were not observed in the uterus of ubxn-1 ? -2 ? -3 RNAi worms Fig. 5A , although their germ-line development appeared normal Fig. 4 . Furthermore , oocytes were tightly stacked in these sterile worms Fig. 5A , which is a typical phenotype observed in worms that do not have sperm Shimada et al. 2006 . Indeed , sperm were not observed in spermathecae of these sterile worms Fig. 5A . In addition , major sperm protein MSP , which is a marker of sperm Ward 1987 , was also not observed in spermathecae Fig. 5B . These characteristics were consistent with a feminization of germ-line FOG phenotype , in which the germ-line produces only oocytes and not sperm . Interestingly , ubxn-1 ? -2 ? -3 RNAi males produced sperm normally Fig. 5A . Furthermore , after crossing with ubxn-1 ? -2 ? -3 RNAi males , the ubxn-1 ? -2 ? -3 RNAi hermaphrodites started to produce fertilized eggs Fig. 5A . These results indicate that UBXN-1 , UBXN-2 and UBXN-3 are specifically involved in spermatogenesis in hermaphrodites . We previously reported that CDC-48.1 ? -48.2 and the UFD-1-NPL-4 cofactor are required for both germ-line develop-ment and spermatogenesis Sasagawa et al. 2007c , 2009 . Deletion of either CDC-48.1 or CDC-48.2 causes decreased sperm production Sasagawa et al. 2009 . These results together imply that the CDC-48.1 ? -48.2 complexes containing UBXN-1 , UBXN-2 and UBXN-3 positively regulate spermatogenesis . UBXN-1 , UBXN-2 and UBXN-3 are expressed in spermatogenesis We previously examined the spatial and temporal expression patterns of ubxn genes using GFP transla-tional fusion constructs Yamauchi et al. 2007 . UBXN-1 GFP , UBXN-2 GFP and UBXN-3 GFP are all expressed in embryos and spermathecae . How-ever , the expression of the GFP reporter from extra-chromosomal arrays is generally suppressed in gonads because of the silencing mechanism . To precisely investigate the localization of UBXN-1 , UBXN-2 and UBXN-3 in gonads , we carried out a cytological analysis using the antibodies shown in Fig. S3 in Sup-porting Information . As described above , sperm are generated at the early L4 stage in C. elegans hermaph-rodites Kimble Crittenden 2007 . Dissected gonads from wild-type hermaphrodites at the early L4 stage were fixed and stained with each of the anti-UBXN proteins antibodies and with anti-MSP antibody . MSP was localized in spermatogenic germ cells and mature sperm white-lined region in Fig. 6A . UBXN-1 , UBXN-2 and UBXN-3 were relatively strongly expressed in proximal gonads where MSP is localized , although UBXN-1 , UBXN-2 and UBXN-3 were ubiquitously localized in the gonads Fig. 6A . More precisely , UBXN-1 , UBXN-2 and UBXN-3 primarily localized at the periphery of spermatocyte nuclei , but not in mature sperm white arrows in high-magnification images in Fig. 6A . Importantly , UBXN-1 , UBXN-2 and UBXN-3 colocalized with CDC-48 at the periphery of spermatocyte nuclei Fig. 6B . These results suggest that UBXN-1 , UBXN-2 and UBXN-3 together with CDC-48.1 ? -48.2 are involved in spermatogenesis , but not in the maintenance of mature sperm . UBXN-3 binds to the CDC-48-UFD-1-NPL-4 complex in vivo We showed a direct interaction between CDC-48.1 ? -48.2 and UBXN-1 , UBXN-2 and UBXN-3 proteins in vitro as shown in Fig. 2 . We also showed A Hermaphrodite Spermatheca B the evidence of genetic interaction between ubxn-1 , ubxn-2 and ubxn-3 and cdc-48 Table S1 in Support-ing Information . Embryonic lethality and progeny sterility of depletion of ubxn-1 , ubxn-2 or ubxn-3 were dramatically enhanced in the cdc-48.1 tm544 or cdc-48.2 tm659 background . To investigate their in vivo interaction , we carried out a pull-down assay using lysates from the XA7203 strain , which expresses FLAG-tagged CDC-48.1 under the control of its own promoter and 3¢ untranslated region Sasagawa et al. 2009 . When lysates were treated with anti-FLAG M2 affinity gels , FLAG-tagged CDC-48.1 was precipitated Fig. 7 . We found that UBXN-3 and UFD-1 coprecipitated with FLAG-tagged CDC-48.1 Fig. 7 , suggesting that UBXN-3 and UFD-1 interact with FLAG-tagged CDC-48.1 in vivo . In contrast , UBXN-1 and UBXN-2 did not coprecipi-tate with FLAG-tagged CDC-48.1 , or amounts of precipitated UBXN-1 and UBXN-2 were below the detectable levels , under the experimental conditions we used Fig. 7 . This might reflect that the associa-tion of UBXN-1 and UBXN-2 to CDC-48 is weak and transient . It is also possible that binding affinity of UBXN-1 and UBXN-2 to CDC-48 becomes much weaker when other cofactors coexist . It is important to mention that when compared with the amount of UFD-1 coprecipitated with FLAG-tagged CDC-48.1 , only a small amount of UBXN-3 copre-cipitated Fig. 7 , suggesting that CDC-48 interacts with UFD-1 much stronger than UBXN proteins . Considering that functional diversity of CDC-48 is mainly determined by differential binding of distinct cofactors , it seems reasonable that the binding of UBXN proteins to CDC-48 is not stable in vivo . Alternatively , an unknown factor or modification such as phosphorylation , acetylation or ubiquitylation on UBXN proteins and ? or CDC-48 may be involved in the regulation of interaction between UBXN proteins and CDC-48 positively and ? or neg-atively . It is also possible that the interaction between UBXN proteins and CDC-48 is regulated spatiotem-porally in vivo . However , this issue remains elusive see Discussion . As described earlier , UFD-1 forms a heterodimer with NPL-4 Meyer et al. 2000 Bruderer et al. 2004 Mouysset et al. 2006 , and UFD-1-NPL-4 and UBXN-3 are N-terminal cofactors for CDC-48.1 ? -48.2 . UBXN-3 does not interact with UFD-1 and NPL-4 in a yeast two-hybrid assay Sasagawa et al. 2009 . p97 forms a ring-shaped homo-hexamer Rouiller et al. 2002 DeLaBarre Brunger 2003 . Therefore , one hexamer has six N-domains , and dif-ferent N-terminal cofactors can bind to each of the six p97 monomers in the hexamer Rumpf Jentsch 2006 Jentsch Rumpf 2007 . To elucidate whether A UBXN-1 UBXN-2 UBXN-3 DAPI UBXN MSP Merge High-magnification images of white-lined region Sp SpCyt Sp SpCyt Sp SpCyt DAPI UBXN MSP Merge Merge B UBXN-1 UBXN-2 UBXN-3 DAPI UBXN Merge UFD-1-NPL-4 and UBXN-3 bind simultaneously to CDC-48.1 ? -48.2 , we prepared the strain XA7205 , which expresses C-terminally FLAG-tagged NPL-4.1 . FLAG-tagged NPL-4.1 was efficiently precipitated using anti-FLAG M2 affinity gels Fig. 7 . Both UFD-1 and UBXN-3 coprecipitated with FLAG-tagged NPL-4.1 Fig. 7 , strongly suggesting that UFD-1-NPL-4 and UBXN-3 bind simultaneously to CDC-48.1 ? -48.2 . UBXN-1 , UBXN-2 and UBXN-3 are involved in sex determination The sex determination system plays an important role in spermatogenesis in C. elegans . TRA-1A is the termi-nal effector of the sex determination pathway and inhibits spermatogenesis Hodgkin 1987 Zarkower Hodgkin 1992 Ellis Schedl 2006 . The tra-1 e1099 loss-of-function mutant shows the masculinization of germ-line phenotype , in which the germ-line produces only sperm frequency 20 of 20 analyzed . As shown in Fig. 5 , ubxn-1 ? -2 ? -3 RNAi worms showed the FOG phenotype . In contrast , when the tra-1 e1099 mutant was targeted for RNAi by ubxn-1 ? -2 ? -3 RNAi , all progeny showed the masculinization of germ-line phenotype frequency 20 of 20 analyzed , implying that the tra-1 e1099 mutation completely suppressed the FOG phenotype caused by ubxn-1 ? -2 ? -3 RNAi . These results indicate that UBXN-1 , UBXN-2 and UBXN-3 are involved in sex determination in C. elegans . TRA-1A is degraded by the CUL-2 ubiquitin ligase complex , which contains FEM-1 , FEM-2 and FEM-3 Starostina et al. 2007 . TRA-1A accumulates control NPL-4.1 control NPL-4.1 FLAG FLAG marker 120 100 FLAG CDC-48.1 [ unc-119 + ] , XA7203 unc-119 ed3 cdc-48.1 tm544 qaIs7201 [ Pcdc-48.1-FLAG CDC-48.1 , unc-119 + ] and XA7205 unc-119 ed3 qaIs7202 [ Pnpl-4.1-NPL-4.1 FLAG , unc-119 + ] . The XA7203 and XA7205 strains express FLAG CDC-48.1 and NPL-4.1 FLAG , respectively . The XA7200 strain was used as a negative control . All strains were incubated at 25 ? C . approximately 4.8-fold compared to wild type in the fem-3 loss-of-function mutant that shows the FOG phenotype Starostina et al. 2007 Fig. 8 . We found that TRA-1A accumulated approximately 4.7-fold in ubxn-1 ? -2 ? -3 RNAi worms compared to wild type . We previously reported that CDC-48.1 ? -48.2 also play an important role in TRA-1A degradation by interacting with the CUL-2 complex Sasagawa et al. 2009 . These results suggest that UBXN-1 , UBXN-2 and UBXN-3 , which are N-terminal cofactors for CDC-48.1 ? -48.2 , positively regulate spermatogenesis via TRA-1A degradation . marker wild-type worms . The temperature-sensitive mutant fem-3 e2006 was incubated at 25 ? C beginning at the embryo stage and showed the feminization of germ-line FOG phenotype at the adult stage . FOG worms n 100 , which appeared following the simultaneous knockdown of UBXN-1 , UBXN-2 and UBXN-3 , were dissolved in sample buffer . Equal amounts of extracted protein from each type of worm at the adult stage were loaded . Signals were detected with anti-TRA-1A and anti-actin antibodies . We detected a 114-kDa band that was TRA-1A . The amounts of TRA-1A and actin were quantified using IMAGE GAURAGE software , and relative intensities of the bands in the various lanes are shown below each lane . We previously reported that CDC-48 controls the sperm–oocyte switch by regulating CUL-2-mediated TRA-1A proteasome degradation Sasagawa et al. 2009 . RPN-10 is a component of the 19S regulatory particle of proteasomes , recognizes poly-ubiquitin chains and delivers poly-ubiquitylated substrates to the 20S proteasome Shimada et al. 2006 . We there-fore asked if UBXN-1 , UBXN-2 and UBXN-3 are involved in the ubiquitin–proteasome system . We found that UBXN-3 bound directly and strongly to K48-linked poly-ubiquitin chains Ub2–7 Fig. 9A , B . It has been reported that human FAF1 , a homologue of C. elegans UBXN-3 , binds to poly-ubiquitin chains through its N-terminal UBA domain Song et al. 2005 . Therefore , it is possible that the UBA-like domain of UBXN-3 may be responsible for poly-ubiquitin WB kDa I P I P I P I P 28 14 B AU 2 Ub quantity 100 Relative 50 RNAi control ubxn-1 -2 -3 RNAi rpn-10 RNAi and ubxn-1 ? -2 ? -3 RNAi rpn-10 RNAi , 100 % 80 ? 80 . binding . Weak but significant binding to poly-ubiquitin was observed for UBXN-1 and UBXN-2 , while GST alone did not bind Fig. 9A , B . These results suggest that UBXN-1 , UBXN-2 and UBXN-3 are able to bind to the protein degradation signals . We then analyzed if ubiquitin–proteasome system is involved in spermatogenesis . The simultaneous treat - ment with ubxn-1 ? -2 ? -3 RNAi and rpn-10 RNAi induced a complete FOG phenotype compared to the individual knockdown Fig. 9C . These results suggest that UBXN-1 , UBXN-2 and UBXN-3 interact with RPN-10 genetically and that ubiquitin–proteasome system plays an important role in spermatogenesis . Discussion In this study , we showed that all of the six C. elegans UBXN proteins are cofactors for CDC-48.1 ? -48.2 UBXN-1-5 are N-terminal cofactors and interestingly UBXN-6 is an N-terminal as well as C-terminal co-factor for CDC-48.1 ? -48.2 . Recent reports have also shown that UBXD1 , a human homologue of UBXN-6 , binds to the N domain and C-terminal motif of p97 Madsen et al. 2008 Kern et al. 2009 , which is consistent with our results . However , Kern et al. 2009 showed that the UBX domain of UBXD1 is not involved in the binding to p97 , and instead the N-terminal domain of UBXD1 is responsible for the binding to the N domain of p97 . The UBX domain binds through a highly conserved R…FPR motif of exposed side chains to the N domain of p97 Dreveny et al. 2004 . Because key residues within the R…FPR motif are not conserved in UBXD1 homologues including UBXN-6 , the UBX domain of UBXD1 is considered not to contribute to the binding to p97 Madsen et al. 2008 data not shown . Therefore , which domain of UBXN-6 is responsible for the binding to the N domain of CDC-48.1 ? -48.2 remains unknown . Although RNAi targeting of each individual ubxn gene did not lead to any obvious phenotype , RNAi combination of ubxn-1 , ubxn-2 and ubxn-3 caused sterile and embryonic lethal . We found that the sterile hermaphrodites showed the FOG phenotype in which the germ-line develops normally but produces only oocytes and not sperm . Males produced sperm normally even when all three proteins were simulta-neously knocked down . CDC-48.1 ? -48.2 are also involved in spermatogenesis in hermaphrodites , but not in male Sasagawa et al. 2009 . UBXN-1 , UBXN-2 and UNXN-3 colocalized with CDC-48.1 ? -48.2 at the periphery of spermatocyte nuclei . Furthermore , immunoprecipitation IP analysis using C. elegans lysates showed that at least UBXN-3 inter-acted with CDC-48 in vivo . These results indicate that UBXN-1 , UBXN-2 and UBXN-3 together with CDC-48.1 ? -48.2 are cooperatively involved in hermaphrodite-specific spermatogenesis . How can cdc-48.1 tm544 mutants develop sperm cells , while ubxn-1 ? -2 ? -3 RNAi hermaphrodites do not , if UBXN proteins cooperate with CDC-48 ? It should be emphasized that C. elegans possesses two CDC-48 homologues , namely CDC-48.1 and CDC-48.2 , whose functions are essential and redundant Yamanaka et al. 2004 , and that both CDC-48.1 and CDC-48.2 are involved in spermatogenesis Sasagawa et al. 2009 . UBXN-1 , UBXN-2 and UNXN-3 are essential for spermatogenesis as cofactors of CDC-48.1 ? -48.2 . Therefore , sperm cells can be developed in the cdc-48.1 tm544 deletion mutants , in which CDC-48.2 , UBXN-1 , UBXN-2 and UNXN-3 are fully functional . Thus , cdc-48.1 tm544 mutants develop sperm cells , whereas ubxn-1 ? -2 ? -3 RNAi hermaphrodites do not . We detected two forms of UBXN-3 . Based on the molecular size , the lower band 72 kDa may corre-spond to UBXN-3 calculated molecular mass 71.7 kDa , and the upper band 85 kDa may be a post-translationally modified UBXN-3 or an alterna-tively spliced form of UBXN-3 . Alternatively , con-sidering that both bands were detected by the anti-GST antibody in the case of N-terminally GST-fused UBXN-3 and that the lower band was not coprecipi-tated with CDC-48 , it is possible that the lower band might be generated by the truncation from the C-ter-minal end in which the UBX domain locates . At present , however , the biological significance of two forms of UBXN-3 remains elusive . The FOG phenotype was previously reported in rpn-10 tm1180 , fem-1 lf , fem-2 lf and fem-3 lf mutants Ellis Schedl 2006 Shimada et al. 2006 Kimble Crittenden 2007 . Recent reports have showed that spermatogenesis is positively regulated by the ubiqu-itin–proteasome system via degradation of the sex determination factors TRA-1A and TRA-2 Shimada et al. 2006 Starostina et al. 2007 Sasagawa et al. 2009 . RPN-10 , a component of the proteasome 19S regula-tory particle , is involved in the degradation of TRA-2 , which inhibits spermatogenesis Shimada et al. 2006 . FEM-1 , FEM-2 and FEM-3 form a complex with CUL-2 ? Cullin2 and function as an E3 ubiquitin ligase , which promotes TRA-1A ubiquitylation Starostina et al. 2007 . Subsequently , poly-ubiquitylated TRA-1A is recognized by RPN-10 and delivered to the 20S proteasome . Interestingly , TRA-1A accumulated in worms in which UBXN-1 , UBXN-2 and UNXN-3 had been simultaneously knocked down , and the tra-1 e1099 mutation completely suppressed the FOG phenotype caused by the simultaneous knockdown of UBXN-1 , UBXN-2 and UNXN-3 . In addition , UBXN-1 , UBXN-2 and UNXN-3 bound K48-linked poly-ubiquitin chains . These results indicate that UBXN-1 , UBXN-2 and UNXN-3 positively regulate spermatogenesis via the degradation of TRA-1A , which inhibits spermatogenesis . The p97-UBXD7 complex promotes turnover of HIF1a , a substrate for the Cullin2-based ubiquitin ligase Alexandru et al. 2008 . Our data suggest that UBXN-1 , UBXN-2 and UNXN-3 promote the deg-radation of TRA-1A , a substrate for the CUL-2-based ubiquitin ligase . These results show the possibility that CDC-48 equipped UBXN-1 , UBXN-2 and UNXN-3 is recruited to the CUL-2 ubiquitin ligase . Interest-ingly , we found that UBXN-3 , a homologue of human UBXD7 , bound to the CDC-48-UFD-1-NPL-4 com-plex , suggesting that the binding of UBXN-3 and UFD-1-NPL-4 to CDC-48 is not mutually exclusive . Previous reports have showed that yeast Ubx2 and Ufd1-Npl4 cofactors bind to Cdc48p in the same com-plex and that Ubx2 further regulates the function of Cdc48p-Ufd1-Npl4 Neuber et al. 2005 Schuberth Buchberger 2005 . Furthermore , human SAKS1 , p47 and UBXD7 also bind to the p97-Ufd1-Npl4 complex Alexandru et al. 2008 . Therefore , the binding of UBX proteins and Ufd1-Npl4 to p97 ? CDC-48 is evo-lutionarily well conserved . p97 in conjunction with Ufd1-Npl4 has been found to be involved in several different ubiquitin-dependent processes and nuclear membrane reconstitution Bays et al. 2001 Hetzer et al. 2001 Rape et al. 2001 Ye et al. 2001 Braun et al. 2002 Jarosch et al. 2002 Rabinovich et al. 2002 Mouysset et al. 2006 Ramadan et al. 2007 Sasagawa et al. 2007c . UBX proteins can cooperate with the Ufd1-Npl4 cofactor on the same p97 hexamer . In C. elegans , the depletion of UFD-1 and NPL-4 resulted in embryonic lethality , whereas that of UBXN-3 did not . Even in the L1 feeding RNAi experiment , deple-tion of UFD-1 and NPL-4 resulted in the defective germ-line development Sasagawa et al. 2007c . UFD-1-NPL-4 is a well-known CDC-48 cofactor Mouysset et al. 2006 and is coprecipitated with CDC-48 very efficiently . These results indicate that UFD-1-NPL-4 plays crucial roles in CDC-48 function . Therefore , CDC-48-UFD-1-NPL-4 would be a core complex , and binding of one or some of UBXN proteins to this complex may diversify and specify the function of CDC-48 , or regulate the activity of the CDC-48-UFD-1-NPL-4 complex . Recently , we found that ELC-1 ? Elongin C , which is an adaptor of CUL-2 , interacts directly with NPL-4 but not with UFD-1 , UBXN-1 , UBXN-2 or UBXN-3 Sasagawa et al. 2009 . Human UBXN homologues also assemble with Cullin2 together with p97 and Ufd1-Npl4 Alexandru et al. 2008 . These results suggest that p97 ? CDC-48 and UBX ? UBXN cofactors are recruited to the Cul-lin2 ? CUL-2 ubiquitin ligase via interactions between ELC-1 ? Elongin C and NPL-4 ? Npl4 . How UBXN cofactors cooperate with the UFD-1-NPL-4 cofactor and how p97 ? CDC-48 complexes containing UBXN cofactors cooperate with E3 ligases , however , remain to be addressed . Experimental procedures Caenorhabditis elegans strains and general methods In this study , we used C. elegans N2 wild-type worms and the mutant strains FX2759 ubxn-1 tm2759 , VC1450 ubxn-2 ok1942 IV ? nT1 [ qIs51 ] , CB3844 fem-3 e2006lf , CB2590 tra-1 e1099 ? dpy-18 e1096 , HT1593 unc-119 ed3 , XA7200 unc-119 ed3 qaIs7200 [ unc-119 + ] and XA7203 unc-119 ed3 cdc-48.1 tm544 qaIs7201 [ Pcdc-48.1-FLAG CDC-48.1 , unc - 119 + ] .

The DNA sequences encoding a FLAG tag were inserted immediately upstream of the translation termi-nation codon of npl-4.1 to produce a C-terminal fusion protein . The XA7205 unc-119 ed3 qaIs7202 [ Pnpl-4.1-NPL-4.1 FLAG , unc-119 + ] strain expressing NPL-4.1 FLAG protein was created using microparticle bombardment Praitis et al. 2001 .

Finally , precipitants were extracted with 100 lL of IP buffer containing 1 mg ? mL of FLAG peptide Sigma as a competitor and analyzed with SDS-PAGE . RNA interference RNAi experiments To construct RNAi plasmids , full-length cDNA fragments of ubxn-1 , ubxn-2 , ubxn-3 , ubxn-4 , ubxn-5 and ubxn-6 were cloned into the pLITMUS28 plasmid New England BioLabs . Subsequently , we amplified each dsDNA from the resulting plasmids using the following primers L28Fw2442to2466 5¢-AGCTACGTAATACGACTCACTAGTG-3¢ forward and L28Rv2603to2627 5¢-CAGTCCGTAATACGACTCACTTA AG-3¢ reverse . The resulting dsDNA fragments , which con-tained the T7 promoter at both ends , were used as a template for in vitro dsRNA synthesis . The dsRNAs were synthesized in vitro with T7 RNA polymerase and purified . Finally , each dsRNA approximately 0.2 mg ? mL was microinjected into the body cavity of C. elegans hermaphrodites at the young adult stage . However , we knocked down cdc-48.1 , cdc-48.2 , ufd-1 and rpn-10 using the optimal feeding RNAi method Kamath et al. 2001 with RNAi plasmids Shimada et al. 2006 Sasagawa et al. 2007b , c . The RNAi construct for rpn-10 was a kind gift from Dr. H. Kawahara Shimada et al. 2006 . Antibody production and immunofluorescence Antibodies against full-length UBXN-1 , UBXN-2 , UBXN-3 and UFD-1 were generated . PCR-amplified full-length cDNA fragments of ubxn-1 , ubxn-2 , ubxn-3 and ufd-1 were cloned into the expression vector pCold I TaKaRa to make an N-terminal His6-tagged construct . The resulting plasmids were used to transform E. coli BL21 DE3 harboring the pG-Tf2 chaperone vector TaKaRa , and recombinant proteins were overproduced at 15 ? C and purified .

21050342	Introduction Human embryonic stem cells hESCs are a potential source of cardiomyocytes for future heart therapy . The hESCs might also represent a valuable model for studying early embryonic cardiac development because they proliferate indefinitely in an undifferen-tiated state and potentially have the ability to differen-tiate into all types of cardiac cells , including atrial , Communicated by Hideyuki Okano and the rapid proliferation of cardiomyocytes Martin-Puig et al. 2008 . Therefore , the induction of anterior PS formation is a key step for mimicking cardiac development in hESCs . Although multiple signaling pathways are involved in PS formation Rossant Tam 2004 Gadue et al. 2005 , Wnt ? b-catenin signal-ing plays a central role in the development of the mesoderm Lickert et al. 2002 Tam Loebel 2007 . During heart development , cardiac progenitors are exposed to various signaling molecules , including bone morphogenic proteins BMPs Schultheiss et al. 1997 , fibroblast growth factors FGFs Alsan Schultheiss 2002 and Wnt antagonists Schneider Mercola 2001 , to lead to the differentiation into cardiomyocytes . The coordination of events by these signaling pathways is important for the effective gener-ation of functional cardiomyocytes in the embryo . As suggested by previous studies , a possible approach for generating functional cells including cardiomyocytes from hESCs is to reproduce the key events that regulate embryogenesis Murry Keller 2008 . Embryoid body EB formation Kehat et al . report the cardiac potential of these anterior PS cells derived from hESCs . 2001 Xu et al. 2002 He et al. 2003 Satin et al . 2004 Laflamme et al. 2005 and co-cultivation with feeder cells Mummery et al. 2003 have been reported as effective methods for inducing cardio-myocyte differentiation from hESCs . The role of the signaling pathway s involved in the specification of cardiomyocytes from hESCs is largely unknown for any of these methods . It has been shown that Wnt3a or BMP4 alone can induce cardiomyocyte differentia-tion during EB formation Takei et al. 2009 Tran et al. 2009 , but the combined effects of Wnt3a and BMP4 with regard to cardiomyocyte differentiation remain largely undetermined . A recent study demon-strated that the combination of BMP4 , FGF2 , Activin A , vascular endothelial growth factor VEGF and dickkopf homologue 1 DKK1 induced the forma-tion of cardiomyocytes from hESCs Yang et al. 2008 . However , this result leads us to speculate that these cardiomyocytes developed through the forma-tion of the posterior PS , in which BMP signaling is significantly involved . The stepwise process that mimics the cardiac developmental environment via anterior PS formation has yet to be established in hESCs . We previously demonstrated that activation of the canonical Wnt ? b-catenin signaling pathway induced the differentiation of hESCs toward the nascent PS . Furthermore , the simultaneous blockage of BMP signaling by Noggin guided the cell fate toward ante-rior PS progenitors Sumi et al. 2008 . We herein Differentiation into cardiomyocytes from hESCs through anterior PS formation Cardiomyocytes are derived from the mesoderm that migrates through a mid-to-anterior region of the PS during embryogenesis . A successful strategy to obtain functional cardiomyocytes from hESCs would mimic the in vivo embryonic differentiation process . We pre-viously established stable hESC lines constitutively expressing a fusion protein of stabilized b-catenin by the deletion of the glycogen synthase kinase GSK 3 phosphorylation sites and a mutant ligand-binding domain of the estrogen receptor ER Sumi et al. 2008 . This fusion protein is conditionally and revers-ibly activated in response to the ER agonist 4-hydroxy-tamoxifen 4OHT . We observed that b-catenin activation in hESCs resulted in the differen-tiation of the hESCs into PS populations on the induction of BMP signaling . Furthermore , simulta-neous blockage of BMP signaling by Noggin directed the cell fate toward cells with similar properties of the anterior PS in their gene expression behavior Sumi et al. 2008 . In this study , to examine the cardiac differentiation potential of the b-catenin-activated cells with Noggin hereafter referred to as anterior PS cells , we designed a protocol for differentiation of these cells toward a cardiac lineage Fig. 1A . Because the treatment of hESCs for 3 days with 4OHT and Noggin was sufficient to induce the development of anterior PS cells in the previous study , we initially assumed the optimum period of b-catenin activation with Noggin was between 2 and 4 days stage I . After treatment with 4OHT and Noggin for 2–4 days , the cells were dissociated into single cells and cultured in the presence of BMP4 and FGF2 for a further 12 days in low-attachment 96-well plates stage II , 96-well culture method . Because 4OHT treatment through-out stage I reduced the efficiency of cardiomyocyte induction , the cells were cultured with 4OHT and Noggin for first 24 h , and then with only Noggin for additional 1–3 days . Under these conditions , the dissociated cells spontaneously formed aggregates of uniform size , and contracting cells were observed on the surface of the aggregates derived from day 3 and day 4 anterior PS cells Fig. 1D . The frequency of the aggregates containing contracting cells relative to the number of all aggregates observed was indicated as A B D E F the percentage of beating aggregates Fig. 1B . Approximately 30 % of the beating aggregates derived from the day 3 anterior PS cells were observed at day 6 of stage II , and the frequency of beating aggregates reached nearly 90 % at day 12 of stage II . Remarkably , almost all of the day 4 anterior PS cell-derived aggre-gates developed contracting cells at day 6 of stage II . However , no contracting cells were observed in the day 2 anterior PS cell-derived aggregates . We subsequently examined a proportion of cardio-myocytes from these three conditions Fig. 1C . The aggregates cultured under each condition were col-lected randomly at day 12 of stage II and dissociated into single cells before seeding on glass plates for immunostaining . The number of cells stained with anti-a-actinin antibody was counted as a cardiomyo-cyte population . The day 2 anterior PS cell-derived aggregates developed only a small number of a-actinin-positive cardiomyocytes , which was consis-tent with the absence of contracting cells shown in Fig. 1B . The aggregates generated from the day 3 ante-rior PS cells contained 10 % cardiomyocytes , whereas the day 4 anterior PS cell-derived aggregates contained over 20 % cardiomyocytes . These results suggest that the cells with the potential to differentiate into cardiomyo-cytes appeared from day 3 after the activation of b-catenin with Noggin and that the population com-mitted to the cardiac lineage increased between days 3 and 4 . Thereafter , we primarily analyzed cells treated with 4OHT and Noggin for 4 days to obtain a higher number of cardiomyocytes . The emergence of contracting cells in the aggre-gates was first detected on day 8 , and nearly all of the aggregates had developed contracting cells by day 9 Fig. 1D , E . Cell contractions continued for at least 26 days of observation Fig. 1D , Video S1 in Supporting Information . The proportion of cardio-myocytes in the aggregates was subsequently examined in different culture stages Fig. 1F . Approximately 10 % of the cells were a-actinin-positive in the day 10 aggregates , and the number of cells increased approxi-mately threefold by day 26 . In another cell line derived from KhES-1 cells K1DNb-cateninER , all of the aggregates developed contracting cells using a similar 96-well culture method , although the aggregates only generated 10 % cardiomyocytes Fig. S1A , B , G in Sup-porting Information . These observations revealed that hESC lines display variations in their propensity for cardiomyocyte differentiation , as demonstrated previously Osafune et al. 2008 . To evaluate the effect of the concentrations of BMP4 and FGF2 at stage II on the development of cardiomyocytes , the b-catenin-induced cells with Noggin were cultured with different concentrations of BMP4 and FGF2 for a further 12 days at stage II Fig. S2 in Supporting Information . No contracting cells and few a-actinin-positive cardiomyocytes were observed in the aggregates cultured with FGF2 alone or without both BMP4 and FGF2 at stage II . Although contracting cells and a-actinin-positive cells were observed in the aggregates when cultured with BMP4 alone , the aggregates containing cardiomyo-cytes appeared to show poor growth without FGF2 Fig. S2C in Supporting Information . These results indicated that the combined action of BMP4 and FGF2 is required for the effective induction and expansion of cardiomyocytes from hESCs . To obtain the highest number of cardiomyocytes , all experiments were carried out with the same concentrations of 10 ng ? ml BMP4 and 5 ng ? ml FGF . Characterization of the aggregates developing into a cardiac lineage We subsequently investigated the developmental changes in gene expression related to cardiac differenti-ation by RT-PCR analysis Fig. 1G , Fig. S1C in Supporting Information . The expression of POU5F1 , a pluripotent maker gene , was low after day 6 . The expression of T increased at day 4 and disappeared immediately after the addition of BMP4 and FGF2 . Although KDR was expressed in undifferentiated ESCs , the level of expression increased from day 6 and persisted until day 16 . The expression of transcription factor genes associated with cardiac development Olson 2006 , such as TBX5 , MEF2C , ISL1 and NKX2-5 , were up-regulated until day 6 , suggesting that further differentiation into cardiomyocytes was induced immediately after the addition of BMP4 and FGF2 . Increased expression of MYH6 and TNNT2 , which are cardiomyocyte-specific genes , was also detected on day 6 , whereas ACTN2 expression increased between days 6–8 . The expression of genes related to vascular smooth muscle ACTA2 and MYH11 and endothelial devel-opment CDH5 and PECAM1 also increased during cardiac differentiation . An immunostaining analysis revealed the co-expression of Nkx2-5 , a cardiac transcription factor , and a-actinin proteins in aggregates containing contracting cells Fig. 1H , I , thus showing that the a-actinin-positive cells observed in this study were cardiomyocytes and not skeletal muscle . The co-expression of a-actinin and troponin T proteins was also detected in the aggregates , along with cells express-ing SM-MHC , SM-actin or CD31 Fig. 1J–L , Fig. S1D in Supporting Information . The results of the RNA and protein analyses suggested that the b-catenin-activated cells contained not only cardiac but also vascular smooth muscle and endothelial potential . We analyzed the cardiac potential of b-catenin-activated cells induced without Noggin using the same protocol shown in Fig. 1A . Unlike cells treated with 4OHT and Noggin , only 10 % of beating aggregates were observed when treated with 4OHT alone Fig. 2A , Fig. S1E in Supporting Information . This result was consistent with immunostaining results in which very few a-actinin-positive cells were detected in aggregates derived from cells induced with 4OHT only , whereas a-actinin-positive cells were clearly observed in aggregates derived from the 4OHT-and Noggin-treated cells Fig. 2B , Fig. S1F in Supporting Information . We next examined the expression of cardiac genes such as TBX5 , NKX2-5 , MYH6 and ACTN2 by a quantitative RT-PCR analysis . Because the expression of the TBX5 gene reached the highest level on day 8 of culture as shown in Fig. 1G , TBX5 expression was investigated on day 8 of culture . The expression of the other genes including NKX2-5 , MYH6 and ACTN2 was examined at day 16 when cardiomyocyte forma-tion became evident . The results revealed that the expression of all cardiac genes analyzed was down-regulated in the 4OHT-only condition compared to the cells treated with 4OHT and Noggin Fig. 2C . To further confirm the importance of BMP inhibi-tion by Noggin for cardiomyocyte induction , we ana-lyzed the cardiac potential of cells treated with 4OHT in the presence of BMP4 . No beating cells or a-actinin-positive cardiomyocytes were observed in the BMP4-treated cultures Fig. 2A , B . A quantitative RT-PCR analysis showed that the cardiac gene expression was decreased to a similar extent as in the 4OHT-only treated cells . Thus , the cardiac potential was markedly different between the b-catenin-activated populations in the absence or presence of Noggin . These findings support that the blockage of BMP signaling at stage I is crucial for specifying prospective cardiac progenitors , through the forma-tion of the PS induced by b-catenin , suggesting that cardiomyocytes develop from cells that migrate through the anterior region of the PS . The culture method for cardiomyocyte induction using a 96-well plate easily facilitated tracing the kinetics of cardiomyocyte development in each uni-formly sized aggregate . It was not possible to prepare cardiomyocytes with a higher purity and larger scale for detailed functional analysis or therapeutic applica-tions . To address this problem , we devised another strategy to obtain a greater number of purified cardio-myocytes Fig. 3A . After treatment with 4OHT and Noggin at stage I , the cells were dissociated into sin-gle cells and cultured in a low-attachment plate with BMP4 and FGF2 Fig. 3B . The dissociated cells spontaneously formed various sizes of cell masses and developed contracting cell clumps on the surface of each mass Fig. 3C . Because the beating clumps could be separated from large vesicles by brief pipett-ing Fig. 3C , D , the small clumps cardiac aggregates could be collected through a 70-lm cell strainer . After suspension for at least 3 months in a medium E J I We examined whether cardiomyocytes could be induced in genetically unmanipulated hESCs using a GSK3 inhibitor , CHIR99021 Cline et al. 2002 Bain et al. 2007 . After treatment with CHIR99021 and Noggin for 5 days , cells were dissociated , and single cells were cultured in a medium containing BMP4 and FGF2 Fig. 4A . The cells spontaneously formed aggre-gates as is the case of the DNb-cateninER cells . A kinetic analysis of the 96-well culture method revealed contracting cells in 20 % of aggregates beating from day 9 , and all aggregates were contracting at day 10 Fig. 4B , F and Video S3 in Supporting Information . Nearly 20 % of the cells were a-actinin-positive in the aggregates by day 17 Fig . 4G . Immunostaining analy-sis showed co-expression of Nkx2-5 and a-actinin Because cardiomyocytes arise from a distinct mid-to-anterior region , of the PS , inducing the specific portion of the PS from hESCs would be effective for the generation of the cardiomyocytes in vitro . Canoni-cal Wnt ? b-catenin signaling plays a central role in the formation of the PS , whereas the suppression of BMP signaling during the PS formation is involved in cell fate specification of the anterior populations of the PS Tam Loebel 2007 . In this study , we showed that the anterior , but not posterior , PS populations induced by b-catenin activation with Noggin exhibited abun-dant cardiac potential in hESCs . This indicates that the combined manipulations of the canonical Wnt ? b-catenin and BMP signaling pathways are effective for the generation of cardiomyocytes via the anterior PS formation from the hESCs . The effects of both signaling pathways in cardiac development have been supported by in vitro studies using mouse ESCs . These studies demonstrated that the synergistic activation of the canonical Wnt ? b-catenin pathway and inhibition of BMP signaling enhanced cardiac gene expression in vitro Lindsley et al. 2006 furthermore , the tran-sient blockage of BMP signaling by Noggin resulted in effective induction of cardiomyocytes Yuasa et al. 2005 . Other BMP antagonists , including Gremlin and Dorsomorphin , were recently reported to promote cardiomyogenesis in mouse ESCs Hao et al. 2008 Kami et al. 2008 . These studies support our observa-tions that the inhibition of BMP signaling is involved et al. 2010 . The addition of the Wnt protein that activates the Wnt ? b-catenin pathway was thereby expected to replicate the effect of the GSK3 inhibitor in this study . Surprisingly , the cells treated with recombinant Wnt3a protein did not form aggregates at stage II , resulting in a failure to induce cardiomyocytes data not shown . In general , Wnt3a activates Wnt ? b-catenin signaling , leading to accumulation of b-cate-nin protein in the nuclei , where its target genes were activated Willert Jones 2006 MacDonald et al. 2009 . In the cells treated with 4OHT or a GSK3 inhibitor , the expression of b-catenin in the nuclei was clearly observed , whereas in the cells treated with Wnt3a , b-catenin remained to be localized at the cell membrane of almost all of the cells data not shown . These results indicate that the effect of Wnt3a on b-catenin activation is not the same as those of a GSK3 inhibitor under our culture conditions . The duration of CHIR99021 treatment at stage I was critical to obtain sufficient numbers of cardio-myocytes from unmanipulated hESCs . The cells trea-ted with CHIR99021 and Noggin for 4 days only generated 3 % cardiomyocytes data not shown . This result demonstrates that the efficiency of cardiomyo-cyte production was dramatically changed between 4 and 5 days , suggesting that the population committed to the cardiac lineage increased between days 4 and 5 . Meanwhile , the culture period for the cardiac spec-ification was different between unmanipulated hESCs 5 days and DNb-cateninER cells 4 days . These differences might be because of the constitutive expression of stabilized b-catenin-ER , which could allow faster accumulation of b-catenin in the nucleus after 4OHT exposure than would occur in the unma-nipulated hESCs using a GSK3 inhibitor . In this report , we established a novel stepwise devel-opmental method for differentiation of hESCs into a cardiac lineage by the synergistic actions of Wnt ? b-catenin and Noggin , followed by BMP4 and FGF2 . Given that this culture strategy allows tracing of the cardiac embryonic developmental process in the hESCs and production of functional cardiomycoytes by a process mimicking the in vivo process , it will provide valuable opportunities to address some of the important issues about cardiac development . For example , this method can be used to assess how cellular and molecu-lar mechanisms endow the cells with the cardiac lineage fate through the PS formation . Furthermore , this approach will also be useful in the field of chemi-cal screening for small molecules on cardiomyocyte differentiation , and also for the pharmacological testing for drug-induced long QT syndrome . Experimental procedures Maintenance and differentiation of hESCs The use of hES cell lines was conducted in accordance with ‘The Guidelines for Derivation and Utilization of Human Embryonic Stem Cells 2001 ’ of the Ministry of Education , Culture , Sports , Science and Technology , Japan , after approval of the Institutional Review Board . The hESC lines , KhES-1 and KhES-3 , which constitutively expressed a fusion protein of stabilized b-catenin and a mutant ligand-binding domain of the ER , were obtained and maintained as described previously Suemori et al. 2006 Sumi et al. 2008 . For the differentiation of hESCs , the cells were dissociated into small clumps and cultured on dishes coated with matrigel BD Biosciences , San Jose , CA , USA in mouse embryonic fibroblast MEF -condi-tioned medium with 5 ng ? mL recombinant human FGF2 Wako Pure Chemical Industries Ltd , Osaka , Japan . From the next day referred to as day 0 of culture , the cells were cul-tured in N2B27 medium with 100 nM 4OHT Sigma-Aldrich , St Louis , MO , USA , 10 ng ? mL recombinant human BMP4 R D Systems , Minneapolis , MN , USA and ? or 100 ng ? ml recombinant human Noggin ? Fc Chimera R D Systems Sumi et al. 2008 . In the case of KhES-3 cells , after 4OHT treatment with BMP4 or Noggin for the first 24 h , the 4OHT was washed out of the cells with DMEM ? F12 supplemented with N2B27 , and thereafter the cells were trea-ted with BMP4 or Noggin only until the end of culturing at stage I . In the case of KhES-1 cells , the cells were treated with 4OHT and Noggin throughout all 4 days of culture at stage I . The medium was changed every day . For the genera-tion of aggregates at stage II , cells treated with 4OHT were trypsinized , seeded at a density of 10,000 cells per well in a Celltight Spheroid 96-well round bottom plate Sumitomo Bakelite Co. Ltd , Tokyo , Japan and cultured in RPMI1640 medium Invitrogen supplemented with fetal bovine serum 0.5 % FBS , L-glutamine 2 mM , L-ascorbic acid 2 mM , nicotinamide 10 mM , dexamethasone 0.1 lM , 1 · Insulin-Transferrin-Selenium-G supplement Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA , USA , sodium pyruvate 1 mM , BMP4 10 ng ? mL and FGF2 5 ng ? mL . For differentiation of an unmanipulated ESC line KhES-3 , CHIR99021 Stemgent , San Diego , CA , USA was used at a final concentration of 6 lM with 100 ng ? mL Noggin for the first 5 days of stage I . Thereafter , the CHIR99021-treated cells were differentiated into a cardiac lineage under the same culture conditions as those described earlier . Isolation of cardiac aggregates For isolation of cardiac aggregates , the 4OHT-or CHIR99021-treated cells were trypsinized and cultured for an additional 8 days in a 6-well ultra-low-attachment plate Corning , Lowell , MA , USA in the same medium that was used for the aggregate culture as shown earlier at a density of 1 · 106 cells per well . Cell aggregates in the population , which were approximately 70 lm and greater in size , were collected by passing them through a 70-lm cell strainer Becton , Dickinson and Company , Franklin Lakes , NJ , USA . Cardiac aggregates were separated from the noncardiac aggregates by brief pipetting and were collected through a new 70-lm cell strainer . These cells were subsequently cultured with the same medium for stage II . For immunostaining analysis , the cardiac aggregates were seeded on glass chamber plates and fixed in 4 % paraformaldehyde PFA for 15 min the next day . Total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Micro Kit QIA-GEN , Valencia , VA , USA and reverse-transcribed using the Omniscript RT Kit QIAGEN according to the manufacturer’s instructions . Semi-quantitative RT-PCR was carried out using Ex-Taq Polymerase Takara Biotechnology , Tokyo , Japan . Quantitative RT-PCR was carried out using SYBR Green RT-PCR reagents Applied Biosystems , Foster City , CA , USA and an ABI PRISM 7500 Sequence Detection System Applied Biosystems according to the manufacturer’s protocols . The relative amount of each gene was normalized against GAPDH using the comparative threshold cycle CT method . The data represent the means ± standard deviation from three independent experiments . The expression level of each gene in the 4OHT-only treated samples was defined as 1.0 . Details of the primers used for the semi-quantitative and quantitative RT-PCR are shown in Table S1 in Supporting Information . Immunofluorescence analysis Aggregates were fixed in 4 % PFA for 1 h on ice , washed in PBS and soaked in 15 % sucrose for 1 h on ice . After being embedded in O.C.T. compound Sakura Finetek USA Inc. , Torrance , CA , USA , samples were sectioned at a thickness of 7 lm . To count the number of cardiomyocytes in the aggre-gates , the aggregates were treated with 1 mg ? ml collagenase Invitrogen in DMEM ? F12 for 1 h and then incubated in TrypLE Select Invitrogen for 10 min with gentle shaking in a 37 °C , 5 % CO2 incubator . The dissociated cells were cultured on glass bottom dishes for 24 h , then fixed in 4 % PFA for 15 min . Immunostaining was carried out as described previously Yamauchi et al. 2009 . Fluorescence was observed using a Zeiss fluorescence microscope Carl Zeiss , Vertrieb , Deutschland . The following primary antibodies were used for the immunofluorescence analysis rabbit anti-Nkx2-5 H-114 , 1 50 Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Inc . Santa Cruz , CA , USA , mouse anti-a-actinin EA-53 , 1 800 Sigma-Aldrich , mouse anti-heavy chain cardiac myosin MHC , 1 200 Abcam , Cambridge , UK , mouse anti-cardiac troponinT 1 100 Abcam , mouse anti-smooth muscle actin SM-actin , 1 200 Sigma-Aldrich , mouse anti-smooth muscle myosin heavy chain SM-MHC , 1 200 Dako , Glostrup , Denmark , mouse anti-CD31 1 100 R D Systems , mouse anti-VE-cadherin 1 100 R D Systems , rabbit anti-connexin43 1 50 Cell Signaling Tech-nology Inc. , Danvers , MA and rabbit anti-HCN4 1 50 Alamone Labs Ltd , Jerusalem , Israel . AlexaFluor 488 - , 546 - , 555-or 647-conjugated secondary antibodies were purchased from Invitrogen . For whole-cell patch-clamp recording , cardiac aggregates on days 95–103 of culture were dissociated into single cells using the same protocol described earlier and cultured for 4–7 days on matrigel-or gelatin-coated cover glasses Matsunami Glass Ind. Ltd , Osaka , Japan . Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were carried out using a HEKA EPC10 amplifier HEKA Instruments Inc. , Bellmore , NY , USA . The external solution contained 140 mM NaCl , 5 mM KCl , 10 mM HEPES , 2 mM CaCl2 , 1 mM MgCl2 and 10 mM glucose and was adjusted to pH 7.2 with NaOH . The pipette solution contained 80 mM K-aspartate , 50 mM KCl , 1 mM MgCl2 , 10 mM EGTA , 3 mM ATP-Mg and 10 mM HEPES and was adjusted to pH 7.2 with KOH . The current–voltage relationship was obtained by holding the membrane potential at 40 to 90 mV and then delivering a depolarizing pulse for 500 ms in a stepwise manner with 10 mV increments from 50 to 140 mV for HCN currents known as If in the heart . The cardiac aggregates on day 38–49 of culture , and undiffer-entiated ESCs , were injected directly into the testes of SCID mice . For the immunostaining analysis , testes were collected at 8 weeks after the surgery and fixed in 4 % PFA for 3 h at 4 °C , washed three times in PBS and soaked in 30 % sucrose-PBS for 24 h at 4 °C . Thereafter , the tissues were immersed in a 1 1 mixture of 30 % sucrose and OCT for 2 h at room temperature and were embedded in OCT . The sam-ples were sectioned at a thickness of 7 lm , and an immuno-staining analysis was carried out . To detect transplanted hES cell-derived cardiomyocytes in the mice , the following primary antibodies were used mouse anti-a-actinin or mouse anti-human nuclei antibody 1 400 Millipore , Billerica , MA , USA . For the immunostaining analysis , testes were collected at 8 weeks after the surgery . Statistical significance was evaluated by Student’s t-test . The number of aggregates that contained contracting cells relative to the total number of aggregates n 96 is shown as the per-centage of beating aggregates . The number of a-actinin-posi-tive cells relative to the total number of nuclei n 1000 stained with DAPI is indicated as the percentage of a-actinin-positive cells . All values on the graphs are presented as the means ± standard error of the mean SEM of three indepen-dent experiments .

21083635	night and early morning Fujii et al. 2007 . Such mat-ing rhythm is called close-proximity CP rhythm . Assays of CP have shown that circadian clocks regu-late male courtship behavior in a circadian manner . Furthermore , they showed that the core component of circadian clock , per , is regulated for the generation of CP rhythms . However , the circadian clock neu-rons driving rhythms in CP behavior have not been identified . In this study , we aimed at identifying the clock neurons that control CP rhythms in D. melanogaster . Although the dynamics of the CP rhythms are dis-tinct from the locomotor activity of single fly Fujii et al. 2007 , we assumed that either or both M cells and E cells are involved in CP behavior . Thus , we combined M-cell-and ? or E-cell-specific GAL4 ? GAL80 lines with UAS-hid , a programmed cell death gene , to determine whether M cells and ? or E cells contribute to CP rhythms . We found that E cells are involved in the CP rhythms . Immunocytochemical studies showed that a small population of E cells , in particular , is crucial for the normal CP rhythms . Results For sexually reproducing animals , a complex sequence of mating behavior is required to propagate healthy offspring . Based on this notion , sexual behavior including the courtship behavior of D. melanogaster has been studied as an obvious candidate for involvement in the temporal separation of subpopulations during the speciation process Sakai Ishida 2001 Miyatake et al. 2002 Tauber et al. 2003 Rogers et al. 2004 Nishinokubi et al. 2006 . If so between Drosophila species , the dynamics of the CP rhythm might be conserved among the wild-type strains of D. melanog-aster . To extend our knowledge about the timing of the courtship behavior in D. melanogaster , we applied CP assay to three wild-type strains of D. melanogaster , OGS-4 , 1619 and Canton-S strains . We monitored CP in wild-type D. melanogaster Oregon-R under DD , subsequent to a light and dark LD12 12 cycle . The CP rhythms of heterosexual pairs of Oregon-R flies dipped at dusk under LD12 12 . The rhythmic profile of CP persisted under DD with dip at the time of subjective lights-off CT12 Fig. 1A . The circadian rhythmicity of CP under DD was statisti-cally significant according to autocorrelation analysis 24.0 ± 0.75 h . The other wild types also showed a close-proximity rhythm similar to that in Oregon-R , although the strength of rhythmicity in all three strains was not as distinct as that of Oregon-R . This observa-tion supports the notion that the dynamics of the CP Role of E cells for CP rhythm in Drosophila brain cry-GAL4 line is specific to the LNvs , LNds and some DN1s Stoleru et al. 2004 . First , we used the pairs of the cry-GAL4 ? UAS-hid flies referred as cry hid below to see whether these subgroups of clocks are involved in the CP rhythm . The initial controls were fly pairs with only the UAS-hid transgene +hid . The CP rhythms in +hid pairs under both LD12 12 and DD were robust and similar to those of Oregon-R pairs Fig. 2A . We then ablated only M cells in the pairs of pdf-GAL4 ? UAS-hid flies Fig. 2B because M cells predominate over E cells with respect to activity rhythms under DD Renn et al. 1999 . The clear circadian CP rhythm suggested that M cells are not crucial for the CP rhythms . Dippes in CP behavior at subjective dusk in pdf-GAL4 ? UAS-hid flies were slightly impaired under DD , suggesting that M cells control the amplitude of CP rhythms or synchroniza-tion of CP rhythms between each pairs . However , CP was low in the pairs of cry-GAL4 ? UAS-hid referred to as cry hid below flies in which M cells and E cells were ablated . The frequency of CP was consis-tently low under both LD and DD , CP behavior under light was attenuated , and the dippes at dusk were not prominent under either LD or DD Fig. 2C . These results suggested that E cells are more important for CP behavior . However , autocorrelation analysis detected circadian rhythmicity in the CP behavior of cry-GAL4 ? UAS-hid flies under DD . Indeed a slight increase in CP behavior was at dawn , suggesting that the residual rhythm in CP behavior is controlled by clock neurons other than the M cells and E cells . To clarify whether E cells are important for CP rhythms , we examined CP behavior in cry-GAL4 ? pdf-GAL80 ? UAS-hid flies [ cry -pdf hid ] in which M cells escaped targeted cell death ablated E cells with intact M cells Stoleru et al. 2004 . CP behavior in the cry -pdf hid pairs was totally arrhythmic under both LD and DD . These results suggest that E cells are responsible for distinct CP rhythms , whereas M cells are rather supportive . To further understand the molecular clock func-tion of M cells and E cells in generating CP rhythms , we rendered the circadian function of these neurons defective by expressing a dominant-negative type of positive transcription factor , CYCD Tanoue et al. 2004 . When CYCD expression was limited in M cells by pdf-GAL4 pdf CYCD , CP behavior B C D remained rhythmic , but the dippes of CP behavior were impaired similar to pdf hid flies Fig. 3A , B . CYCD expression in M cells and E cells by cry-GAL4 cry CYCD decreased CP behavior . Although dip-pes of CP behavior are slightly remained at dusk , the CP rhythms were weak Fig. 3C . When CYCD expression was limited in E cells by cry-GAL4 ? pdf-GAL80 cry -pdf CYCD , the CP rhythms were severely impaired , like as the flies that E cells were ablated . It should note that the CP rhythms slightly A B C D E dipped at dawn in cry -pdf CYCD , which were detected as a component with 12-h period by auto-correlation analysis Fig. 3D . CYCD was expressed in all clock neurons by tim-GAL4 , and CP behavior was completely arrhythmic Fig. 3E . In all genotypes , CYCD expression resulted in rather weak phenotype compared to hid expression . Identification of clock neurons involved in CP rhythm generation An immunocytochemical approach with anti-PDF and anti-CLK antisera confirmed M-and E-cell abla-tion Houl et al. 2006 . All neurons in pdf hid flies were PDF immunonegative , whereas other clock neurons , such as LNds , PDF-negative s-LNv 5th-s-LNv and DNs remained intact Fig. 4B . None of the LNs in cry hid flies were detected using anti-CLK antiserum . In addition to these neurons , five dorsal neurons DN1 were ablated in cry hid flies Fig. 4C , and as in these flies , LNds , 5th-s-LNv and five DN1 cells were ablated in the cry -pdf hid flies . Although both l-LNvs and s-LNvs should have been rescued in the cry -pdf hid flies , only s-LNvs were detectable Fig. 4D . These observations suggest that at least LNds , PDF-negative s-LNv and five DN1s involve cells for generating the normal CP rhythm . Our immunocytochemical observation was essentially similar to the GFP expression studies reported by Stoleru et al. 2004 , but the number of DN1 in the cry hid flies was different . Also we could see that l-LNv cells are not rescued in the cry -pdf hid flies , which is unexpected from GFP expression studies Stoleru et al. 2004 . An explana-tion for the discrepancy between GFP expression and targeted cell death might be that some GFP-positive neurons are involved in the development of other clock neurons . Differences on the CP rhythm pheno-type between hid expression and CYCD would in part arise from these mistargeted cell death . Neuropeptide-F , homologous to mammalian neuro-peptide-Y , is expressed in the brain neurons including three LNd cells Lee et al. 2006 . To test whether these three npf-positive LNds are involved in the CP rhythm , we measured CP rhythms in npf-GAL4 ? UAS-hid flies npf hid . Interestingly , CP rhythms in the npf hid did not differ from those of control flies with only the npf-GAL4 transgene npf+ Fig. 5A , B . Furthermore , we measured CP rhythms among pairs of flies in which UAS-hid was changed into UAS-CYCD npf CYCD . The CP rhythms of the A B C D npf CYCD pairs were similar to those of the control Fig. 5C . We assayed the efficiency of npf hid-induced ablation by immunocytochemistry using anti-CLK and anti-PDF antisera . Three of six LNds were ablated in the npf hid flies as predicted from other studies , although ablation of 5th-s-LNvs was not obvious Fig. 5D . However , other clock neurons , including DN1s , remained intact in the npf hid pairs . This suggests that the three npf-positive LNds at least are not required for the CP rhythms . Although ablation of npf-positive cells alters the latency of courtship behavior Lee et al. 2006 , CP rhythm was not under the control of npf-positive clocks . E Discussion The neuronal processing that coordinates sensory inputs with the appropriate motor output responses is one of the most challenging aspects within the fields of studying courtship as well as circadian be-havior Helfrich-Forster ¨ 2003 Billeter et al. 2006 . Recent studies have characterized the major clock neurons in the brain of Drosophila as M cells and E cells that regulate locomotor activities at dawn and at dusk , respectively , under LD conditions . M cells predominate over E cells with respect to the locomo-tor rhythms in DD Renn et al. 1999 . The present study showed that E cells three npf-negative LNds , five DN1s and possibly 5th-s-LNv and M cells include cells essential for the CP rhythm . Both E cells and M cells are involved in the CP rhythms , but these cells contribute to the CP rhythm differently . When E cells were abrated , the CP rhythms were impaired under LD as well as under DD , suggesting that E cells are essential for output of the CP rhythms . However , when M cells sLNvs and lLNvs were absent or dysfunctional , the CP rhythms sustained under LD and were gently dampening under DD , suggesting that M cells help E cells with maintaining the rhythms and ? or synchronizing the phase under DD . Signaling from LNvs to E cells is possibly mediated by neuropeptide PDF which are necessary for the maintenance of robust rhythms in some DN1s , CRY-positive LNds and DN2s Renn et al. 1999 Yoshii et al. 2009 . Taken together , we propose a model that E cells three npf-negative LNds , five DN1s and possibly 5th-s-LNv include cells essential for the generation of the CP rhythms , whereas M cells possibly lLNvs support the amplitude of clock oscillation of E cells . In cry -pdf hid flies , puzzlingly , sLNvs eliminated the residual CP rhythms that were shown in cry hid flies . This might be explained the fact that some of the cry-GAL4-negative DNs oscillate with antiphase in the presence of PDF or dampen the clock oscilla-tion in the absence of PDF Yoshii et al. 2009 . While we were preparing this manuscript , a simi-lar report was published by Fujii Amrein 2010 . Their findings are largely along with our observa-tions that some DN1s and in particular LNvs are essential for the CP rhythms . Considering their observations , the present study suggests the possibil-ity that M cells could affect the CP rhythms by way of E cells . However , the CP rhythms sustained without LNvs at least for a couple of days under DD , suggesting that E cells as the primary determi-nant of rhythmic motivation for Drosophila courtship behavior . Interestingly , some E cells , which is 2 npf-positive LNds , a NPF-negative LNds and 5th-s-LNv , are sufficient to drive the locomotor rhythms without LNvs under a certain light condition Rie-ger et al. 2009 . Rieger et al. 2009 propose a notion that M cells and E cells act differently depending on the environmental conditions . Simi-larly , we assume that these E cells could also change behavior pattern from single locomotor rhythms to courtship rhythms in case of social situations change from single to pair . A complex sequence of mating behavior is required to propagate healthy offspring among sexu-ally reproductive animals . Based on this notion , sex-ual behavior in Drosophila has been investigated as an obvious candidate for involvement in the tempo-ral separation of subpopulations during the speciation process Sakai Ishida 2001 Tauber et al. 2003 . If this is true for Drosophila species , the rhythmic nat-ure of CP behavior might be conserved among wild-type strains of D. melanogaster . Thus , we applied CP assays to D. melanogaster wild-type strains , OGS-4 , # 1619 and Canton-S . Although the strength of the rhythmicity in these strains was not as distinct as that in Oregon-R , the dynamics of CP rhythms in all of the wild types were similar Fig. 1 , suggesting that the timing of CP behavior is intrinsic in D. melanogaster . Notably , male-dependent CP rhythms resemble female-dependent sexual receptivity rhythms in the circadian phase Sakai Ishida 2001 Fujii et al. 2007 . The inclination of D. melanogaster to mate at a specific time of day supports the notion that the species-specific timing of reproductive behavior causes reproductive isolation with subse-quent Drosophila speciation Sakai Ishida 2001 Tauber et al. 2003 Rogers et al. 2004 Nishinokubi et al. 2006 . M cells and E cells regulate activity bouts at dawn and dusk . In addition , these cells couple to adapt behavior to seasonal environmental changes M cells dominate during short days and E cells dominate dur-ing long days Stoleru et al. 2007 . The dual-oscillator model of entrainment described by Pittendrigh Daan 1976 suggests that E cells are dominant during summer days . Our findings suggested that E cells rather than M cells play a predominant role in CP rhythms . The predominant role of E cells on CP rhythms implies that summer days are suitable for reproduction in D. melanogaster . Furthermore , the two-oscillator model explains adaptation to seasonal changes in day length even in mammals and suggests that such clock networks in the brain are common between Drosophila and mammals Rieger et al. 2006 Stoleru et al. 2007 Mendoza et al. 2009 . Experimental procedures Fly strains We used the wild-type strains , Oregon-R , Canton-S , OGS-4 and # 1619 . The following stock lines provided by M. Rosbash were used for targeted neuronal ablation yw , UAS-hid ? CyO + , yw pdf-GAL4 + , yw pdf-GAL80 ? CyO + , and yw + cry - GAL4-13 ? TM6b . Because our video camera was not able to capture flies with yw phenotypes under dim red lights , the first chromosome of all transgenic lines was displaced with the wild-type , Canton-S . The yw + npf-GAL4 strain was pro-vided by P. Shen . All flies were raised under a 12-h light ? 12-h dark cycle at 25 °C . Close-proximity assay Virgin males and females were separated within 6 h of eclo-sion . Approximately 20 flies were maintained in a vial for 6– 9 days . One male and female each of the same genotype were lightly anesthetized with CO2 and rapidly placed in a 35-mm-diameter dish with standard fly food . A recording system was established as described Fujii et al. 2007 . Briefly , dishes con-taining flies were mounted under a CCD camera Watec Co. Ltd. , Yamagata , Japan , which is sensitive to light close to the infrared range . A fluorescent light was used for illumination 100 lux and a red LED for constant dim light 1 lux . Time-lapse images 1 frame per 10 s were sent to a personal computer . The locations of the flies were counted on the X-and Y-axis of the image using an ImageJ Plugin http rsb.in-fo.nih.gov ij . The CP index of each pair was calculated from the X-Y value with a threshold 5 mm between pairs of flies . All CP assays were performed with flies of the same genotypes . Statistical analysis All CP data were averaged for each genotype . The circadian rhythmicity of the CP was determined using autocorrelation analysis Levine et al. 2002 . The free-running period and the power of rhythmicity in each genotype were calculated as the average of the free-running period and the maximum correla-tion value of each pair that were evaluated as rhythmic by the autocorrelation analysis . The period and number of rhythmic pairs were statistically analyzed using a two-tailed t-test , and the numbers of immunolabeled cells were analyzed using the Mann–Whitney U-test . Immunocytochemistry As the anti-CLK antiserum intensely labels clock cells at any time of the day Houl et al. 2006 , all clock neurons could be identified independently of the phase of circadian protein expression oscillation . Anti-PDF serum was used to identify PDF-negative 5th-s-LNv from PDF-positive LNvs . The immunocytochemical protocol basically followed the described procedure Houl et al. 2006 . In short , the central nervous sys-tem of the adult flies was fixed with PEM-FA fixative . The tissues were extensively washed in phosphate-buffered saline containing Triton-X and then incubated overnight at 4 °C with a mixture of primary anti-CLK and anti-PDF antisera that were detected using Cy3-conjugated goat anti-guinea pig antiserum and FITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antiserum , respectively . Specimens were inspected under a Zeiss Axioplan 2 microscope and a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope Zeiss , Jena , Germany . Images were obtained using a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope . Stacks of confocal images were projected into an image using a Zeiss LSM image browser . Acknowledgements We thank P. Shen University of Georgia , Athens , GA , USA , T.

21113144	A Khammari1 , F Agnes1,2 , ` P Gandille1 and A-M Pret* , 1,3,4 In metazoans , apoptosis is widely used during development to reach proper cell number by elimination of targeted individual cells.1 In Drosophila , apoptosis has been implicated in several specific cell number reduction processes , such as the selection of exactly three glial cells from nine precursors at the ventral midline of each embryonic segment2 and the survival of exactly six secondary pigment cells per omatidium allowing formation of the highly ordered hexagonal lattice of the fly compound eye.3 The components of the apoptosis machinery have been shown to be highly conserved during evolution , 4 but the mechanisms underlying these types of exquisitely precise survival versus death choices in the context of the whole organism are not as yet fully understood . Apoptosis is caused by proteolytic cleavage of vital proteins by a group of aspartate-specific cysteine proteases , called caspases.4 The mammalian genomes encode 14 distinct caspases , while the Drosophila genome bears 7 caspase-encoding genes . In Drosophila , caspases are maintained in an inactive state in virtually all cells by a specific class of proteins called inhibitors of apoptosis IAPs that are bound to caspases and inhibit their activity.5,6 In the presence of apoptotic stimuli , IAP antagonists are activated and www.nature.com cdd competitively bind to IAPs through an IAP-binding motif IBM leading to IAP ubiquitination and consequent degrada-tion of both IAPs and IBM-domain proteins.7,8 In mammals , both IAPs and IBM-domain proteins of the Smac Diablo and Omi HtrA2 families are also present , but they are ubiquitously expressed . In contrast , the IBM-domain proteins Reaper , Hid and Grim RHG in Drosophila are transcriptionally activated in response to many different hormonal , stress and develop-mental signals.7 Post-transcriptional regulation has been also reported for Hid.2 Most of these studies are based on in vitro analysis or in vivo models in which apoptosis is induced . Thus , how the cell death machinery is activated in vivo during development is still poorly understood . In the Drosophila ovary , polar cells PCs form clusters of specialized somatic cells embedded in the follicular epithelium at anterior and posterior follicle poles and in contact with the germline Figure 1a . PCs have an important organizer function at several stages during oogenesis Figure 1a .9,10 In particular , PCs are the only ovarian cells to secrete Unpaired1 Upd1 , a specific ligand of the JAK STAT signaling pathway . By activating this signaling pathway in adjacent follicle cells during mid-oogenesis , anterior PCs induce their differentiation into border cells and , subsequently , PCs and border cells migrate together through the egg chamber to attain the oocyte and subsequently form the micropyle , the sperm entry point into the oocyte Figure 1a .11,12 During early stages of oogenesis , PCs undergo a highly regulated cell death program , whereby a small excess of PCs that is produced 1–4 supernumerary cells is eliminated by apoptosis such that by mid-oogenesis 100 % of the follicles contain exactly two PCs at each anterior and posterior extremity.13 This restriction fulfills a physiologi-cal role as inducing prolonged survival of supernumerary PCs by blocking apoptosis leads to follicular cell patterning defects including recruitment of excess border cells and perturbed migration of these cells.13 PCs thus represent an interesting model to study how cell survival death choices are made , in particular , in the context of a whole organ . We have under-taken a genetic and cellular analysis of PC apoptosis to identify which of the known components of the core cell death machinery are specifically involved in PC apoptosis and which represents regulatory points . Results Ovarian PC death involves apical constriction , rounding up and exclusion of dying cells during which caspase activation occurs . The number of PCs per follicle extremity between stages 3 and 10 of oogenesis was assayed by immunostaining for Fasciclin III Fas3 in the presence and absence of the caspase inhibitor p35 Figure 1d and e , red 2F–J , red Table 1 . In parallel , the morphology of the individual PCs comprising a cluster was determined by immunodetection of either PC-expressed membrane-addressed mCD8 GFP upd-GAL4 driver or endogenous upd-gal4 + UAS-mCD8 GFP + upd-gal4 + UAS-p35 UAS-mCD8 GFP membrane Fas3 . During early stage 2 , the PC clusters 3–5 cells or PC pairs , at both the anterior and posterior poles , are comprised of flattened cells with their long axis perpendicular to the anterior–posterior axis of the ovariole Figure 1b and c , green and data not shown . As of stage 3 Figure 1d and e , red and green , PCs change shape , becoming polarized along the follicular epithelial apical basal axis with points of convergence between the cells at the apical poles Figure 1d0 and e0 , red , arrowhead . In some groups of three or more PCs , all cells in the group are equivalent in size and maintain both apical–basal contacts Figures 1d0 , 2A and F . In other groups of more than two PCs , the supernumerary cell or cells exhibit constriction at the apical contact , progressive lengthening of the apical constriction Figure 2B–D and G–I , white arrows , rounding up and reduction in size Figure 2B–D and G–I , yellow arrows and basal displacement Figure 2B , D , I and J . Importantly , the use of specific antibodies demonstrated that the shrinking PCs specifically accumulate an activated form of caspases Figure 2B–D , green and are , therefore , the PCs destined to die . Interestingly , the intermediate steps in the morphological changes in PCs destined to die were even more apparent upon expression of p35 in these cells , possibly because the process of cell elimination is blocked at a downstream step Figure 2F–J . Finally , even when blocking caspase function by p35 leads to prolonged survival of supernumerary PCs Table 1 , the PCs destined to die nonetheless undergo morphological and polarity changes Figure 2D and E , rightmost yellow arrow and F–J . Among effector caspases , Drice is specifically implicated in PC apoptosis . We used UAS-RNAi transgenic lines targeting the caspase-encoding genes drice , dcp1 , decay , damm and strica that had been previously validated upon hid-induced apoptosis in the Drosophila eye.14 We induced expression of the UAS-RNAi transgenic constructs specifically as of stage 2 of oogenesis using either the neur-Gal4 or the upd-Gal4 drivers see Figure 1b–e for the upd-Gal4 expression profile and data not shown and determined the number of PCs using the Fas3 marker and expression of a UAS-H2B YFP transgene . Only RNAi directed against the drice gene resulted in prolonged survival of supernumerary PCs up to five cells at both anterior and posterior follicle poles after stage 6 of oogenesis Figure 3b and d compare with a and c Table 2 . At the anterior pole , the presence of an excess number of PCs was associated with a delay in PC border cell migration at stage 10 Figure 3b compared with wild type Figure 3a see Supplementary Table 1 . A second drice RNAi transgenic line also gave high levels of supernumerary PCs with the same driver and a second PC driver , neur-Gal4 , as well data not shown . However , we next recovered females homozygous for the amorphic sublethal driceD1 allele and found that dissected ovaries immunostained for Fas3 did not exhibit prolonged survival of more than two PCs after stage 6 of oogenesis data not shown . As the drice RNAi transgenic construct used also targets dcp1 sequences strong off target , we tested the strong hypomorphic dcp1prev allele , which is homozygous viable however , homozygous females did not display super-numerary PC after stage 6 of oogenesis data not shown . We were not able to recover driceD1 dcp1prev double mutants due to fully penetrant lethality . We , therefore , recombined the driceD1 allele with an FRT insertion on the same chromosome and generated homozygous driceD1 mitotic clones FLP–FRT system in PCs heterozygous for dcp1prev . In this genetic context , we did not observe an effect on PC number during late stages of oogenesis data not shown . The initiator caspase Dronc and its adaptor Dark are required for PC apoptosis . We expressed transgenic RNAi lines to inactivate the function of the Drosophila caspase-encoding genes dronc15,16 and dredd17 in PCs and only RNAi directed against the dronc gene resulted in prolonged survival of excess PCs at both anterior and posterior poles data not shown . As amorphic alleles for the dronc gene are available dronci29 and dronci24 , as well as for dark , encoding its specific adaptor , 18 darkG8 and darkH16 , we tested the effect of these mutations on PC apoptosis . These mutations are lethal during development , so we induced homozygous mutant mitotic clones in the ovaries using the FLP–FRT system and loss of ubi-GFP expression as a clone marker . Under these conditions , we found groups of Fas3 ? PCs with more than two cells either three or four after stage 6 of oogenesis at both anterior and posterior poles and in each case at least one PC in the group exhibited no GFP expression and , therefore , was homozygous mutant for either dronc or dark Figure 4a–f . When only one PC in a group was homozygous mutant for dronc or dark , this cell often exhibited the morphological characteristics of a PC destined to die , that is diminished apical contacts with the other cells , rounding up and reduced size Figure 4a and d , arrows . In addition , in all mosaic groups composed of both GFP ? and GFP PCs , the cell or cells in the process of being extruded were always GFP Figure 4a , b , d and e , yellow arrows . These results indicate cell autonomous function of dronc and the adaptor-encoding dark within the PCs destined die to allow this process to occur . Among the RHG family members , Hid is specifically required for PC apoptosis . We next tested the possible function of three RHG family members , reaper , hid and grim by generating FLP–FRT mitotic clones , marked by the absence of GFP expression , of the H99 deletion that covers all three genes . We found groups of PCs with more than two PCs three to five cells marked by Fas3 during late stages of oogenesis at both anterior and posterior poles and in each case at least one PC was homozygous for the H99 deletion Figure 5a and b . We next expressed UAS-RNAi transgenic lines in PCs to test , individually , the functions of hid , grim and sickle , a fourth RHG not covered in the H99 deletion , in PC apoptosis . Only RNAi directed against the hid gene , using two different RNAi transgenic constructions NIG and VDRC collections and two different PC drivers , upd-Gal4 and neur-Gal4 , led to pro-longed survival of more than two PCs at late stages of oogenesis at both anterior and posterior poles Figure 5c , d and data not shown Table 2 . At the anterior pole , the presence of excess PCs was associated with a significant delay in PC border cell migration Figure 5c compare with wild type in Figure 3a see Supplementary Table 1 . We also analyzed both reaper and hid null escapers for PC number after stage 6 of oogenesis . The reaper XR38 Df 3L H99 female escapers showed no PC number pheno-type data not shown , while hid P [ 5014 ] Df 3L R ? X1 and hid P [ 5014 ] Df 3L H99 female escapers displayed more than two PCs at 100 % of follicle extremities , anterior and posterior , after stage 6 Figures 5e , f and 7g , h . The hid mutant phenotype was , therefore , highly penetrant , and as the majority of follicle poles had more than three PCs four , five or six PCs Figure 5e , f and data not shown , highly expressive as well . These results , therefore , indicate that , among RHG family members , Hid is specifically required for PC apoptosis . upd-gal4 + UAS-H2B YFP + upd-gal4 + UAS-driceIRa + UAS-H2B YFP + upd-gal4 + UAS-hidIRa UAS-H2B YFP In some clusters of three or four PCs , the supernumerary PCs nonetheless exhibited loss of apical of apical contact , round-ing up and shrinking Figure 7g and h , yellow arrows . hid transcription is specifically activated in PCs destined to die . We determined the Hid expression profile in the ovary using specific anti-Hid antibodies and marked PCs specifically by Fas3 accumulation . In wild-type ovaries , no Hid protein accumulation was detected in any cell type Figure 6a , a0 and data not shown . However , blocking PC apoptosis by overexpression of the p35 caspase inhibitor specifically in PCs led to detectible accumulation of Hid in supernumerary PCs Figure 6b and b0 , yellow arrow . It was also possible to detect Hid in supernumerary PCs by removing caspase function using RNAi or amorphic mutations directed against dronc or drice Figure 6c–f , yellow arrows . In all cases , Hid was detected in PCs shrinking and undergoing exclusion from the group , therefore , indicating that Hid is specifically expressed in PCs destined to die . Interestingly , when two supernumerary PCs were present , both cells did not necessarily accumulate Hid , indicating that the process of PC elimination is not synchronized within the PC group Figure 6c , e and f , yellow arrows . Taken together with the results of the analysis of hid mutants indicating that hid is necessary for PC apoptosis , these results strongly suggest that PC apoptosis is induced by specific upregulation of Hid in PCs destined to die . In order to determine whether specific accumulation of Hid in PCs destined to die is regulated at the transcript level , we performed RNA in situ hybridization on ovaries using a hid riboprobe . The specificity of the hid probe was verified in the embryo as the hid expression profile has been characterized in this tissue http www.fruitfly.org cgi-bin ex insitu.pl and data not shown . In the wild-type ovary , relatively strong hid germline signal equivalent to what is observed in Figure 6g – gc was observed , as has been previously reported , 19 but no expression was evident in any somatic cells including the PC groups at any stage data not shown . However , when caspase activity was blocked by overexpres-sion of p35 in PCs , then significant accumulation of hid transcripts was detected specifically in one somatic cell at poles of follicles from stage 4 onwards Figure 6g and g0 , white asterisk . The position of these cells at follicle extremities and the fact that their shape differs from that of other somatic cells in the follicular epithelium in that they display apical constric-tion and rounding up strongly suggest that these are PCs destined to die . These results thus allow us to propose that Hid protein is upregulated in PCs destined to die because of specific hid transcript accumulation in these cells . Hid controls Diap1 post-translational downregulation in PCs destined to die . We determined the expression pattern of Diap1 protein in the ovary and found that Diap1 accumulates in all follicle cells Figure 7a–c , in mature PC pairs Figure 7d , white arrowheads and in germline nurse cells Figure 7a . The specificity of the Diap1 antibodies was confirmed by testing them on ovaries expressing an RNAi construct targeting diap1 sequences specifically in PCs see Supplementary Figure 1a . In clusters of three PCs during early oogenesis two PCs displayed high Diap1 levels , but three different situations were encountered for the supernumerary PC . In 50 % of the clusters of three PCs , one out of the three PCs presented no detectable Diap1 protein Figure 7a00 and a000 , lower white arrowhead , while in 31 % of the clusters , Diap1 was present at low levels in one out of the three PCs Figure 7b00 and b000 , lower white arrowhead and in only a minority of cases 19 % all three PCs of a cluster exhibited similar high levels of Diap1 protein Figure 7c00 and c000 , white arrowheads Table 3 . Upon ectopic expression of the anti-apoptotic factor p35 , a high proportion of follicle poles present PC clusters with three or four PCs Table 1 . Under these conditions , 100 % of PC clusters with more than two PCs after stage 6 n ? 85 exhibited at least two Diap1 ? PCs Figure 7e00 and e000 , top arrowheads and one or two PCs with no detectable or extremely low Diap1 accumulation Figure 7e00 and e000 , two bottom arrowheads . In these cases as well , the Diap1 supernumerary PCs were often round and basally positioned , indicating that they are the PCs that were destined to die Figure 7e00 and e000 , two bottom arrow-heads . Taken together , these results strongly suggest that Diap1 is differentially regulated in the PC cluster such that two PCs accumulate Diap1 affording them protection from apoptosis , while supernumerary PCs undergo down-regulation of Diap1 , thereby allowing caspase activation and death to occur . We next assayed Diap1 accumulation in PC clusters in which hid function is knocked down by transgenic RNAi . Clusters of three or four PCs survived after stage 6 of oogenesis Table 2 , and this was associated with a greater proportion of clusters exhibiting Diap1 accumulation in all cells of the cluster compared with wild type Table 3 . Expression of hid RNAi leads to a majority of clusters from stages 7 to 10 with three Diap1 ? PCs 47 % compared with only 19 % in the wild-type control Figure 7f , and only a minority exhibited complete Diap1 downregulation in the supernumerary PC s 15 % compared with 50 % in the wild-type control . Diap1 accumulation was also assayed in ovaries from hid mutant escapers of two different genotypes , hid P [ 5014 ] Df 3L H99 , which removes one copy of reaper as well as affecting both copies of hid and hid P [ 5014 ] Df 3L R ? X1 , which only affects hid and similar results were obtained in both cases . Almost all follicle extremities after stage 6 exhibited groups of more than two PCs as detected by membrane accumulation of Fas3 Figure 7g , three PCs and Figure 7h and h0 , four PCs observed in two different focal planes and Diap1 protein was never absent in the supernumerary PCs Figure 7g0 , h and h0 , yellow arrows , in contrast to the situation in controls in which Diap1 was often low or absent in these cells Figure 7a , b and e . These results , therefore , indicate that hid function is necessary for downregulation of Diap1 in supernumerary PCs destined to die . In addition , as supernumerary PCs devoid of hid function and presenting Diap1 accumulation nevertheless exhibited loss of apical contact , rounding up and shrinkage Figure 7g and h , yellow arrows , it would seem that these processes do not require hid function or Diap1 down-regulation . A diap1-lacZ reporter construct , shown to be correctly regulated in other tissue contexts in Drosophila , 20 was expressed in all cells of PC clusters of three or more cells , even when one PC was already showing signs of apical detachment and shrinking Figure 7i and j . Therefore , downregulation of Diap1 in PCs destined to die likely occurs post-transcriptionally . Discussion We show that PC apoptosis involves a canonical Hid–Diap1– Dronc Dark–Drice apoptotic pathway like the one described by Leulier et al.14 in the Drosophila eye upon ectopic expression of Hid and consequent apoptosis . Our study , therefore , provides the confirmation that this pathway is functional in a physiological case of developmental apoptosis . Leulier et al.14 also found evidence for a second pathway involving Hid-induced activation of the caspases Strica and Decay , independent of Diap1 . Using the same genetic tools they used transgenic RNAi lines , however , we found no involvement of Strica or Decay functions in PC apoptosis . This difference might reflect a different level of Hid expression in the two systems . The high level of Hid induced in the eye by transgene expression may allow activation of Strica and Decay , while the physiological level of Hid in supernumerary PCs may not be sufficient to do so . A role for effector caspases in PC apoptosis is strongly suggested by p35-induced survival of supernumerary PCs and specific caspase activation in PCs destined to die . In addition , among the transgenic RNAi lines targeting four Table 3 Diap1 protein accumulation in polar cells during oogenesis in control and hid RNAi contexts Control stages 2–6 8 16 50 % 5 16 31 % 3 16 19 % hid IR stages 2–6 4 11 36 % 5 11 45 % 2 11 18 % hid IR stages 7–10 2 13 15 % 5 13 33 % 6 13 47 % effector caspase-encoding genes , drice , dcp1 , decay and damm previously validated by Leulier et al.14 , only RNAi directed against drice led to prolonged survival of excess PCs . However , females homozygous for the null driceD1 or the strong hypomorphic dcp1prev1 allele , as well as driceD1 D1 dcp1prev1 ? females and driceD1 D1 PC mitotic clones in a dcp1prev1 ? background undergo PC apoptosis normally . As redundant function between these two genes has been reported in several cell types , 21 the best interpretation for our results is that drice and dcp1 and possible decay and or damm as well exhibit redundant function for PC apoptosis . Among Dredd , Dronc and Strica , which resemble inititator caspases , 22 Dronc is specifically required for many of the known developmental cell death programs , with specific exceptions , as well as in radiation-induced apopotosis15,16,23 along with the adaptor protein , Apaf-1 Dark.18,24,25 Our analysis of dronc and dark null mutations indicates that both are necessary for PC apoptosis cell autonomously in PCs destined to die . The partnership between Dronc and Dark thus seems maintained in the case of PC apoptosis , further supporting the idea that Dronc and Dark are universal partners for induction of apoptosis . Control of caspase activation in PCs likely involves Diap1 function for several reasons . Indeed , Diap1 protein , present in all other germline and somatic cells of the ovary , is specifically downregulated in PCs destined to die . This regulation is likely to be post-translational as we show that expression of a diap1-lacZ enhancer trap is ubiquitous even in clusters in which supernumerary PCs are undergoing elimination . In addition , inactivation of diap1 by RNAi specifically in PCs leads to progressive degradation and demise of PC pairs , indicating that Diap1 is necessary for survival of mature PCs Supple-mentary Figure 1b–e . In view of the known function of Diap1 in inhibition of caspase activity , 5 our results allow us to propose that specific downregulation of Diap1 in PCs destined to die leads to caspase activation in these cells and consequent apoptosis . We have also implicated a specific member of the RHG family of known Diap1 antagonists in PC apoptosis.26 Among several genes tested , we show that the function of hid is specifically necessary for PC apoptosis . The functions of reaper , hid and grim have been shown to be largely redundant in developmental cell death , though some specific pheno-types are associated with single gene mutations.27–30 Our results clearly indicate a specific , essential function for hid in PC apoptosis and thus distinguish individual developmental roles for members of the RHG family . However , a role for some of the other RHGs , in particular Reaper , though possibly redundant or secondary , is not to be excluded . Indeed , we have previously shown that a lacZ transcriptional reporter for the reaper gene is activated in PCs destined to die when PC apoptosis is blocked by expression of p35.13 It is thus possible that hid function is necessary for primary induction of PC apoptosis and that reaper function participates to a secondary amplification loop that insures completion of PC elimination . In addition , we have been able to establish a link between hid function and Diap1 regulation in PC apoptosis . Signifi-cantly , upon RNAi knockdown of hid function specifically in the PC group , or in hid mutant escapers , the supernumerary PCs that survive until late stages of oogenesis show maintained Diap1 expression likely explaining their prolonged survival . Although RHG family regulation of Diap1 levels by promoting Diap1 autoubiquitination and degradation has been shown through biochemical studies in vitro and upon ectopic overexpression of RHG proteins , 25,27,31–33 this is the first demonstration , combining both genetic evidence and analysis of protein accumulation in situ , of Hid-mediated Diap1 downregulation in a case of developmental apoptosis invol-ving physiological levels of both of these proteins . Some studies report a significantly higher capacity for Reaper than for Hid in blocking Diap1 activity , 32 but our results show a specific role for Hid in Diap1 regulation for PC apoptosis . Finally , we identify hid as an important regulatory point in the apoptotic cascade responsible for PC death . The accumulation of Hid has been shown to be regulated at both the transcriptional and post-transcriptional level depending on the tissue.34 In PCs , both Hid protein and hid transcripts accumulate specifically in supernumerary PCs destined to die , indicating upregulation of hid transcription and or stabi-lization of hid mRNA . It is important to note , however , that detection of hid expression in PCs was not possible in a wild-type context . It was necessary to block PC apoptosis by knocking-down caspase function ectopic p35 expression or mutations in caspase-encoding genes in order to reveal the presence of Hid protein or hid transcripts in supernumerary PCs normally destined to die . Therefore , in the wild type , both hid transcripts and Hid protein are likely short-lived and or transient , and induction of prolonged survival of super-numerary PCs by blocking caspase activity may allow increased accumulation , and thus detection , of these gene products . The accumulated Hid protein in supernumerary PCs induced in these genetic contexts appears to be functional as these cells exhibit highly efficient downregulation of Diap1 . Polar and border cell migration is also delayed to the same extent by mutations affecting different apoptotic players hid , drice , caspases in general Supplementary Table 1 . In addition , in all three genetic contexts tested , clusters with four PCs were more perturbed in their migration than clusters with three PCs Supplementary Table 1 . These results suggest that these migration defects are likely a consequence of the elevated number of PCs surviving into late stages of oogenesis , rather than reflecting a non-apoptotic role for these molecules in migration per se . During the PC elimination process , PCs destined to die exhibit apical constriction followed by apical detachment from the germline and reduction in the contact with the other PCs leading to progressive shrinking of these cells . These morphological and polarity events may not depend on the Hid-mediated caspase activation , as they seem to occur before caspase activation and in the loss-of-function contexts we tested including hid escapers , which exhibited almost 100 % of follicle poles with more than two PCs . It will be interesting to develop an in vivo real-time approach , which may reveal the sequence of events during PC apoptosis . Materials and Methods Fly strains .

Specialized somatic cells are indicated by different colors , polar cells in green , interfolicular cells in red and border cells in blue . Groups of supernumerary polar cells restrict to only a pair of cells between stages 2 and 5 .

21143350	Introduction Nucleotide excision repair NER is a versatile DNA repair system that removes a wide range of DNA lesions including UV damage Friedberg et al. 2006 . There are two subpathways in NER . One is tran-scription-coupled NER TC-NER , which preferen-tially removes transcription-blocking DNA damage from the transcribed strand in active genes . Another is global genome NER GG-NER , which removes lesions throughout the genome Hanawalt Spivak 2008 . There are two autosomal recessive disorders that are specifically deficient in TC-NER Cockayne syndrome CS and UV-sensitive syndrome UVsS . CS is characterized by photosensitivity and abnormal-ities in physical and neurologic development such as postnatal growth failure , cachectic dwarfism , mental retardation , pigmentary retinopathy , deafness , bird-like face , and short life span approximately 10 years . However , patients with CS have no predisposition to significantly decreased in FS3 and CS1AN cells trans-fected with siPGBD3-1 . In addition , the truncated CSB protein with an apparent MW of 70 kDa was also decreased in CS3PV cells when transfected with siPGBD3-1 . These results indicated that p150 was derived from CPFP mRNA in WT and CS-B cells , and that the 70 kDa truncated CSB protein in CS3PV cells 3PV-CSB was also derived from CPFP mRNA with a nonsense mutation at amino acid posi-tion 453 453Arg to stop Fig. 2B . Consistent with these results , Western blot analysis of CPFP with anti-PGBD3 antibody in normal and CS-B cells indi-cated that p150 contains PGBD3 protein in these cells Fig. S2 in Supporting Information . Purification of WT-CSB , CPFP , and 3PV-CSB protein complexes In order to test for an inhibitory function of CPFP and 3PV-CSB , we examined protein complex forma-tion with WT-CSB , CPFP , and 3PV-CSB . HEK293 cell lines that stably express the C-terminally FLAG-6·His-tagged WT-CSB , CPFP , and 3PV-CSB , respectively were established . Whole-cell extracts of these cell lines were subjected to affinity purifications using a nickel chelate and anti-FLAG antibody , and the purified WT-CSB , CPFP , and 3PV-CSB protein complexes were analyzed by SDS–PAGE and visual-ized with silver staining Fig. 3A . Mass spectrometric and Western blot analyses of each purified complex showed that all of the CSB protein complexes con-tained DNA topoisomerase I Top1 Fig. 3B , C . To confirm the interaction between CSB and Top1 , we carried out the reciprocal experiment by establishing a HEK293 cell line stably expressing the HA-FLAG-tagged Top1 HAF-Top1 . Whole-cell extracts from these cells were immunoprecipitated by anti-FLAG antibody , and the elutants were subjected to SDS– PAGE , followed by Western blotting using the anti-CSB antibody . As shown in Fig. 3D , WT-CSB and CPFP were bound to Top1 . We then examined whether Top1 directly interacts with WT-CSB , CPFP , and 3PV-CSB proteins . The purified WT-CSB and HAF-Top1 proteins were active in DNA-dependent ATPase and topoisomerase assays , respectively Fig. S3 and Data S1 in Supporting Information . WT-CSB , CPFP , and 3PV-CSB pro-teins were immobilized onto nickel Sepharose beads and incubated with HAF-Top1 . After washing with buffer , the bound proteins were analyzed by SDS– PAGE and Western blotting using anti-HA antibody . As shown in Fig. 3E , WT-CSB , CPFP , and 3PV-CSB proteins directly bound Top1 . Taken together , these results indicate that WT-CSB , CPFP , and 3PV-CSB can each interact with Top1 in human cells . Subcellular distribution of Top1 , WT-CSB , and CPFP To verify the interaction between Top1 and WT-CSB or CPFP in vivo , we examined the subcellular distribu-tion of these proteins using confocal fluorescent microscopy . CS3AM primary cells were co-transfected with the N-terminally EGFP tagged-Top1 EGFP-Top1 and the C-terminally DsRed-Monomer-tagged WT-CSB WT-CSB-DsRed or CPFP CPFP-DsRed . The predominant accumulation of both EGFP-Top1 and WT-CSB-DsRed was detected in the nucleoli , in addition to a homogeneous distribution in the nucleo-plasm Fig. 3F . In contrast , the major population of CPFP-DsRed distributed in the nucleoplasm Fig. 3G . These in vivo data suggest that WT-CSB associates with Top1 both in nucleoli and nucleoplasm , whereas CPFP associates with Top1 mainly in nucleoplasm . It is known that Top1 rapidly moves from nucleoli to nucleoplasm after treatment of the cells with anti-cancer drug camptothecin CPT Leppard Champoux 2005 . In order to determine whether WT-CSB and CPFP show dynamic distribution as well as Top1 after CPT treatment , we examined the sub-cellular distribution of EGFP-Top1 , WT-CSB-DsRed , and CPFP-DsRed in the CPT-treated cells . Both A B C F H EGFP-Top1 and WT-CSB-DsRed rapidly moved from nucleoli to nucleoplasm after CPT treatment Fig. 3H . CPFP-DsRed remained in nucleoplasm after CPT treatment Fig. 3I . These in vivo data indi-cate that CSB and CPFP interact with Top1 in the nucleoplasm of the CPT-treated cells . Repair of Top1–DNA covalent complex in the CPFP-expressing CS-B cells Top1 reversibly nicks DNA and relaxes superhelical tension in DNA induced during replication and tran-scription . In the process , it generates a reversible and transient intermediate known as Top1–DNA covalent complex Top1-cc , in which Top1 is covalently attached via a tyrosyl residue human Tyr723 to the 3¢-terminus of a single-stranded nick . Following the release of torsional stress , Top1 reseals the nick and restores the integrity of the double helix by re-liga-tion Champoux 2001 . CPT is known to block the re-ligation reaction of Top1 , resulting in accumula-tion of Top1-cc . These considerations prompted us to perform an immunocomplex of enzyme ICE assay Muller et al. 1985 Miao et al. 2006 to examine whether the repair of CPT-induced Top1-cc is decreased in hTERT-immortalized CS-B fibroblast cells expressing CPFP , when compared with the isogenic CS-B cells in which CPFP was downregulated . Because it has been reported that the repair of CPT-induced Top1-cc was defective in SV40-transformed cells and some kinds of cancer cells Desai et al. 2001 , 2003 , we used primary fibroblast cells and hTERT-immortalized cells derived from normal human and CS-B patients for the mea-surement of repair of Top1-cc . For ICE assay , cells were treated with CPT , and then lysed . DNA–protein complex was isolated from cell lysates by centrifuga-tion on cesium chloride step gradients , and Top1-cc was detected by immunoblotting of the DNA-protein complex with anti-Top1 monoclonal antibody . TelCOFS02MA is an hTERT-immortalized CS-B fibroblast cell line Meira et al. 2000 derived from a patient with cerebro-oculo-facio-skeletal syndrome COFSS and has a homozygous mutation in CSB gene 3794–3795-bp deletion leading to a frame shift followed by stop codon at the 1240 amino acid resi-due Fig. 1A and Table S1 Supporting Information . The phenotype of COFSS is very similar to CS , including abnormal facies , microcephaly , and a similar pattern of neurologic abnormalities Friedberg et al. 2006 . TelCOFS02MA cells produce only CPFP and p30 Fig. 1B . To confirm the inhibitory function of CPFP in the repair of CPT-induced Top1-cc , the amount of Top1-cc was measured in TelCOFS02MA cells in which CPFP was knocked down by siPGBD3-2 Figs 4A , 1C . TelCOFS02MA cells transfected with siLucGL3 were established as a control Fig. 4A . As shown in Fig. 4B , C , the amount of Top1-cc induced by the treatment with 2 lM CPT for 1h was decreased in the CPFP-knockdown TelCOFS02MA cells , when compared with the siLucGL3 transfected control cells . Then , we examined whether the inhibition of repair of CPT-induced Top1-cc because of CPFP is sup-pressed by the expression of exogenous WT-CSB in TelCOFS02MA cells Fig. 4D . The amount of CPT-induced Top1-cc was decreased in TelCOFS02MA cells expressing WT-CSB cells , compared with those expressing vector alone Fig. 4E , F . Taken together , these results indicate that CPFP inhibited the repair of CPT-induced Top1-cc , but the inhibition was sup-pressed by the concomitant presence of WT-CSB . The increased amount of CPT-induced Top1-cc in CPFP-expressing CS-B cells could be caused by not only a defect in repair of Top1-cc , but also increased formation of Top1-cc because WT-CSB and CPFP are bound to Top1 . In order to examine which explanation is more plausible for the increased Top1-cc in CS-B cells , we measured Top1-cc in CPFP-knockdown and control TelCOFS02MA cells that were incubated for 5 h after CPT treatment . Cells were treated with 2 lM CPT for 6 h . In the 6 h CPT treatment , the amount of Top1-cc was sim-ilar in CPFP-knockdown cells and in control cells at 0-h incubation Fig. 4G , H , indicating saturation of Top1-cc induced by long exposure of CPT . How-ever , the amount of Top1-cc was much lower in CPFP-knockdown TelCOFS02MA cells than in con-trol cells after 5-h incubation Fig. 4G , H . These results indicate that the increased amount of Top1-cc in CPFP-expressing CS-B cells is mainly because of a defect in repair of CPT-induced Top1-cc . CPT-induced inhibition of transcription in CPFP-knockdown and control TelCOFS02MA cells It is known that when RNA polymerase II RNAP2 is encountered with Top1-cc , transcription is rapidly arrested , and then restored on repair of Top1-cc el-Khamisy Caldecott 2007 . Therefore , we measured a RNA synthesis after CPT treatment in the CPFP knockdown and control TelCOFS02MA cells . As shown in Fig. 5A , RNA synthesis was markedly decreased in both CPFP knockdown and control cells immediately after CPT treatment 0 h , and further Camptothecin-induced Top1-cc generates Top1-concealed single-strand DNA breaks Top1-SSBs by B D decreased 2 h after CPT treatment . Then , the RNA synthesis recovered in CPFP-knockdown and control TelCOFS02MA cells , but the recovery was greater in CPFP-knockdown cells compared with control cells Fig. 5A . These results indicate that the recovery of RNA synthesis after CPT treatment is inhibited by the presence of CPFP . collision with RNAP2 or some types of DNA lesions . In order to validate that CS-B cells expressing CPFP have a defect in repair of CPT-induced Top1-cc , we measured the CPT-induced Top1-SSBs in the CPFP-knockdown and control TelCOFS02MA cells . CPFP-knockdown and control TelCOFS02MA cells were treated with CPT 2.5 lM , and then SSBs were directly measured by the alkaline comet assay . As shown in Fig. 5B , the mean comet tail moment was the same in CPFP-knockdown and control Tel-COFS02MA cells without CPT treatment . On the other hand , after CPT treatment of the cells 2.5 lM , the mean tail moment was significantly increased in cells transfected with control siRNA , whereas the increase was significantly less in CPFP-knockdown cells , both immediately and 1 h after CPT treatment . These results indicate that repair of CPT-induced Top1-SSBs is inhibited by the presence of CPFP . It was reported that the repair of Top1-cc after CPT treatment is correlated with degradation of Top1 and the largest subunit Rpb1 of RNAP2 by 26S protea-some Desai et al. 2003 , and that Rpb1 is hyper-phosphorylated in HCT116 cells treated with CPT Sordet et al. 2008 . In order to address the possible function of CPFP protein in the repair of Top1-cc , the CPT-induced hyperphosphorylation of Rpb1 , and degradation of Rpb1 and Top1 were examined in CPFP-knockdown and control TelCOFS02MA cells . In our experimental conditions using TelCOFS02MA cells , the major population of Rpb1 was hyperphosph-orylated before CPT treatment , therefore no significant shift from hypophosphorylated form RNAP2a to hyperphosphorylated form RNAP2o after CPT treat-ment could be observed in either CPFP-knockdown or control TelCOFS02MA cells Fig. 5C . In addition , degradation of RNAP2o was not observed Fig. 5C . On the other hand , we observed CPT-induced degra-dation of Top1 that was inhibited by the presence of MG-132 , a proteasomal inhibitor . However , no differ-ence in the degradation profile of Top1 was detected in CPFP-knockdown and control TelCOFS02MA cells in the absence and presence of MG-132 Fig. 5C , D . These results suggest that the presence of CPFP does not affect the degradation of Top1 by pro-teasome following CPT treatment . Discussion Both UVsS and CS can result from mutations in the CSB gene . Here , we show that truncated CSB pro-teins are produced in cells from different CS-B patients , whereas no CSB protein is produced in two UVsS patients , and that these truncated proteins inter-act with Top1 and inhibit the repair of CPT-induced Top1-associated lesions . Importantly , WT-CSB pre-vented the effects of the truncated CSB proteins on Top1-associated lesions , consistent with the known recessive inheritance of CS . These observations indi-cate that the decreased repair of Top1-associated lesions can cause at least a subset of the somatic symptoms observed in CS-B patients . Stable production of truncated CSB proteins due to insertion of piggyBac transposon It is known that most mRNAs with a premature ter-mination codon are targeted for nonsense-mediated mRNA decay NMD , whereas mRNAs containing a premature termination codon located 50–55 nucleo-tides upstream of the ‘3¢-most’ exon–exon junction or downstream of this junction escapes NMD Leje-une Maquat 2005 . Accordingly , a CPFP mRNA with a nonsense mutation within 50–55 nucleotides upstream of the junction of CSB exon 5 and PGBD3 should not be targeted to NMD , leading to the pro-duction of the N-terminal portion of CSB protein using the non-canonical stop codon in CSB exon 5 . CS3PV cells , which are derived from a CS-B patient with CS-features , have a homozygous C1436T non-sense mutation 453Arg to stop in CSB exon 5 that is located 40 nucleotides upstream of the junction of exon 5 and PGBD3 Fig. 2B . Therefore , CPFP mRNA containing this nonsense mutation in exon 5 is not targeted for NMD in CS3PV cells , whereas the full-length spliced CSB mRNA encoding all 21 exons and the same nonsense mutation C1436T transition is targeted for NMD Fig. 2B . As a consequence , the truncated CSB protein 3PV-CSB N-terminal CSB1 452 is stably produced in CS3PV cells Fig. 2B Thus , the insertion of piggyBac sequences into the CSB gene plays a critical role in the production of stable N-terminal truncated CSB proteins in CS-B cells , even when the PGBD3 coding sequences are not translated into protein , as in CS3PV cells . Fur-thermore , the presence of typical CS features in patient CS3PV , despite the fact that the PGBD3 sequences are not translated into protein in the patient’s cells Fig. 2A , B , suggests that the PGBD3 protein per se does not play a role in the CS patho-genesis . Retarded repair of Top1–cc in CPFP-expressing CS-B cells Mass spectrometry and Western blot analysis showed that each complex of WT-CSB , CPFP , and 3PV-CSB proteins contained Top1 , and they directly interacted Fig. 3E . In addition , confocal fluorescent microscopy showed that Top1 , WT-CSB , and CPFP located in the nucleoplasm after CPT treatment Fig. 3H , I . The CSB–Top1 interaction prompted us to examine whether the mutant CSB proteins consist-ing of the N-terminal portions of CSB may inhibit repair of CPT-induced Top1-cc . Using the ICE assay , we found that knockdown of CPFP in TelCOFS02MA CS-B cells resulted in the decreased amount of Top1-cc Fig. 4A–C , and the amount of CPT-induced Top1-cc was decreased in TelCOFS02MA cells by the expression of exogenous WT-CSB Fig. 4D–F . We also found that CPT-induced Top1-cc increased in primary CS3AM cells expressing CPFP or 3PV-CSB when compared with those in CS3AM cells expressing WT-CSB or vector alone Fig. S4 in Supporting Infor-mation . Moreover , the recovery of RNA synthesis after CPT treatment Fig. 5A and the repair of Top1-concealed single-strand DNA breaks Fig. 5B was increased in the CPFP-knockdown CS-B cells . Taken together , these results indicate that CPFP inhibited the repair of CPT-induced Top1-cc , but the inhibition was suppressed by the concomitant presence of WT-CSB , consistent with recessive inheritance of CS-B . Possible role of CSB proteins in Top1-cc repair and implication for CS-B Repair of Top1-cc is divided in the repair ? excision 3¢-end processing of the Top1 covalently linked to the DNA and repair ? religation of the 5¢ end . The most well-known enzyme for 3¢-end processing is tyrosyl-DNA-phosphodiesterase Tdp1 . In addition , it has been known that alternative pathway involving 3¢-flap endonuclease such as Mus81 ? Eme1 , Mre11 ? Rad50 , and XPF ? ERCC1 are also involved in these pathways Pommier 2009 . We propose in the manu-script that there is also a CSB-dependent pathway to repair the Top1-cc . It was reported that the repair of Top1-cc after CPT treatment is correlated with degradation of Top1 and Rpb1 of RNAP2 by 26S proteasome Desai et al. 2003 , and restoration of CPT-induced inhibition of RNA synthesis el-Khamisy Caldecott 2007 . In our experimental conditions using Tel-COFS02MA cells , degradation of RNAP2o was not observed Fig. 5C , whereas CPT-induced degrada-tion of Top1 that was inhibited by the presence of MG-132 , a proteasomal inhibitor , was detected Fig. 5D . However , no difference in the degradation profile of Top1 was detected in CPFP-knockdown and control TelCOFS02MA cells in the absence and presence of MG-132 Fig. 5C , D . These results sug-gested that CPFP does not affect the degradation of Top1 by proteasome following CPT treatment . On the other hand , the recovery of RNA synthesis after CPT treatment and repair of Top1-concealed single - strand breaks was greater in CPFP-knockdown cells compared with control cells Fig. 5A , B . Taking into account these results , we hypothesize that the residual C-terminal Top1 polypeptide containing the Tyr723 residue remains covalently linked to the 3¢-phos-phoryl termini of single-strand nicks via a tyrosyl phosphate bond and results in the inhibition of resumption of RNA synthesis after CPT treatment in CS-B cells . Consistent with this hypothesis , the C-terminal region of Top1 peptide F and G in Fig. S5A–C in Supporting Information is bound to WT-CSB , CPFP , and 3PV-CSB proteins , respec-tively Fig. S5E in Supporting Information . In addi-tion , anti-Top1 antibody used in our study recognized the C-terminal portion of Top1 Fig. S5D in Supporting Information . Top1-cc can result from many different endoge-nous DNA lesions including abasic sites , strand breaks , and oxidative DNA lesions Pourquier Pommier 2001 . Therefore , it is likely that there is a steady-state level of Top1-cc in cells that results in transcription defects and is subject to repair . If so , a transcription abnormality in response to endogenous Top1-cc , resulting from truncated CSB proteins in CS-B cells as we have shown here , could explain some of the CS features in CS-B patients . The neu-rologic abnormalities in CS include microcephaly , myelination defects , and cerebellar degeneration Weidenheim et al. 2009 . Specifically , the cerebellar Purkinje neurons undergo severe degeneration and atrophy in patients with CS Brooks et al. 2008 . Purkinje neurons in the human cerebellum have very high levels of Top-1 compared to other neurons in the brain Gorodetsky et al. 2007 . High levels of Top1 in Purkinje neurons would put these cells at greater risk for Top1-cc , which could explain why these cells are more severely affected by the produc-tion of truncated CSB proteins in CS-B patients than cells with less Top1 . Cockayne syndrome patients with mutations in the CSA gene have essentially the same phenotype as those with mutations in CSB . Both CS-A and CS-B cells are hypersensitive to CPT and also defective in the recovery of RNA synthesis after CPT treatment Squires et al. 1993 Desai et al. 2003 . However , in our present experimental condition , CS-A cells show normal repair of Top1-cc after CPT treatment Fig. S6 in Supporting Information . The mechanistic basis for this feature in CS-A cells remains to be clari-fied . Two patients CS548VI and CS539VI from Reunion Islands , who showed somatic and neuro - logic CS-features and died at the age of 6 and 8 , respectively , had a homozygous deletion in the exon1 and upstream regulatory region of the CSB gene Laugel et al. 2008 . It was reported that no WT-CSB , CPFP , or smaller CSB polypeptides were detected in these CS-B cells . Although it remains to analyze whether these CS-B patients had an abnor-mality in the repair of Top1-cc , given the potential for founder mutations in the native Reunion Island population Laugel et al. 2008 , it is possible that they have been homozygous for a mutation in a separate gene that , in combination with the absence of CSB , results in early onset CS features . It has been reported that CS-B cells are hypersen-sitive to treatment with H2O2 , whereas UVsS Kps3 cells exhibited normal resistance . Host cell reactiva-tion assay with lacZ expression plasmids containing the oxidative base lesions showed that CS-B cells are defective in recovery of expression , whereas UVsS cells show normal level of expression . In addition , repair of oxidative DNA damage is deficient in CS-A and CS-B cells Tuo et al. 2003 de Waard et al. 2004 Thorslund et al. 2005 Spivak Hanawalt 2006 Trapp et al. 2007 . It was recently shown that a UVsS patient UVs1VI has a mutation in the CSA gene and showed normal sensitivity to oxidative DNA damage , whereas CS-A patient’s cells are hypersensitive to oxidative stress Nardo et al. 2009 . Although the exact role of CSA and CSB in oxida-tive damage repair is not known , defective repair of Top1-cc and of oxidative DNA damage in CS cells are not mutually exclusive in fact , oxidative DNA lesions can cause Top1-cc .

Error bars represent the SD from the mean of three inde-pendent experiments . G CPFP-knockdown and control TelCOFS02MA CS-B cells were treated with 2 lM CPT for 6 h , and then incubated for 0 h no repair or 5 h after CPT treatment . ICE assay using different amounts of DNA 78–2500 ng was per-formed and the Top1-cc was measured by Western blotting of DNA-containing fractions with anti-Top1 antibody . Note that the amount of Top1-cc was saturated at 0 h after treatment with 2 lM CPT for 6 h , but the difference in the amount of Top1-cc between CPFP-knockdown and control CS-B cells became evident during incubation for 5 h after CPT treatment , indicating that CPFP inhibited a repair of CPT-induced Top1-cc . H Quantitative measurement of Top1-cc in G . Amount of Top1-cc was expressed after standardization of the amount of Top1-cc in 2500 ng DNA fraction derived from siLuc – no repair as 100 % .

21143560	305-8577 , Japan Introduction The Keap1-Nrf2 system plays a central role in the cel-lular defense against electrophilic and oxidative stresses by orchestrating gene expression of detoxifying and Communicated by Kohei Miyazono motifs of Nrf2 . Under basal conditions , Nrf2 is main-tained at low levels because of Keap1-dependent ubiq-uitination and proteasomal degradation . Upon exposure to electrophiles or oxidative stress , Nrf2 is stabilized and accumulates in the nucleus , where it transactivates ARE ? EpRE-regulated genes . A variety of Nrf2 activators have been reported Kobayashi Yamamoto 2005 . Some of these activa-tors have protective activities against carcinogenesis , neuronal damage and inflammation that can be ingested as dietary agents for the prevention and therapy of age-related diseases such as cancer , cardio-vascular diseases , chronic inflammation and neuro-degenerative diseases Calabrese et al. 2008 . However , positive roles of Nrf2 in cancer tumorigenesis and chemoresistance have recently been uncovered Hayes McMahon 2009 Lau et al. 2008 . It will be impor-tant to understand the differences between the Nrf2 activators , in particular the mechanisms of Keap1-Nrf2 activation , the activation of other systems and which Nrf2-target genes they induce . The new field has focused on the identification of sensor molecules that activate Nrf2 . These activators have a common ability to modify sulfhydryl groups by alkylation , oxidation or reduction . This observation suggests that cells possess a primary sensor for Nrf2 acti-vators that is equipped with highly reactive cysteine residues . Cys-151 of mouse Keap1 is a target site for many Nrf2 activators such as diethylmaleate DEM Kobayashi et al. 2009 Sekhar et al. 2010 . We recently found that cyclopentenone prostaglandins , 15d-PGJ2 and prostaglandin A2 PGA2 , target residues other than Cys-151 in Keap1 , perhaps Cys-273 Kobayashi et al. 2009 . Furthermore , sensor proteins for H2O2 , cad-mium chloride and gold-compound auranofin were not Keap1 or Nrf2 Kobayashi et al. 2009 . The target selections of a variety of Nrf2 activators should be investigated comprehensively . The Keap1-Nrf2 system is conserved among verte-brates , including zebrafish Kobayashi et al. 2002 Takagi et al. 2004 Li et al. 2008 . Among the known endogenous targets of zebrafish Nrf2 , the pi-class glutathione S-transferase 1 gene gstp1 showed the strongest induction in both electrophile-treated larvae and Nrf2-overexpressing embryos . The gene regula-tory region of gstp1 was examined by a green fluores-cent protein GFP reporter gene analysis using microinjection into zebrafish embryos , and an ARE ? EpRE-like sequence located 30 bp upstream of the transcription initiation site was shown to be necessary and sufficient for the induction by Nrf2 Suzuki et al. 2005 . In this study , we tried to generate stable transgenic zebrafish lines that express GFP in response to Nrf2 activators using a 3.5-kb gene regulatory region of gstp1 to develop a rapid and easy method for screen-ing and classifying Nrf2 activators . Two stable trans-genic lines that express GFP in the larval olfactory regions in response to Nrf2 activators were isolated . No GFP induction was detected in transgenic embryos , but strong induction in response to DEM and 15d-PGJ2 , but not H2O2 , was observed when both Nrf2 and Keap1 were overexpressed . Using this system , we classified a newly identified Nrf2 activa-tor , OA-NO2 , into the same category as 15d-PGJ2 . Generation of stable transgenic lines that express GFP in response to Nrf2 activators In transient assays , GFP expression from the p3.5gstp1 GFP construct , which contains a 3.5-kb promoter region of the zebrafish gstp1 gene , is strongly transacti-vated by Nrf2 in zebrafish embryos Fig. 1A Suzuki et al. 2005 . Stable transgenic lines carrying this con-struct were isolated by genotyping F1 embryos from p3.5gstp1GFP-injected founders . Although three stable lines were isolated , none of the three lines exhibited GFP expression upon treatment with DEM , thus suggesting a position effect of the transgene data not shown Table S1 in Supporting Information . To circumvent this problem , a highly efficient Tol2 trans-poson system Kawakami et al. 2004 was used to generate additional stable lines . A pT3.5gstp1GFP construct was made by introducing Tol2 sequences into p3.5gstp1GFP and were co-injected into zebrafish embryos with mRNA encoding Tol2-specific trans-posase . Injected founders n 104 were raised and 12 transgenic lines , which showed GFP expression in F1 larvae , were isolated Table S1 in Supporting Informa-tion . Out of 12 Tg -3.5gstp1 GFP lines , two lines exhibited GFP induction in response to DEM , and the rest displayed only basal GFP expression . In the larvae of these two lines it416a and it416b , strong GFP induction was observed in the olfactory regions as for endogenous gstp1 , whereas constitutive GFP expres-sion was also detected in the lens , ears , fins , pericar-dium and lateral lines Figs S1 and S2 in Supporting Information . We used the it416b line for further experiments because it exhibited stronger GFP induc-tion than the it416a line . In day 4 larvae , induction of endogenous gstp1 expression began approximately 3 h after DEM To quantify the level of the GFP expression , a fluores-cent intensity in the olfactory regions was measured using an imaging analyzer equipped with the BZ-8000 microscope Keyence Fig. 2A . The average fluores-cent intensities of DEM-induced GFP expression in the olfactory regions were measured using 3 , 10 or 30 individual larvae , and all of these showed similar values Fig. 2B . We therefore used three individuals for quantification of the GFP induction in further analy-ses . According to this quantification , the reduction in DEM-induced GFP expression by the nrf2-knock-down was calculated as one-third Fig. 2C . Quantification of reduced GFP induction in the it567 mutant larvae We have screened and isolated zebrafish mutants that have defects in gstp1 induction by Nrf2 activators Kobayashi et al. 2009 . One of these mutants , it567 , has reduced induction of gstp1 in response to DEM . To visualize this reduction in living larvae , we crossed it567 fish with Tg -3.5gstp1 GFP it416b fish . As expected , DEM-induced GFP expression in the olfac-tory regions of it567 homozygous larvae was signifi-cantly reduced compared to that of sibling wild-type larvae Fig. 3 Movie S2 in Supporting Information . The result indicates that homozygous mutant larvae are easily distinguishable from wild-type siblings by monitoring GFP induction upon treatment with DEM , although we have not identified the gene responsible for the it567 mutation . C E GFP induction by a variety of Nrf2 activators To elucidate whether Tg -3.5gstp1 GFP it416b can monitor the induction by a variety of Nrf2 activators , five Nrf2-activating compounds in different classes were examined Kobayashi et al. 2009 . Day 4 larvae of Tg -3.5gstp1 GFP it416b fish were treated with sul-foraphane , 15d-PGJ2 , H2O2 , auranofin or CdCl2 , and the GFP expression in the olfactory regions was mon-itored in three individuals Fig. 4A . GFP induction was observed in larvae treated with all tested Nrf2 activators , although it was a bit weaker upon induc-tion with H2O2 and CdCl2 . The results suggest that dpf . Tg -3.5gstp1 GFP it416b it567 ? it567 larvae or wild-type siblings were treated with 100 lM DEM for 6 h . Arrowheads indicate the olfactory regions . B Average fluorescence inten-sities of three individual larvae were analyzed . Error bars indi-cate the standard deviation values . DEM , diethylmaleate GFP , green fluorescent protein . Tg -3.5gstp1 GFP it416b can be used for the analysis of Nrf2 activator sensing mechanisms and also to screen for novel and unidentified activators . We recently classified eleven Nrf2 activators based on the requirement of these activators for an Nrf2 response Kobayashi et al. 2009 . The classification was carried out using zebrafish embryos overexpress-ing Nrf2 and Keap1 . The embryos were treated with each Nrf2 activator , and the induction of the endo-genous gstp1 gene was analyzed by a whole-mount in situ hybridization or by an RT-PCR analysis . It will be time-and labor-saving if Tg -3.5gstp1 GFP it416b can be used for this analysis . To test this possibility , Nrf2 was overexpressed by an mRNA injection in embryos obtained from crossing heterozygous trans-genic males and non-transgenic females and GFP expression was analyzed during gastrulation stages Fig . S3 in Supporting Information . Robust GFP Tg -3.5gstp1 GFP it416b embryos co-injected with wild-type WT or C151S Keap1 mRNA and Nrf2 mRNA were treated with Nrf2 activators for 6 h . GFP , green fluorescent protein . expression was observed in the embryos injected with Nrf2 mRNA , whereas no GFP expression was observed in uninjected embryos . We then generated homozygous transgenic lines to make all the injected embryos positive for GFP . Embryos obtained from homozygous transgenic males and non-transgenic females were used for the further analyses , because maternal GFP expression was observed in embryos derived from transgenic females data not shown . When wild-type or C151S mutant Keap1 was overexpressed with Nrf2 , no GFP expres-sion was observed , indicating that Keap1 suppressed GFP-inducing activity of Nrf2 Fig. 4B . Treatment of DEM canceled the Nrf2-suppression by wild-type Keap1 but not by C151S Keap1 , whereas 15d-PGJ2 released Nrf2 activity from both . H2O2 treatment had no effect at all . These results suggest that Keap1 is a sensor for DEM and 15d-PGJ2 , but not for H2O2 , and Cys-151 is required for DEM but not 15d-PGJ2 sens-ing . All these results were identical as in the case of the previous analyses conducted using endogenous gstp1 induction Kobayashi et al. 2009 . OA-NO2 activates Nrf2 as 15d-PGJ2 OA-NO2 was next analyzed as an uncharacterized Nrf2 activator using Tg -3.5gstp1 GFP it416b . OA - NO2 is a nitro-fatty acid that has been recently shown to activate Nrf2 Freeman et al. 2008 . Nitro-fatty acids are electrophilic fatty acids produced in vivo from nitrogen peroxide that have many physiological activi-ties , such as cGMP-dependent vessel relaxation , the inhibition of the inflammatory cell function , the induction of heme oxygenase 1 expression , the inhibi-tion of NFjB , peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor PPAR activation and Nrf2 activation . GFP expression in the olfactory regions of Tg -3.5gstp1 GFP it416b larvae was analyzed after treatment with OA-NO2 at 4 days postfertilization dpf Fig. 5A , B . A significant GFP induction was observed in the olfactory regions of OA-NO2-treated larvae and was decreased upon Nrf2 knockdown after injecting nrf2MO . GFP induction was also observed with OA-NO2 treatment of embryos overexpressing Nrf2 and Keap1 Fig. 5C . Significantly , the Keap1 C151S mutation could not eliminate this induction , suggest-ing that Cys-151 is not a sensing site for OA-NO2 in the Keap1-Nrf2 system . Identical results were obtained when the induction of endogenous gstp1 was analyzed by RT-PCR Fig. 5D . We also showed that a Cys-to-Ser mutation in Cys-288 , another key reac-tive cysteine in Keap1 , had no effect on the response to OA-NO2 Fig. S4 in Supporting Information . It must be noted that these are same results as in the case of 15d-PGJ2 Kobayashi et al. 2009 . To determine the sites in Keap1 modified by OA-NO2 , mouse Keap1 protein treated with or without A B C D OA-NO2-induced GFP expression in Tg -3.5gstp1 GFP it416b embryos . Tg -3.5gstp1 GFP it416b embryos were co-injected with wild-type WT or C151S Keap1 mRNA and Nrf2 mRNA were treated with 2.5 lM OA-NO2 for 6 h . D An RT-PCR analysis of OA-NO2-induced endogenous gstp1 expression . Embryos co-injected with wild-type WT or C151S Keap1 mRNA and Nrf2 mRNA were treated with 2.5 lM OA-NO2 for 6 h . GFP , green fluorescent protein . OA-NO2 was digested with trypsin and analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry MALDI-TOF MS . Peptide mass mapping by an MALDI-TOF MS analysis of the trypsin fragments of native mouse Keap1 made it possible to identify the peptides , thus accounting for approximately 80 % of the protein sequence see Table S2 in the Supporting Information . Compared with the calculated masses of the unmodified peptides , modified peptides P-1 to P-6 had an increased mass of +327.4 Da , thus corresponding to the addition of a sin-gle equivalent of OA-NO2 Fig. 6 . The sequences and masses of the peptides were as follows P-1 CHAL-TPR , m ? z 1124.8 , P-2 SGVGVAVTMEPCR , m ? z 1632.7 , P-3 LNSAECYYPER , m ? z 1671.7 , P-4 LSQQLCDVTLQVK , m ? z 1802.1 , P-5 SGL AGCVVGGLLYAVGGR , m ? z 1976.2 and P-6 QEEFFNLSHCQLATLISR , m ? z 2463.3 , indicat-ing that mouse Keap1 is modified by OA-NO2 at Cys-77 , Cys-226 , Cys-273 , Cys-368 , Cys-489 and Cys-613 . It should be noted that Cys-273 was included in the amino acids to which 15d-PGJ2 and PGA2 were shown to bind in our previous analyses Fig. 6B Kobayashi et al. 2009 . Another criterion of the classification is dependency to it275 gene . it275 is a zebrafish mutant , which has defects in the response to some , but not all , Nrf2 acti-vators . For example , induction of endogenous gstp1 was decreased in it275 larvae in response to 15d-PGJ2 , auranofin and CdCl2 and was similar with wild-type larvae in response to DEM , sulforaphane and H2O2 . gstp1 expression was analyzed in it275 larvae or sibling wild-type larvae with or without OA-NO2 treatment at 4 dpf by an in situ hybridization Fig. 7 . OA-NO2-dependent gstp1 induction in gills or olfactory regions was dramatically reduced in it275 larvae compared to wild-type larvae . The reduction was not observed in larvae treated with DEM . This result suggests that Nrf2 activation mediated by OA-NO2 requires the it275 gene , which is also similar to 15d-PGJ2 . Taken together , OA-NO2 was classified as a class 4 Nrf2 activator , as are 15d-PGJ2 and PGA2 Kobay-ashi et al. 2009 . We thus hypothesize that nitro-fatty acids and cyclopentenone prostaglandins share strate-gies to activate the Keap1-Nrf2 system . Discussion We previously demonstrated that nitrolinoleic acid LNO2 , a nitro-fatty acid similar to OA-NO2 , also activates Nrf2 in cultured cells Villacorta et al. 2007 . The present study verifies that nitro-fatty acids are indeed effective Nrf2 activators in living animals . The covalent binding of OA-NO2 with reactive cysteines and histidines has been demonstrated previously in a variety of proteins Batthyany et al. 2006 . It is quite possible that OA-NO2 directly binds Keap1 , most likely at Cys-273 . Importantly , OA-NO2 appears to belong to the same Nrf2 activator class as 15d-PGJ2 as we have described herein . Strikingly , the chemical structures of nitro-fatty acids OA-NO2 and LNO2 and cyclopentenone prostaglandins 15d-PGJ2 and PGA2 are similar Fig. 8A . We speculate that unique structures common between these compounds are essential for targeting identical sites in the Keap1 pro-tein . Besides activating Nrf2 , nitro-fatty acids can activate PPARc as an endogenous ligand with cova-lent binding to Cys-285 Schopfer et al. 2005 , 2010 and can inhibit NFjB-DNA binding through direct A B interaction with p65 Cui et al. 2006 . Interestingly , 15d-PGJ2 also exhibits these properties via direct binding to PPARc at Cys-285 Shiraki et al. 2006 and p65 of NFjB at Cys-38 Straus et al. 2000 . It is plausible that OA-NO2 can also bind to Cys-38 of NFjB p65 . We hypothesize that electrophilic signal-ing compounds , such as nitro-fatty acids and cyclo-pentenone prostaglandins , can bind to a series of key target proteins e.g. , Keap1 , PPARc and NFjB and thereby exert their physiological functions for exam-ple , anti-inflammatory effects by the combined actions of their target proteins Fig. 8B the cysteine code hypothesis , Kobayashi et al. 2009 . The Tg -3.5gstp1 GFP it416b line established in the current study can monitor electrophile-induced gene expression in vivo and will be useful for many situa-tions , for example in gene analyses , small-molecule screens and mutant fish screens . Generation of real-time monitoring systems of electrophile-induced Nrf2 activation has been studied for many years . Stable cell lines that can monitor Nrf2 activation were previously produced using multiple ARE ? EpRE sequences as transcriptional drivers and GFP or luciferase as reporter genes Zhu Fahl 2001 Wang et al. 2006 . The results obtained by use of these cell lines are reproduc-ible and are more reliable than experiments relying on transient transfection . Transgenic mice , which have luciferase reporter genes fused to multiple ARE ? EpRE sequences , were also generated Yates et al. 2007 Fisher et al. 2007 . These transgenic mice are useful because they can allow the monitoring of tissue-and developmental stage-specific profiles of Nrf2 activa-tion . Real-time activation of Nrf2 in disease models can also be analyzed by crossing these mice with a variety of gene-disrupted mice . However , this model has shortcomings , in that administration of the sub-strate luciferin into mice is required , whose disposition and side effects might affect the proper analysis of results . The use of GFP instead of luciferase will be helpful to overcome this problem however , it is diffi-cult to analyze GFP expression in the internal regions of a mouse . Trials to generate stable transgenic zebra-fish that harbor ARE ? EpRE-driven GFP reporter gene have been carried out Carvan et al. 2000 Kusik et al. 2008 but were unsuccessful . Tg -3.5gstp1 GFP it416b is the first ARE ? EpRE-GFP reporter line that can be used to monitor Nrf2 activation at a practi-cal and physiologically relevant level . Our success was attributed to a screen of effective lines from substantial numbers of stable transgenic lines . In that sense , the use of the Tol2 transposon system was an important strategy which greatly improved the transgene integra-tion efficiency Kawakami 2007 . At the onset of this study , we hoped to establish transgenic lines that can analyze tissue-specific differ-ences in GFP induction upon induction by a variety of Nrf2 activators . Unfortunately , this method did not succeed . GFP induction in gills and livers , in which endogenous gstp1 was induced in addition to the olfactory regions , was not observed in the present lines . We supposed that cis-and trans-activating factors required for gstp1 induction differ between tissues . Indeed , cell-specific differences in the induction levels of the ARE ? EpRE reporter gene have been demon-strated using cultured cell lines Wang et al. 2006 . Gene regulatory elements required for the expression in gills and liver other than ARE ? EpRE sequences may not be included in the 3.5-kb gstp1 region . The negative and positive roles of Nrf2 in human health have both been recently demonstrated Hayes McMahon 2009 Lau et al. 2008 . It will be important to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of the cell-specific induction of Nrf2 target genes , particularly in cancer cells . Modified bacterial artificial chromosomes for transgenesis will be useful to identify cis-activating factors for cell specificity Yang et al. 2009 . The zebrafish is an attractive model for analyzing gene expression profiles because it has transparent embryos and larvae . Moreover , a transparent adult line , termed casper , has been recently generated White et al. 2008 . Thus , utilizing a GFP reporter will facilitate the visualization of a variety of stress responses in living animals . Indeed , cellular responses to metals , such as cadmium , copper and arsenate , were monitored in GFP transgenic zebrafish using heat shock promoters Blechinger et al. 2007 Wu et al. 2008 Seok et al . 2007 . GFP induction by environmental estrogens and dioxin was also analyzed by GFP transgenic zebrafish using estrogen response elements + vitellogenin pro-moter Chen et al. 2010 and cytochrome P4501A1 pro-moter Mattingly et al. 2001 , respectively , as transcriptional drivers . The zebrafish provides oppor-tunities to accelerate the process of drug discovery Zon Peterson 2005 . These GFP transgenic lines , including Tg -3.5gspt1 GFP it416b , will contribute to several aspects of the drug development process , including target identification by genetic and morpho-lino oligonucleotide screens , lead discovery by small-molecule screens and the testing of drug efficacy and toxicity . The application of Tg -3.5gspt1 GFP it416b to screen novel Nrf2 activators and inhibitors will be therefore be pursued in future studies . Experimental procedures Zebrafish Embryos and larvae were obtained by natural mating . The wild-type strain AB and the mutant strain it567 Kobayashi et al. 2009 were used . The stable transgenic lines Tg -3.5gstp1 GFP it416a and Tg -3.5gstp1 GFP it416b were maintained as homozygous lines . Homozygous transgenic lines were crossed with the AB strain to obtain embryos and larvae for experi-ments . The genotyping of transgenic lines was carried out by PCR using genomic DNA as templates and the primers 5¢-CCTCGTGACCACCCTGAC-3¢ and 5¢-TGGCGGATC TTGAAGTTCAC-3¢ . The transgenic line , Tg -3.5gstp1 GFP it416b , can be obtained upon request under the support of Zebrafish National Bioresource Project of Japan http www.shigen.nig.ac.jp zebra index_en.html . Chemical treatments For the induction studies , zebrafish were placed in culture dishes containing 100 lM DEM Wako , Osaka , Japan , 40 lM sulforaphane LKT laboratories , St. Paul , MN , 2.5 lM 15d-PGJ2 Cayman Chemical , Ann Arbor , MI , 1 lM auranofin Enzo Life Sciences , Farmingdale , NY , 1 mM H2O2 Wako , 20 lM CdCl2 Wako and 1.5 or 2.5 lM OA-NO2 . OA-NO2 was prepared as previously described Baker et al. 2005 . Plasmids pT3.5gstp1GFP was generated by replacing the Xenopus EF1a enhancer ? promoter region in pT2KXIG Kawakami et al. 2004 with a XhoI-NotI fragment of p3.5gstp1GFP Suzuki et al. 2005 . The construct was verified by DNA sequencing . Plasmids pCS2nrf2 , pCS2FLmKeap1 , pCS2FLmKeap1C151S , pCS2FLmKeap1C288S , pKSgstp1N and pCS-TP were described previously Kobayashi et al. 2002 , 2009 Kawakami et al. 2004 . Microinjection For the overexpression of Nrf2 and Keap1 proteins , synthetic capped mRNA was generated with an SP6 mMESSAGE mMACHINE in vitro transcription kit Ambion , Austin , TX using linearized DNA of the pCS2 derivatives described above and injected into yolk at the one-cell stage using an IM300 microinjector Narishige , Tokyo , Japan . For knocking-down zebrafish Nrf2 nrf2 , antisense morpholino oligonucleotides Gene Tools , Philomath , OR specific for nrf2 nrf2MO Kobayashi et al. 2002 were injected into yolk at the one-cell stage . For generating stable transgenic lines , 25 pg of pT3.5gstp1GFP or p3.5gstpGFP was co-injected into a blasto-mere of early one-cell stage embryos with 25 pg of Tol2-trans-posase mRNA synthesized from NotI-linearized pCS-TP as previously described Takeuchi et al. 2010 . Expression analysis GFP expression during various embryonic stages was exam-ined under a GFP2 480 nm excitation , 510 nm barrier filter of a MZFLIII microscope Leica , Wetzler , Germany equipped with a 600CL-CU digital camera Pixera Los Galos , CA . GFP expression during larval stages was analyzed under a GFP-BP BZ filter 470 nm excitation , 535 nm emission of a Biozero BZ-8000 microscope Keyence , Osaka , Japan . For taking time-lapse photographs , larvae were anesthetized with 0.016 % 3-aminobenzoic acid ethyl ester Sigma-Aldrich , St. Louis , MO and placed on a hole slide glass containing 3 % methylcellulose Sigma Aldrich for immobilization . To quan-tify GFP expression , fluorescence intensity in the olfactory regions was measured by an image processing system equipped with the BZ-8000 microscope . The gene expres-sions of endogenous gstp1 were examined by an in situ hybridization analysis , a RT-PCR analysis or a real-time RT-PCR analysis , as previously described Li et al. 2008 Kobay-ashi et al. 2001 . MALDI-TOF MS analysis The recombinant mouse Keap1 protein expressed by Escherichia coli was incubated with or without 100 lM OA-NO2 for 60 min at 25 ? C in buffer containing 20 mM Tris–HCl , pH 8.5 . The trypsin-digested mouse Keap1 was mixed with dith-iothreitol and trifluoroacetic acid . To improve the ionization efficiency of MS , samples were purified with Zip-tip lC18 Millipore , Bedford , MA before MS analysis . Peptides were mixed with a-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid 2.5 mg ? ml containing 50 % acetonitrile and 0.1 % trifluoroacetic acid and dried on stainless steel targets at room temperature . The analyses were carried out using an AXIMA-TOF2 Shimadzu , Tokyo , Japan with a nitrogen laser .

21143562	Introduction The Sir2 family of protein deacetylases sirtuins are nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide + –dependent enzymes that mediate lifespan extension in yeasts , nematodes and Drosophila by calorie restriction Hai-gis Guarente 2006 . Seven sirtuins SIRT1-7 have been identified in mammals . SIRT1 and SIRT6 are localized in the nucleus SIRT2 in the cytoplasm SIRT3 , SIRT4 and SIRT5 in the mitochondria and SIRT7 in the nucleolus North Verdin 2004 Michishita et al. 2005 . Among the cellular organelles , mitochondria are closely associated with cell senes-cence . It generates reactive oxygen species as a by-product of ATP synthesis . Of the seven sirtuins , SIRT3 and SIRT4 , respectively , utilize acetyl CoA synthetase and glutamate dehydrogenase as a substrate , Communicated by Keiji Tanaka for the recognition and degradation of denaturated proteins is endoplasmic reticulum–associated degrada-tion . This mechanism greatly varies from intramitoc-hondrial protein quality control in that denaturated proteins are degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome system through retrograde transport into the cyto-plasm Nakatsukasa Brodsky 2008 . Recent studies have suggested a mechanism for degrading mitochon-drial proteins by proteasome through retrograde trans-port into the cytoplasm Margineantu et al. 2007 Radke et al. 2008 Azzu Brand 2010 . In agree-ment with this mechanism , we previously reported that MITOL , a novel mitochondrial ubiquitin ligase , plays an important role in the quality control of mito-chondrial proteins Yonashiro et al. 2006 Sugiura et al. 2010 . However , the molecules involved in the selection mechanism of proteins to be transported remain to be elucidated . In this study , we clarified the regulation mecha-nism of mitochondrial localization of SIRT5 isoforms via their C-terminal functions . We examined two SIRT5 isoforms that are encoded by the human SIRT5 gene . We distinguished the intracellular local-izations of these two isoforms based on the difference in their degradation process and factors preventing their degradation . Based on our findings , we suggest that the functional diversity of SIRT5 is because of its two isoforms , SIRT5iso1 and SIRT5iso2 , as well as its possible primate-specific functions . Results Two SIRT5 isoforms exhibit different intracellular localizations SIRT5iso1 and SIRT5iso2 are two isoforms of SIRT5 which are generated by alternative splicing . Both iso-forms are encoded by the human SIRT5 gene Fig. 1A Mahlknecht et al. 2006 . SIRT5iso1 and SIRT5iso2 show a common primary structure in most regions including the N-terminus and the evolution-arily conserved Sir2 core domain . However , SIRT5iso1 has 25 amino acid residues at the C-termini , whereas SIRT5iso2 has 14 . Based on this difference , the localization of SIRT5 isoforms in mammalian cells was examined . SIRT5iso1 was found to localize in the nucleus or cytoplasm . There were no cells showing only mitochondrial localization of SIRT5iso1 Fig. 1B . However , the shorter isoform SIRT5iso2 showed predominant mitochondrial localization . SIRT5DC , which is composed of only the common regions of SIRT5iso1 and SIRT5iso2 , exhibited SIRT5iso2-like A B mitochondrial localization , suggesting that SIRT5iso1 and SIRT5iso2 potentially show mitochondrial locali-zation owing to their common primary structure . Although the potential artifacts by attachment of GFP to the C-terminus of SIRT5 should be considered , the SIRT5iso1-specific C-terminus appears to allow the nuclear or cytoplasmic localization of SIRT5iso1 . Many mitochondrial proteins encoded in the nucleus are generated as a precursor protein containing the mitochondrial targeting signal MTS at their N-terminus . MTS is rich in basic amino acid or Ser ? Thr residues and can form amphipathic helix structure . These characteristics were also found in the N-terminus of SIRT5 Fig. 2A , B . To determine whether the N-terminus of SIRT5 functions as MTS , we examined the localization of an SIRT5 N-termi-nus–EGFP fusion protein in mammalian cells . We found that the majority of EGFP was independently localized in the cytoplasm or nucleus . This was also true for N1–36-EGFP , which was formed by the fusion of 36 amino acids of the SIRT5 N-terminal and EGFP Fig. 2C . However , mitochondrial trans-location of EGFP was observed in N1–72-EGFP , which contains the region in which amphipathic helix formation is expected . A precursor protein with the N-terminal MTS is generally MTS-dependently transported into the mitochondria and becomes a mature form after MTS cleavage by matrix-located mitochondrial processing peptidase MPP Pfanner Geissler 2001 . Several motifs that are recognized and cleaved by MPP have been identified Gakh et al. 2002 . The R-2 motif [ XRXS S ? X ] , an MPP cleavage motif , was specifi-cally found at the N-terminus of SIRT5 , suggesting cleavage at this terminus Fig. 2A . To clarify whether SIRT5 underwent cleavage at its N-terminus , SIRT5 that is fused to a FLAG and Myc tag at both termini was expressed in mammalian cells to observe the sig-nal of each epitope tag on Western blotting . The form with both termini retained FL and the form with higher mobility DN , which can be detected only with the Myc tag at the C-terminus , were detected in both SIRT5iso1 and SIRT5iso2 Fig. 2D . This result indicates that SIRT5 contains a cleavable presequence at its N-terminus and that an exposed native N-terminus is necessary for its complete cleav-age . Several previous studies have shown that a posi-tive charge , which is one of the characteristics of MTS , is required for ‘‘electrophoretic’’ transport into the matrix across the mitochondrial inner membrane Martin et al. 1991 Truscott et al. 2001 . Accumula-tion of non-cleaved FLAG-SIRT5-Myc may be attributed to the FLAG epitope that contains many negatively charged amino acid residues . In support of this notion , the non-cleaved FLAG-SIRT5-Myc was found not only in the cytoplasm but also in the mito-chondrial fraction data not shown . These results indicate that the SIRT5 N-terminus functions as a cleavable MTS which contains a mitochondrial matrix–targeting signal . We examined the localization of each SIRT5 isoform lacking 72 N-terminal amino acids and SIRT5DC in mammalian cells to determine whether N-terminal MTS is required for the mitochondrial localization of SIRT5 Fig. 3A . SIRT5iso1 , SIRT5iso2 and SIRT5DC that were fused to a FLAG tag at each C-terminus exhibited the same intracellular localization as that of SIRT5–EGFP Fig. 1 data not shown . Further-more , the mitochondrial localization of SIRT5iso1 dis-appeared because of the deletion of the N-terminus which functions as MTS Fig. 3B . Similar results were also observed with SIRT5DC , indicating that N-terminal MTS is necessary for the mitochondrial localization of SIRT5 . Surprisingly , SIRT5iso2 exhib-ited mitochondrial localization despite of MTS dele-tion at its N-terminus . This finding suggests that SIRT5iso2 contains MTS not only at its N-terminus but also potentially at its C-terminus . These results indicate that the N-terminus and C-terminus of SIRT5 , which sandwich the Sir2 core domain , are involved in the intracellular localization of SIRT5 . The C-terminal region particularly contains informa-tive features that characterize the intracellular localiza-tion of each SIRT5 isoform . Similar to SIRT5iso1 , several proteins exhibiting cleav-age of N-terminal MTS are found in the cytoplasm . PINK1 , a gene product of PARK6 which is the causa-tive gene of familial Parkinson’s disease , is one of these proteins Beilina et al. 2005 Silvestri et al. 2005 . PINK1 binds to chaperones Hsp90 ? Cdc37 localized in the cytoplasm to regulate its stability and mitochondrial localization Lin Kang 2008 Moriwaki et al. 2008 Weihofen et al. 2008 . From this background , the rela-tionship between the stability of SIRT5 in the cyto-plasm ? mitochondria and the mitochondrial localization of SIRT5 was investigated using cycloheximide CHX , a protein synthesis inhibitor Fig. 4A–C . A B Compared with SIRT5iso1 , which is stably localized in the mitochondria and cytoplasm , SIRT5iso2 was rapidly degraded in the cytoplasm . Similar to SIRT5 iso2– FLAG , SIRT5iso2–EGFP was also rapidly degraded in the cytoplasm not shown . As immunostaining analysis failed to detect the cytosolic SIRT5iso2 Fig. 1B , some modifications may occur on cytosolic SIRT5iso2 , which induces conformational change . SIRT5DC exhibited instability in both the mitochondria and cytoplasm , suggesting that the SIRT5iso1 C-terminus inhibits the degradation of both cytosolic and mito - A B C D E chondrial SIRT5 and that the SIRT5iso2 C-terminus inhibits the degradation of mitochondrial SIRT5 . Taken together , these results indicate that the differ-ence in the intracellular localization between SIRT5iso1 and SIRT5iso2 is influenced by the stability of each isoform in the cytoplasm . Because the cytoplasmic instability of both isoforms was partially recovered by the addition of MG132 , a proteasome inhibitor Fig. 4D , the ubiquitin-proteasome degradation system was spec-ulated to be involved in such recovery . Stabilized proteins are accumulated in both the cytosol and the mitochondria not shown . The ubiquitination of each SIRT5 isoform showed that proteasome inhibition by MG132 induced the accumulation of polyubiquitinated SIRT5iso2 . However , polyubiquitination of SIRT5iso1 was not observed even in the presence of proteasome inhibitor Fig. 4E . As SIRT5DC showed the same polyubiquitination as that of SIRT5iso2 , the SIRT5iso1 C-terminus is suggested to inhibit polyubiquitination to prevent the degradation of SIRT5iso1 by protea-some , resulting in its stable cytoplasmic localization . Subsequent investigation into the common primary structure of SIRT5iso1 and PINK1 identified 4 amino acid residues Gly-Pro-Cys-Gly , GPCG-motif that are commonly located at the SIRT5iso1-specific C-terminus and PINK1 N-terminus Fig. 5A . To determine the relationship between SIRT5iso1-specific properties and the newly identified GPCG-motif , we examined the cytoplasmic localization and stability of SIRT5iso1 lacking these four amino acid residues . Immunostaining analysis showed that DGPCG-SIRT5iso1 predominantly localized to the mitochon-dria similarly to SIRT5iso2 Fig. 5B . Similar to SIRT5iso2 , some modifications may occur on cytosolic DGPCG-SIRT5iso1 . Analysis of cytoplasmic stability using CHX showed a similar instability of DGPCG-SIRT5iso1 Fig. 5C . The cytoplasmic instability of DGPCG-SIRT5iso1 was recovered by the addition of MG132 similarly to SIRT5iso2 Fig. 5D . Further-more , there was an accumulation of polyubiquitinated DGPCG-SIRT5iso1 because of proteasome inhibition by MG132 Fig. 5E . These findings showed that the ubiquitination-preventing ? stabilization signal in the cytoplasm , which was expected to be located at the SIRT5iso1 C-terminus , contains the GPCG-motif common to both SIRT5iso1 and PINK1 . Similar verification was also performed for the GPCG-motif in PINK1 . PINK1 is present in mam-malian cells as a non-cleaved form FL and an N-ter-minus cleaved form DN fractionation of these cells , in which wild-type PINK1 and DGPCG-PINK1 were transiently expressed , respectively , confirmed a marked accumulation of the FL form and DN form in the mitochondrial fraction Fig. S1A in supporting information . Because this fraction also contains endo-plasmic reticulum–derived microsomes , co-expression of DsRed-Mito and DsRed-ER was performed to determine the specific organelle where the accumula-tion occurred Fig. S1B in supporting information . For wild-type PINK1 , no significant colocalization was observed in the mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum . The majority of wild-type PINK1 was randomly distributed in the cytoplasm . Although the majority of DGPCG-PINK1 was also randomly dis-tributed in the cytoplasm , its partial colocalization between both organelles was more enhanced than that of wild-type PINK1 Fig. S1C in supporting information . These results indicate that the GPCG-motif in PINK1 performs a certain function during the transport of PINK1 between the cytoplasm and the organelles . SIRT5iso2 C-terminus functions as a mitochondrial membrane insertion signal To determine whether the SIRT5iso2 C-terminus functions as MTS , we examined the intracellular localization of EGFP proteins i.e. , EGFP-Ciso1 and EGFP-Ciso2 that are fused to each of the SIRT5 iso-forms Fig. 6A . EGFP-Ciso1 exhibited the same localization as that of EGFP , whereas EGFP-Ciso2 showed colocalization with DsRed-Mito . This indi-cates that the SIRT5iso2 C-terminus can function as MTS for mitochondrial translocation Fig. 6B . To elucidate the functional difference between the MTS located at the N-terminus and the MTS found at the SIRT5iso2 C-terminus , we examined the pri-mary structure of the SIRT5iso2 C-terminus . We found that the MTS located at the N-terminus showed a typical composition rich in basic amino acid residues , whereas the MTS found in the SIRT5iso2 C-terminus was rich in hydrophobic amino acids , showing a strong hydrophobic property Figs 1A and 6B . A homology search using the C-terminal 14 amino acids as query found high homology with the Helicobacter hepaticus MotA protein Fig. 6C . A B C D Although MotA is a four-pass transmembrane protein primarily composing bacterial flagella Sharp et al. 1995 , high homology with SIRT5iso2 was found within the second transmembrane domain . Further-more , a similar homology was also observed in the transmembrane domains of several proteins other than MotA . To confirm whether the SIRT5iso2 C-termi-nus functions as a transmembrane domain , the pres-ence or absence of insertion into the mitochondrial membrane was confirmed by alkali extraction after mitochondrial isolation from cells in which each SIRT5 isoform and a terminal deleted mutein are expressed . SIRT5iso1 was obtained as a soluble frac-tion , whereas SIRT5iso2 was obtained as an insoluble or membrane fraction Fig. 6D . Interestingly , SIRT5iso2-myc was suggested to localize in the mito-chondrial outer membrane Fig . 6E . Moreover , a similar result was observed in DM-SIRT5iso2-FLAG and EGFP-Ciso2 data not shown . These results indi-cate that the SIRT5iso2-specific C-terminus is a mito-chondrial membrane insertion signal . Interestingly , only cells that strongly expressed DsRed-Mito showed the colocalization of EGFP-Ciso2 in the mitochondria data not shown . This phenomenon was not observed in EGFP or EGFP-Ciso1 . This suggests that the SIRT5iso2 C-terminus exhibits affinity for the MTS of cytochrome oxidase subunit VIII that comprises DsRed-Mito or DsRed , or the mitochondria that exhibits abnormal protein accumulation . However , the mitochondrial fission factor hFis1 is a C-terminal anchored protein that induces mitochondrial translocation and insertion into the outer membrane in a C-terminal hydrophobic region-dependent manner Mozdy et al. 2000 . A recent study has indicated that the hFis1-induced mitochondrial translocation is not dependent on the TOM complex , which is associated with the mito-chondrial translocation and import of many mito-chondrial proteins . Instead , such translocation is heavily dependent on a mitochondrial membrane component Kemper et al. 2008 . Similar findings have been obtained for Bax and tBid , which are both involved in cytochrome c release during apoptosis Lutter et al. 2000 Sani et al. 2009 . The mitochon-drial localization of EGFP-Ciso2 was observed only in cells co-expressing DsRed-Mito . This may be caused by alterations in the regional composition and struc-ture of the mitochondrial membrane because of involves the retrograde transport of the GPCG-motif from the mitochondria to the cytoplasm . However , PINK1 accumulation occurs both in its uncleaved and in its cleaved states in the mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum . This indicates that the GPCG-motif may be broadly related to the transport of PINK1 across an organelle membrane . Although the functions of the GPCG-motif were partly clarified in the present study , additional studies are necessary to elucidate its other functions within the scope of the protein transport mechanism between the cyto-plasm and cytoplasmic organelles e.g . mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum . The SIRT5iso2 C-terminus was found to be a mitochondrial membrane insertion signal that also conditionally functions as potential MTS . In addition to hFis1 , Bcl-2 or some TOM complex-composing proteins contain the necessary and sufficient hydro-phobic domain at their C-terminus for mitochondrial translocation . All of these proteins are C-terminal anchored proteins inserted into the mitochondrial outer membrane on their C-terminal side Nguyen et al. 1993 Egan et al. 1999 Allen et al. 2002 Beil - harz et al. 2003 . Thus , the majority of the molecules of these proteins are exposed toward the cytoplasmic side of organelles . Interactions with proteins localized in the cytoplasm or proteins inserted into the mito-chondrial outer membrane occur in the hydrophobic domain at the C-terminus . The C-terminus-depen-dent mitochondrial localization of SIRT5iso2 lacking the N-terminal MTS indicates that SIRT5iso2 may have a physiologically similar insertion mode or topology in which the catalytic domain is oriented toward the cytoplasmic face . However , these mito-chondrial translocations can also be assumed as non-physiological phenomena brought about by the chemical properties of the hydrophobic domain Blo-bel 1980 Borgese et al. 2003 . Moreover , owing to the cleavage of the N-terminal presequences and given that SIRT5iso2 is translocated to the matrix , the insertion of the C-terminal domain into the inner or outer membrane is expected to result in exposure of each catalytic site toward the matrix face or the face of the intermembranous space , respectively . To fur-ther elucidate the function of SIRT5iso2 in the mito-chondria , it is necessary to understand the mechanism of its release to the cytoplasm and degradation by proteasome or the contradictory phenomena of its insertion into the mitochondrial membrane . In comparison with the base sequences of the SIRT5 gene locus in mammals , the exon characteriz-ing the SIRT5iso2-specific C-terminus was shown to be highly conserved in primates . Although similar base sequences are present in nonprimates including mouse , rat , horse and dog , such sequences were con-sidered to be unlikely to encode an SIRT5iso1-like transcript as an exon . Interestingly , SIRT5iso1 and SIRT5iso2 mRNA in humans contains not only dif-ferent C-termini of the coding region but also various untranslated regions that are different from each other , namely 5¢-UTR and 3¢-UTR Mahlknecht et al. 2006 . This finding suggests that SIRT5iso1 and SIRT5iso2 are controlled by different regulatory mechanisms at the transcriptional and translational levels . Although a high transcriptional level of SRIT5 has been reported in mouse lacking 5-HT1B receptors Sibille et al. 2007 , such mouse shows affective disor-ders such as a decrease in measures of anxiety in an elevated plus maze or open field test and increased aggression in the resident intruder paradigm Hoyer et al. 2002 . Although the relationship between these phenotypes and SIRT5 remains speculative , an attrac-tive hypothesis is that SIRT5iso2 , which was newly identified in primates , is related to the primate-spe-cific complexity of affectivity and other characteristics via a mitochondrial function . As SIRT3 and SIRT4 , which are also found in the mitochondria , are associ-ated with ATP production , SIRT5 is also considered to be involved in energy metabolism in addition to regulation of urea cycle . Glucose consumption is minimized in peripheral tissues to conserve glucose . This ensures glucose supply to the brain under calorie-restricted conditions e.g . sirtuin-activatable conditions Weindruch Walford 1988 . Therefore , each tissue in a primate’s brain would require the pri-mate-specific mitochondrial function of SIRT5 to meet the larger amount of energy needed because of the larger volume of each tissue . Experimental procedures Plasmid construction For the cloning of cDNA coding human SIRT5 , total RNA was isolated from HeLa cells and reverse-transcribed using the SuperScript One-Step RT-PCR system with Platinum Taq Invitrogen according to the manufacturer’s protocol . Full-length and partial cDNAs of SIRT5 were obtained by poly-merase chain reaction and subcloned into the pEGFP-N1 , pEGFP-C1 Clonthech and pcDNA3.1 ? Myc-His Invitrogen vectors .

Upregulated and downregulated miRNAs have been found in different malignancies , implicat-ing miRNAs as oncogenes or tumor suppressors.1 The increasing body of evidence for miRNA involvement in tumorigenesis has prompted the search in cancer-associated genomic regions for miRNA loci.2 In a deletion region at 13q14 , miR-15 and miR-16 , are downregulated in B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia . Both miR-15 and miR-16 negatively regulate BCL2 and positively regulate apoptosis , which could explain their frequent inactivation in leukemia.3 Later , miR-34a at 1p36 emerged as a tumor suppressor gene TSG . Several independent studies demonstrated anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic potential of miR-34a.4,5 The potential for involvement of as yet unreported miRNAs in cancer pathogenesis is great . Neural crest-derived neuroblastoma , one of the most common solid tumors in children , is frequently characterized as an ‘enigmatic neoplasm’ . Neuroblastoma has the highest rate of spontaneous regression of all human malignancies , however , B40 % of neuroblastomas rapidly progress despite multimodal treatment regimes.6,7 TP53 mutations are rare in neuroblastoma , which very often retain functional p53 , suggesting that inhibitors of the p53 pathway or loss of p53 pathway positive regulators may be involved in neutralizing p53 activity.8,9 Neuroblastomas with poor outcome are subdivided into at least two biologically distinct groups , either with or without amplification of the MYCN oncogene . The second group frequently harbors segmental 3p deletions , 10 implying that neuroblastoma-suppressive transcripts are encoded from this region . Several efforts have been made to map and refine the critical region of 3p loss in neuroblas-toma , currently assigned to 3p25-26.2 , including the VHL gene . Low VHL mRNA expression correlated with poor prognosis , however , functional analyses could not reveal differences in pVHL protein expression or pVHL pathway impairment.11 To date , the identity of neuroblastoma-relevant tumor suppressor genes TSGs at 3p25-26.2 is unknown . We detected several known and novel miRNA loci within regions of neuroblastoma-relevant chromosomal aberrations in pre-vious work.12 The only miRNA mapping to 3p25.3 is miR-885-5p . In this study , we show that miR-885-5p interferes with cell proliferation and survival , and promotes cellular sene-scence and apoptosis . We demonstrate that miR-885-5p downregulates cyclin-dependent kinase CDK2 and mini-chromosome maintenance protein MCM5 , activates p53 , and provide evidence that CDK2 and MCM5 are direct miR-885-5p targets . Our results suggest a tumor suppressive role for miR-885-5p in neuroblastoma . Results Low miR-885-5p expression in primary neuroblastomas with segmental 3p loss . In our previous work charac-terizing the neuroblastoma miRNA transcriptome , we cloned miR-885-5p MYCNSC_5_281 from a favorable tumor . miR-885-5p is a non-conserved miRNA , with no mouse or rat homologs Supplementary Figure S1a . To evaluate rearrangements of the region encompassing miR-885-5p in primary neuroblastomas , we used array-based comparative genomic hybridization aCGH to analyze 193 neuroblastomas with different clinical and biological characteristics . The 3p25.3 region encompassing miR-885-5p was heterozygously deleted in the context of a segmental chromosomal 3p loss in 14 % n ? 27 of tumors Figure 1a . Most 3p-deleted tumors were stage 4 n ? 17 . These data are consistent with previous reports on 3p25.3 status in neuroblastoma.10 We profiled miR-885-5p expression by RT-qPCR in 60 primary neuroblastomas . For comparison , we profiled miR-331-3p , a miRNA possibly repressed by MYCN with tumor suppressive functions according to our previous data.12 Assuming equal Cq-values for similar ex-pression levels , miR-885-5p expression was lower than miR-331-3p in neuroblastomas Figure 1b . No significant difference in miR-885-5p expression was detected between neuroblastomas with and without MYCN amplification , whereas miR-331-3p expression was lower in MYCN-amplified neuroblastomas Po0.001 , Figure 1b . Intriguingly , miR-885-5p expression was lower in aggressive tumors with segmental 3p deletions , as compared with those with intact 3p and favorable prognosis P ? 0.02 , Figure 1b . Expression of miR-885-5p and miR-331-3p was measured in nine neuroblastoma cell lines both MYCN-amplified and non-amplified using RT-qPCR and northern blotting Figure 1c . Expression of precursor and mature miR-885-5p was low in the cell lines and did not correlate with 3p25 status , whereas expression of precursor and mature miR-331-3p was higher and did not vary significantly Figure 1d Supplementary Figure S1b . Although miR-331-3p data did not indicate a clear role in neuroblastoma pathogenesis as a tumor suppressor , we further included miR-331-3p as a positive control to monitor the specificity of miR-885-5p-mediated effects . The lack of correlation between miR-885-5p expression and 3p25 status in the analyzed neuroblastoma cell lines suggests that other miR-885-5p-inactivating lesions exist in these cells . Our data support a tumor suppressive role of miR-885-5p at least in a subgroup of neuroblastomas with intact 3p25.3 . miR-885-5p inhibits neuroblastoma proliferation and survival . To analyze miR-885-5p function , we introduced miR-885-5p mimics into KELLY , IMR32 , SK-N-BE 2 c , SH-EP and HDN33 cell lines . SH-EP , KELLY and IMR32 cell lines have wild-type TP53 , while p53 in SK-N-BE 2 c is mutated in the DNA-binding domain and inactive as a transcription factor.13 Reported multinuclear cells with centrosome amplification14,15 and a heterozygous mutation leading to a codon 15 Ser to Cys exchange Supplementary Figure S2 indicate that the p53 pathway may not be intact in HDN33 cells . Cell proliferation was assessed using the Alamar Blue assay in cells transiently transfected with either the miR-885-5p or miR-331-3p mimics or a non-targeting control miRNA . Enforced miR-885-5p expression reduced proliferation of all cell lines , whereas miR-331-3p transfection only inhibited proliferation of HDN33 and SK-N-BE 2 c Figure 2a . SH-EP , KELLY , IMR32 and SK-N-BE 2 c cells were also less capable of anchorage-independent growth in soft agar after enforced miR-885-5p expression Figure 2b . Importantly , miR-885-5p introduction suppressed anchorage-independent growth more pronouncedly in cell lines with wild-type than mutant TP53 . Enforced miR-331-3p expression only reduced anchorage-independent growth of SK-N-BE 2 c cells . We tested whether proliferation inhibition by miR-885-5p was associated with senescence . Senescence-associated acidic b-galactosidase SA-b-Gal activity was detected in miR-885-5p-transfected , MYCN-non-amplified HDN33 and SH-EP cells Figure 2a , insert , but not in MYCN-amplified KELLY , IMR32 and SK-N-BE 2 c cells data not shown . Cell cycle profiles were analyzed after enforced miR-885-5p or miR-331-3p expression using flow cytometry FACS . Cell lines with wild-type TP53 accumulated in G1 G0 after miR-885-5p transfection Figure 2c , whereas enforced miR-885-5p expression in SK-N-BE 2 c and HDN33 resulted in accumulation in the S and G2 M phases , respectively . Enforced miR-331-3p expression produced no pronounced cell cycle changes 4±3 % in cells with wild-type TP53 , but resulted in G1 G0 and G2 M accumulation in HDN33 and SK-N-BE 2 c , respectively . We analyzed the sub-G1 fraction to ascertain whether cell cycle changes were accompanied by cell death . Enforced miR-885-5p expression slightly increased the sub-G1 fraction in SH-EP and IMR32 and moderately increased the sub-G1 fraction in SK-N-BE 2 c and HDN33 cells , whereas miR-331-3p transfection only in-creased the sub-G1 fraction in SK-N-BE 2 c cells Figure 2d . Enforced miR-885-5p expression increased the fraction of annexin V-positive cells in HDN33 and SK-N-BE 2 c cultures , but not TP53 wild-type cell lines Figure 2d , insert data not shown . Together , these data suggest that miR-885-5p-mediated inhibition of proliferation occurs pre-ferentially via G0 G1 arrest in TP53 wild-type neuroblastoma cells , and apoptotic cell death in neuroblastoma cells with disabled p53 pathways . miR-885-5p induces p53 and downregulates CDK2 and MCM5 . Protein levels of p53 and downstream targets were analyzed after enforced miR-885-5p expression to assess miR-885-5p influence on p53 regulation and function . The induction of p53 was marked in KELLY and IMR32 cells , moderate in SH-EP cells and also occurred in TP53 mutant , SK-N-BE 2 c cells Figure 3a . Enforced miR-885-5p expression elevated p21waf1 levels in KELLY , IMR32 and SH-EP cells , and PUMA in only IMR32 cells . Enforced miR-885-5p expression did not alter p53 and p21waf1 protein expression in HDN33 cells or p21waf1 and PUMA protein expression in TP53 mutant SK-N-BE 2 c cells , and miR-331-3p expression had no effect on p53 , p21waf1 and PUMA protein levels in any of the cell lines analyzed . Expression of miR-885-5p downregulated E2F1 in SH-EP , IMR32 , KELLY and HDN33 cells , but had no effect on MYCN and p27 protein levels Figure 3a , and data not shown . Caspase-3 activity was elevated in SK-N-BE 2 c and IMR32 after miR-885-5p introduction , although the increases were less than twofold Supplementary Figure S3 . Western blot analysis revealed reduction of procaspase-3 levels in all cell lines Figure 3a with no significant appearance of mature caspase-3 data not shown . Taken together , miR-885-5p expression induces p53 and p21waf1 in TP53 wild-type neuroblastoma cells , in line with the G0 G1 arrest observed after enforced expression . Querying the miRNA databases at http www.microrna . org16 and TargetScan17 http www.targetscan.org , and searching for candidate 30-untranslated regions UTRs using the miRanda algorithm18 in the UTResource 30-UTR database http www.ba.itb.cnr.it UTR retrieved STAT3 , CUL3 , CDK2 , MCM3 , MCM5 and CDK6 as candidate miR-885-5p targets , and p21waf1 and E2F1 as candidate miR-331-3p targets . Cleavage of STAT3 and MCM3 by apoptosis-executing proteases has been reported , and could have interfered with our expression analysis of these proteins.19,20 We examined candidate target protein expression after miR-885-5p and miR-331-3p transfection . CDK2 and MCM5 decreased after miR-885-5p transfection in all cell lines , supporting both as direct miR-885-5p targets Figure 3b . Enforced miR-331-3p expression reduced E2F1 levels in KELLY , IMR32 and SK-N-BE 2 c and reduced CDK2 expres-sion in IMR32 , although to a lesser extent than miR-885-5p . MCM3 cleavage was observed after miR-885-5p transfection of IMR32 and SK-N-BE 2 c cells , which prohibited estima-tion of direct miR-885-5p targeting of MCM3 . To test whether observed effects depended on the manner of miRNA overexpression , SH-EP and KELLY cell lines stably expres-sing either miR-885-5p or miR-331-3p were generated Supplementary Figure S1c . Phenotypes of miR-885-5p-SH-EP and miR-885-5p-KELLY lines were highly similar to transiently transfected SH-EP and KELLY cells . Most importantly , CDK2 and MCM5 were downregulated and p53 control control control control and p21waf1 were upregulated in miR-885-5p-SH-EP and miR-885-5p-KELLY cells , similarly to transiently transfected SH-EP and KELLY cells Supplementary Figure S4 . Accord-ingly , our data from in silico prediction and western blotting support that CDK2 and MCM5 are targeted by miR-885-5p . miR-885-5p directly targets the predicted binding sites in CDK2 and MCM5 30-UTRs . To test whether miR-885-5p binding sites in the CDK2 and MCM5 30-UTRs are directly regulated by miR-885-5p , we performed luciferase reporter assays . Relative firefly luciferase activities of reporter plasmids containing MCM5 or CDK2 30-UTR binding sites were inhibited by 20–40 % in miR-885-5p-SH-EP cells and pre-miR-885-5p-transfected SH-EP cells but not parental , vector-or miR-331-3p-SH-EP cells and control miRNA or miR-331-3p-transfected cells . Importantly , mutation of miR-885-5p binding sites in the CDK2 and MCM5 reporter constructs restored luciferase activity in miR-885-5p-SH-EP and premiR-885-5p-transfected cells Figure 4 . These data show that miR-885-5p directly targets predicted miR-885-5p binding sites in the CDK2 and MCM5 30-UTRs . CDK2 and MCM5 knockdown mimic miR-885-5p-induced phenotype . Previous studies have linked CDK2 and MCM5 with the p53 pathway . MCM5 was identified as a negative regulator of p53-induced growth arrest , 21 and CDK2 inhibition led to p53 accumulation in MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma cells.22 These suggest a link between phenotypic changes induced by miR-885-5p in neuro-blastoma cells and CDK2 and MCM5 suppression . To test this possibility , we introduced short interfering RNA siRNAs targeting CDK2 and or MCM5 into our neuro-blastoma cell line panel , and conducted phenotype analysis using the same panel of assays used to characterize the miR-885-5p-induced phenotype . CDK2 or MCM5 knockdown alone or in combination inhibited cell proliferation and anchorage-independent growth in all cell lines Figure 5a and b . Cell cycle analysis at 3 days after transfection of CDK2 or CDK2 MCM5 siRNAs revealed the accumulation of cells in G1 G0 phase in most cell lines Figure 5a . MCM5 knockdown produced an inconsistent cell cycle phenotype , with G1 G0 arrest in SH-EP and KELLY and G2 M arrest in the other cell lines . SK-N-BE 2 c cells are consistently accumulated in the G2 M phase after CDK2 and or MCM5 knockdown . The most SA -- Gal-positive cells were produced by combined CDK2 MCM5 knockdown in SH-EP and HDN33 cells Figure 5c , similar to miR-885-5p overexpression in these lines . CDK2 and or MCM5 knockdown in HDN33 increased the sub-G1 and annexin V-positive cell fractions Figure 5c , similar to miR-885-5p overexpression in these cells . CDK2 or MCM5 inhibition significantly increased apoptosis in SH-EP , KELLY , IMR32 and SK-N-BE 2 c cells . CDK2 knockdown upregulated p53 and p21waf1 in SH-EP , KELLY and IMR32 cells , and PUMA in IMR32 cells Figure 5d . CDK2 and or MCM5 knockdown in HDN33 cells did not affect p53 , p21waf1 or PUMA levels . Together , these data suggest that CDK2 and MCM5 inhibition is involved in miR-885-5p-mediated growth arrest and sene-scence in TP53 wild-type neuroblastoma cells . CDK2 and MCM5 inhibition can also has a role in miR-885-5p-triggered apoptosis and senescence in TP53 mutant HDN33 cells . Although both CDK2 and or MCM5 knockdown and miR-885-5p transfection in SK-N-BE 2 c upregulated p53 , they did not undergo apoptosis , suggesting that targets other than CDK2 and MCM5 modify the SK-N-BE 2 c response to miR-885-5p . miR-885-5p-induced growth arrest is p53 dependent in TP53 wild-type neuroblastoma . To determine whether miR-885-5p-induced growth arrest is indeed p53-dependent in TP53 wild-type neuroblastoma cells , we sequentially transfected TP53 wild-type SH-EP , KELLY and IMR32 cells with siRNA targeting p53 and miRNA mimics then assessed cell proliferation . Transfection of miRNA mimic into un-transfected or control siRNA-transfected cells induced the same phenotype . Expressing miR-885-5p failed to inhibit proliferation , anchorage-independent growth or induce G1 G0 arrest in p53 knockdown SH-EP , KELLY and IMR32 cells Figure 6a and b . Consistently , p21waf1and PUMA levels were unaffected by miR-885-5p expression after p53 knockdown in these cells Figure 6c . We thought to suppress endogenous miR-885-5p in neuroblastoma cells to further validate miR-885-p regulation of p53 , CDK2 and MCM5 . Only IMR32 and SK-N-BE 2 c cells expressed significant levels of miR-885-5p in RT-qPCR and northern blot analysis Figure 1d , Supplementary Figure S1 . No growth upregulation was observed upon antimiR-885-5p transfection in Alamar Blue assays data not shown . How-ever , antimiR-885-5p transfection of IMR32 and SK-N-BE 2 c cells produced a trend towards increased anchorage-independent growth . Importantly , antimir-885-5p transfection downregulated p53 , p21waf1 and PUMA in IMR32 cells , and p53 in SK-N-BE 2 c cells Figure 6d . MCM5 was mode-rately induced in SK-N-BE 2 c cells , and CDK2 was induced in SK-N-BE 2 c and IMR32 cells , after antimiR-885-5p transfection Figure 6d . Our data show that suppressing miR-885-5p affects p53 , p21waf1 , CDK2 and MCM5 protein levels , consistent with miRNA mimic transfection results , and strengthening the link between miR-885-5p and p53 miR-885-5p activates the p53 transcriptional program . In previous sections we provide evidence that miR-885-5p-mediated growth inhibition requires functional p53 in neuroblastoma cells . Gene expression profiles of neuro-blastoma cells with wild-type TP53 were generated using oligo microarrays at 3 days after miR-885-5p mimic transfection , and compared with cells transfected with control miRNA or miR-331-3p mimic to further characterize downstream effects of miR-885-5p expression . Genes with expression changes of at least twofold in both SH-EP and KELLY cell lines were considered to be regulated . There was little overlap between genes regulated in cells expressing either miR-885-5p or miR-331-3p 8 upregulated and 28 downregulated genes , Supplementary Tables S1 and S2 . Several p53 target genes IGFBP3 , ZMAT3 , TNFRSF10B , BTG3 , PPAP2B , PPM1D , RRM2B , PTPRE and DLC , were upregulated in miR-885-5p transfectants23 Table 1 . Only one p53 target , GDF15 , was upregulated in miR-331-3p transfectants . IGFBP3 and ZMAT3 were among the top-five blue 2 3 G1G0 genes upregulated in KELLY cells after miR-885-5p expression . These data implicate p53-directed trans-criptional changes downstream of miR-885-5p in neuro-blastoma cells . We used the expression profiles of miR-885-5p transfectants to assess expression of genes controlling p53 transcription either positively or negatively . Several genes E2F1 CDK2 actin known to positively regulate p53 , namely DYRK2 , HIPK2 and GAS1 , were upregulated after miR-885-5p expression . Enforced miR-331-3p expression altered expression of none of these , but did suppress the positive p53 regulator , PML Supplementary Table S2 . To validate that miR-885-5p-upregulated p53 target genes require functional p53 , we G0 G1 S miRNA miRNA miRNA miRNA miRNA miRNA miR-885-5p miR-331-3p miR-885-5p miR-331-3p miR-885-5p miR-331-3p miR-885-5p miR-331-3p miR-885-5p miR-331-3p miR-885-5p miR-331-3p M G2 control control control control control control miRNA miR-885-5p miR-331-3p control siRNA profiled KELLY cells with p53 knockdown expressing either miR-885-5p or miR-331-3p . Of the nine p53 target genes identified in the first profiling series Table 1 , seven validated miR-885-5p-induced genes IGFBP3 , BTG3 , ZMAT3 , PPAP2B , PPM1D , RRMB2 and PTPRE were not , or only nominally , induced after p53 knockdown Supplementary Table S3 , indicating that miR-885-5p induces these genes via increasing p53 transcriptional activity in these cells . We further tested whether genes downregulated after enforced miR-885-5p expression were enriched for potential miR-885-5p targets compared with upregulated genes , based on the in silico detection of at least one miR-885-5p potential binding site in the 30-UTR . We identified 74 downregulated genes 10.7 % compared with only 3 upregulated genes 0.9 % , Supplementary Table S1 . Downregulated genes identified as a miR-885-5p targets here included CDK2 Figure 3b Supplementary Figure S4 , caspase-3 CASP3 , -catenin CTNNB1 , citron rho-interacting kinase CIT , farnesyl transferase FNTA and microphthalmia-associated transcription factor MITF . Genes downregulated after miR-331-3p expression similarly included putative miR-331-3p targets harboring miR-331-3p binding sites 90 genes , 15.6 % , Supplementary Table S3 . These included PML , the serine threonine-protein kinase , PIM1 , neurobeachin NBEA , the nerve growth factor receptor , NGFR and ERBB2 , which was also recently reported to be a miR-331-3p target.24 A total of 19 8.2 % genes upregulated after miR-331-3p expres-sion also contain miR-331-3p target sites Supplementary Table S2 . This distribution of prospective target genes within genes regulated after miR-331-3p expression makes less sense than those regulated after miR-885-5p expression . Together with the lack of apparent phenotype in miR-331-3p-transfected neuroblastoma cells , these results support a less specific role for miR-331-3p in directing changes in the neuroblastoma cell phenotype . Our data indicate that miR-885-5p expression activates the p53 pathway in neuroblastoma cells , including p53 induction and p53 down-stream pathway activity , but that multiple pathways can be used by miR-885-5p during regulation of the neuroblastoma cell phenotype , especially in a TP53 mutant background . Table 1 miR-885-5p activates p53 transcriptional program P53 targets upregulated in miR-885-5p transfectants P53 targets upregulated in miR-331-3p transfectants GDF15 19p13.11 Growth differentiation factor 15 Discussion We provide evidence here that miR-885-5p is a candidate neuroblastoma tumor suppressor and involved in directing the neuroblastoma cell phenotype . Several commonly lost geno-mic regions have been characterized in neuroblastoma , without identification of the genes responsible for tumor suppression . Region 3p25.3 is deleted in B14 % of neuro-blastomas , and houses miR-885-5p . We show that miR-885-5p inhibits proliferation and survival , and positively regulates the p53 pathway . We present data for CDK2 and MCM5 being direct targets of miR-885-5p . Both miR-885-5p and miR-331-3p were initially chosen as candidate tumor suppressor miRNAs in neuroblastoma . Our findings show that miR-885-5p is downregulated in neuro-blastomas with heterozygous deletion of 3p25.3 , and that expression in neuroblastoma cell lines is low or absent independent of 3p loss . Expression of miR-331-3p correlates inversely with amplified MYCN in neuroblastomas , but no such trend was detected in cell lines . Experimentally enforced expression of miR-885-5p , not miR-331-3p , in neuroblastoma cell lines resulted in growth inhibition , senescence and apoptosis . Clearly , miR-885-5p fulfills the criteria of a tumor suppressor gene in the context of neuroblastoma . A master gene orchestrating cell cycle arrest , programmed cell death and senescence is TP53 . We provide evidence for p53 involvement in miR-885-5p-driven cell cycle arrest , senescence and apoptosis . Wild-type TP53 neuroblastoma cells displayed G1-arrest coupled with p53 and p21waf1 induction upon miR-885-5p introduction . Among six candi-dates , CDK2 and MCM5 met the miR-885-5p target criteria to create this phenotype 1 they were downregulated upon miR-885-5p introduction in all cell lines examined and 2 predicted miR-885-5p binding sites in their 30-UTRs reduced the expression of a reporter construct in the presence of miR-885-5p . CDK2 and MCM5 have been linked to negative regulation of p53 pathway activity.21,22 In this study , we report prominent phenotypic similarity between enforced miR-885-5p expres-sion and CDK2 MCM5 knockdown in TP53 wild-type neuroblastoma cells . Consistently , endogenous miR-885-5p knockdown elevated CDK2 and MCM5 levels and reduced p53 and its downstream targets . Additionally , p53 knockdown reverted changes in phenotype transcriptome and cellular proteins induced by miR-885-5p . Together , this indicates that CDK2 and MCM5 inhibition executes miR-885-5p-mediated growth inhibition in TP53 wild-type neuroblastoma cells at least in part via p53 induction . Importantly , miR-885-5p did not affect deregulated MYCN expression in MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma cells . Deregulated MYC proteins modulate p53 function by transcriptionally inhibiting p21waf1 , impairing G1 G0 arrest.25 Our data indicate that miR-885-5p restores p21waf1 function leading to G1 G0 arrest in TP53 wild-type neuroblastoma cells despite high MYCN levels . This miR-885-5p-mediated effect is mainly achieved through targeting CDK2 , because primarily CDK2 and not MCM5 knockdown exerts G1 G0 arrest and p21waf1 induction . It is curious that miR-885-5p also triggers apoptosis and senescence in neuroblastoma cells with mutant TP53 . Such cells can not engage p53 in response to CDK2 inhibition , which causes G0 G1-arrest failure in these cells . However , CDK2 may still function as a pro-survival signal in a TP53 mutant background , as demonstrated by CDK2 knockdown in HDN33 cells . Alternatively , MCM5 inhibition , may prevail in TP53-mutant cells , inducing a senescence-like process and G2 M phase arrest , as evidenced by MCM5 knockdown in HDN33 cells . Other miR-885-5p targets may also influence growth and survival in p53-mutant neuroblastoma . We propose a model for miR-885-5p function targeting CDK2 and MCM5 in neuroblastoma cells in Figure 7 . Our data provide indirect evidence for caspase-3 targeting by miR-885-5p . In neuroblastoma cells with elevated p53 protein levels , we detected only moderate upregulation of caspase-3 activity , reduction of procaspase-3 protein with no significant presence of its mature form and downregulation of CASP3 upon miR-885-5p introduction . The miRanda algorithm detected a miR-885-5p binding site in the CASP3 30-UTR . Intriguingly , caspase-3 can be involved in p21waf1 degradation.26 We propose that caspase-3 targeting may further determine the response of miR-885-5p-transfected cells , favoring p21waf1 accumulation Supplementary Figure S5 . Based on insights into miR-885-5p functions in neuroblas-toma cells , we can speculate that miR-885-5p may withdraw normal cells from cycling via p53 activation but maintain survival . In this context , it would be interesting to examine the role of miR-885-5p in developmental processes , such as neuronal maturation . We conclude that miR-885-5p engages p53-dependent and independent regulatory layers jointly to interfere with cell cycle progression and survival of neuro-blastoma cells . It negatively regulates CDK2 and MCM5 and activates the p53 pathway in TP53 wild-type neuroblastoma cells , and is able to trigger cell death and senescence in TP53-mutant neuroblastoma .

Another , less-well-studied , ER stress response is the ER overload response EOR , which signals via NF-kB.4,5 The degradation of aberrant ER proteins is mediated by a process termed ER-associated degradation ERAD .6 Activa-tion of the UPR induces a number of ERAD-related genes.7 ERAD involves export of the misfolded proteins via specific channels in the ER membrane and subsequent degradation by the cytosolar ubiquitin proteasome system UPS .6 The proteasome 20S catalytic core comprises three catalytically active beta b type subunits b1 , b2 and b5 , which convey peptidyl-glutamyl peptide-hydrolyzing-PGPH , trypsin-and chymotrypsin-like activity . The constitutive b subunits can be exchanged for the immuno subunits b1i , b2i and b5i under the influence of NF-kB signalling , for example during antigen presentation.8 The immunoproteasome displays slightly altered catalytic activity for example , it is capable of degrading tau faster and more efficiently in vitro.9 Changes in proteasome activity are reported for several neurodegen-erative disorders , including AD10,11 and Parkinson’s disease PD .12 Systemic administration of proteasome inhibitors in rats causes a PD-like phenotype , with a-synuclein and ubiquitin-positive inclusion bodies and neurodegeneration in the substantia nigra.12 This suggests that dysfunction of the UPS can lead to neurodegeneration . Interestingly , an increase in the immunoproteasome subunit b1i was observed in the AD brain , 13 a change in proteasome subunit composi-tion that is associated with increased chymotryptic activ-ity.14,13 This could be a response to the accumulation of substrates that require a different proteolytic specificity in order to be degraded . Another major degradational system reported to be activated by ER stress in vitro is autophagy.15–17 During autophagy , a double membrane is wrapped around an organelle or protein aggregate and this autophagosome subsequently fuses with a lysosome , forming an autophago-lysosome where degradation takes place . Mice deficient in autophagin atg 518 or atg719 accumulate ubiquitin-positive cytoplasmic aggregates and show neurodegeneration . Healthy neurons only rarely show autophagic structures , whereas many autophagic vacuoles can be observed in AD neuronal cell bodies and dystrophic neurites.20 A commonly observed lesion in the AD brain is granulovacuolar degenera-tion GVD , which is considered to be a disturbed autophagic process.21 It is typically seen in the cytoplasm of the pyramidal neurons of the cornu ammonis CA 1 and subiculum of the hippocampus , sites that also show extensive tau pathology.2 GVD consists of electron-dense granules surrounded by a clear vacuole that measure 2–4 mM in size . The presence of GVD in this region of the hippocampus correlates well with the diagnosis of AD . The UPR is activated as an early response in neurons in AD and may be a signal to enhance the degradational capacity of the affected neuron . Both the UPS and autophagy have a role in the degradation of aberrant proteins in neurodegenerative disorders and have been implicated in AD . UPR-positive neurons in the AD hippocampus are associated with early UPS pathology , in the form of ubiquitin-positive , p62-negative inclusion bodies , and show autophagic pathology in the form of GVD.2 Here we investigate the role of these two degradational systems during ER stress in vitro and in human AD brain material . All hypotheses tested in this study are visualized in Figure 8a . Results Immunoproteasome subunit expression is increased in the AD brain . Previously we reported that UPR activation is predominantly observed in AD hippocampus.3,2 Therefore , we evaluated expression of the immunoproteasome subunits b2i and b5i in this region of a cohort of AD and age-matched non-demented controls using immunohistochemistry . Both b2i and b5i expression is seen in AD and control hippocampus in neurons , glial cells and endothelial cells , based on morphological assessment Figures 1a–l . Increased b1i reactivity in these cell types in AD and aged hippocampus was previously described.13 Here we show a granular pattern of b2i reactivity in neurons , the intensity of which increases with Braak stages for neurofibrillary changes . No clear association is observed between b2i immunoreactivity in neurons and the local presence of Ab plaques and neurofibrillary changes data not shown . A moderate increase in b5i immunoreactivity in neurons is observed in high Braak stages . However , there is a remarkable increase in the number of glial cells that are immunoreactive for b5i in higher Braak stages . Double immunolabelling using b5i and a marker for astrocytes GFAP or microglia Iba1 shows that b5i is expressed in both astrocytes and microglia Figures 1m and n . Our data show that expression of the immunoproteasome subunits is increased in the AD hippocampus . ER stress effects on proteasome subunit expression . We next investigated whether UPR activation is responsible for the increased expression of the immunoproteasome in an in vitro model . Differentiated neuronal SK-N-SH cells were treated with increasing concentrations of tunicamycin Tm to chemically induce the UPR . No change in mRNA levels of the non-catalytic a subunits HC5 and C7 or the constitutive catalytic b subunits b1 , b2 and b5 is observed after induction of ER stress Figure 2a . Figure 2b shows that the UPR is active under these conditions , as mRNA levels of the UPR-responsive genes BiP and CHOP are increased 25.0-fold ±5.5 and 18.8-fold ±2.4 , respectively . ER stress increases expression of the immuno subunits b5i alternative transcript b5i-1 3.9-fold ±0.4 and b5i-2 4.1-fold ±0.7 and , to a lesser extent , b2i 2.0-fold ±0.3 . As a positive control for induction of the immuno b subunits , treatment with gIFN was used 5.9-fold ±0.6 , 132.0-fold ±22.5 and 576.8-fold ±81.3 for b2i , b5i-1 and b5i-2 , respectively . The UPR-responsive genes are not regulated by gIFN . The b1i subunit is increased by gIFN , but is below the detection limit under control or Tm conditions in our model and is therefore not included in Figure 2a . In accordance with our quantitative PCR qPCR data , gIFN results in increased protein levels of b2i and b5i B35-fold , but not of b2 . We find no regulation of the b2i , b5i and b2 proteins levels by Tm . The increase in BiP levels indicates that the UPR is active under these conditions3 Figure 2 . To exclude the effects of different kinetics , we extended the Tm treatment to 48 h , but this did not change the outcome not shown . Combined , we find moderate upregulation of the immunoproteasome subunits b2i and b5i at the mRNA level during ER stress , but this does not lead to a change at the protein level . ER stress does not affect b2i promoter activity . Most UPR-regulated genes contain ER stress-responsive elements ERSEs in their promoter . No ERSEs are found in the immuno b subunit proximal promoters , but all contain a consensus NF-kB site that is expected to be activated by the EOR if it is functional Figure 3a . To directly investigate the immunoproteasome b subunit promoter NF-kB responsiveness and the effect of ER stress on promoter activity , we cloned the promoter of b2i upstream of the luciferase gene . The b2i subunit is upregulated in AD post-mortem material Figure 1 , is upregulated by gIFN in our qPCR and western blot experiments Figure 2 and contains a consensus NF-kB-binding site Figure 3a . HEK293 cells were transfected with the b2i promoter-luciferase construct and treated with gIFN or Tm for 16 h . The BiP promoter-luciferase construct was used as a control for induction of the UPR.22 The activity of the b2i promoter is increased B2-fold by gIFN , but , as expected , there is no change in BiP promoter activity because it does not contain an NF-kB element Figure 3b . Abolishment of the b2i NF-kB-binding site by site-directed mutagenesis prevents gIFN-mediated regulation , demonstrating that the b2i promoter is responsive to NF-kB and that the NF-kB signalling route is functional in this model . In contrast , ER stress induced by Tm has no effect on b2i promoter activity , but does as expected increase BiP promoter activity Figure 3b . Although b5i promoter responsiveness was not directly investigated , our combined data indicate that expression of the immunoproteasome b subunits is not regulated by the UPR or EOR pathway of the ER stress response . ER stress has no effect on b5i subunit localization . Several studies indicate enrichment of the immunoproteasome at the ER membrane , 23,24 which may facilitate rapid degradation of proteins exported out of the ER by ERAD . Relocalization in response to a stimulus may therefore present another level of regulation . We investigated localization of the b5i subunit in differentiated SK-N-SH cells during ER stress . Because the great majority of b subunits is incorporated in proteasome complexes , this reflects subunits in actual proteasomes.25 Cells were double stained using antibodies directed against the b5i proteasome subunit and calnexin , an integral ER membrane protein Figure 4 . Reactivity to b5i and its colocalization with calnexin are increased by gIFN , indicating that the increased b5i protein localizes at least in part to the ER membrane . Treatment with Tm does not change the b5i intensity level , confirming our western blot data Figure 2c . In addition , the localization of b5i is not affected by activation of the UPR . Although increased immunoreactivity to b2i and b5i is observed in AD , our in vitro studies suggest that UPR activation is not responsible for this induction . ER stress does not increase proteasome activity . During ER stress , the demand for proteolytic activity is increased . We show that the proteasome b subunits are not subject to classical ER stress responsive regulation Figures 2 and 3 , nor is relocalization to the ER observed Figure 4 . However , this does not exclude regulation of the proteolytic activity of the proteasome . Using an unstable fluorescent substrate , a small decrease in proteasome activity was previously observed under conditions of ER stress.26 This reporter system has the disadvantage that it depends on factors besides proteasome activity e.g . transcription and translation . This method could yield inaccurate results , especially during ER stress , when translation in general is inhibited . To directly investigate the effect of ER stress on total proteasome activity , a fluorescent proteasome activity probe was used that covalently binds to the catalytic subunits of active proteasomes.27 Differentiated neuronal SK-N-SH cells were treated with Tm and subsequently incubated with the fluorescent reporter , and the fluorescent signal for the different subunits was visualized by SDS-PAGE and quantified Figures 5a and b . We find no detectable activity of the immunoproteasome . ER stress has little to no effect on proteasome activity in our cell model . A decrease in activity is observed at the highest concentration of Tm used however , this might have been caused by Tm-induced toxicity . LC3 levels are increased in pPERK-positive neurons in the AD brain . The levels of LC3 in AD hippocampus were evaluated using immunohistochemistry. LC3 reactivity is abundant in hippocampal neurons in AD Figure 7a and control subjects data not shown , whereas low intensity is observed in non-neuronal cells . The intensity of reactivity to LC3 is increased in AD in neurons showing GVD Figures 7b and c . The staining of LC3 is observed throughout the cell body , but appears to be more intense at the edges of the vacuoles , corroborating that GVD is related to autophagosomes . Occasionally , reactivity with the granular material inside the vacuole is observed . We have previously shown that UPR activation is associated with GVD in the AD hippocampus , 3,2 and therefore we used double immuno-histochemistry with the UPR marker phosphorylated PERK pPERK to investigate the connection between LC3 and UPR activation . LC3 intensity is increased in neurons displaying pPERK reactivity Figure 7d . These data show a clear correlation between UPR activation and the autophagy marker LC3 in human AD hippocampus . This corroborates our in vitro data demonstrating that the UPR preferentially activates the autophagy pathway and indicates that this response also occurs in vivo . LC3 processing is increased during ER stress . Our data show that the UPS is not upregulated by the UPR . Because during ER stress there is an increased presence of misfolded proteins , this may lead to accumulation and toxicity if they are not degraded . In contrast to the massive accumulation of polyubiquitinated proteins when using proteasome inhibition , different types of ER stress inducers Tm , thapsigargin Th and 2-deoxyglucose 2DG do not lead to accumulation in neuronal cells Figure 6a , upper panel . This may imply that the proteasome is redundant during ER stress , but it can not be excluded that basal proteasome activity is still sufficient to deal with the misfolded protein load during ER stress . In case of the latter , complete inhibition of proteasome activity should induce a massive UPR . We have previously demonstrated that proteasome inhibition does not induce a robust ER stress response , 28 suggesting that proteasomal activity is dispensable to resolve ER stress under conditions of UPR activation . ER stress was previously shown to be able to induce autophagy in vitro.29,15 To determine whether ER stress increases autophagy in our cell model , we measured LC3-II levels induced by various ER stressors Figure 6a , middle panel . The amount of LC3-II directly correlates with the amount of autophagosomes.30 Tm , Th and 2DG increase LC3-II levels and the LC3-II LC3-I ratio Figure 6b , indicating that autophagy becomes more active under conditions of ER stress . This suggests that autophagy is the preferred route for degradation of proteins during UPR activation . In this study , we investigated the effects of ER stress on the two major degradational systems in the cell the UPS and the autophagy pathway , and their relationship with AD Figure 8 . Increased expression of the immunoproteasome has been found in several neurodegenerative diseases13,31,32 see also Figure 1 . Increased expression of b2i and b5i was observed in affected brain areas of Huntington’s disease HD patients and a mouse model , 31 but could not be recapitulated in a HD cell model , 33 suggesting that a non-cell-autonomous mechanism is responsible for this induction . In analogy , we found that NF-kB is not activated by the EOR in neuronal cells . In the first report on the EOR , retention of a viral protein in the ER induced a robust NF-kB response in HEK293 cells.4 Another study indicated that chemical ER stress induction also elicits an NF-kB response.5 However , in our study we found no ER stress-mediated regulation of the NF-kB responsive subunits of the immunoproteasome in HEK293 or neuronal SK-N-SH cells . A small transcriptional response to ER stress was observed however , this was not sufficient to result in increased protein levels , indicating that the EOR is not effective in our models . We used the endogenous b2i promoter that contains a single NF-kB responsive element , whereas in the previous work a construct containing five NF-kB-binding sites was employed . A small induction of NF-kB may thus lead to increased activity of this reporter , whereas induction of the endogenous b2i promoter will have a higher threshold for transcriptional activation and is unlikely to reach the level required to yield changes at the protein level . In addition , the earlier studies did not investigate the endogenous proteins , as in our study , in which we found a transcriptional response not affecting the protein levels . Expression of the immunoproteasome in human brain increases with age.13 Inflammatory markers are increased in the elderly brain , providing support for an immune-mediated increase of the immunoproteasome.34 In the AD brain a myriad of immune responses can be observed associated with Ab deposits , including activation of complement , increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines e.g. , IL-1b , IL-6 and TNF-a , activated glia and increased NF-kB activation.35,36 Our data showed intense b2i immunoreactivity in AD pyramidal neurons , but less for b5i , whereas both subunits were expressed in glial cells . The b5i subunit is encoded within the major histocompatibility class II locus . This locus is transcriptionally less active in neurons , possibly explaining the low b5i expression levels . Although ER stress is not involved in increased expression of the immunoproteasome , this does not rule out a protective effect of the immunoproteasome when it is present . The immunoproteasome is capable of degrading tau more efficiently and with fewer intermediate fragments.9 Increased immunoproteasome levels may therefore attenuate tau aggregation . Although total proteasome content is unchanged , de-creased proteasome activity has been reported in AD.10,11 In contrast , a slight increase in activity was observed when proteasome complexes were purified.37 Aggregates like Ab can impair proteasome function in vitro38 and removal of these aggregates by proteasome purification might restore protea-some function . Using a direct assay to study proteasome activity , we demonstrated that UPR activation does not increase proteasome activity in our neuronal SK-N-SH cell model . A moderate decrease in proteasome activity , as measured by the accumulation of a fluorescently labelled UPS substrate , was previously described in MelJuso and Hela cell lines during chemically induced ER stress.26 As global translation is attenuated during ER stress , our activity probe assay gives a more direct and therefore more reliable result . We also observed a decrease in activity at higher ER stress levels . This may indicate that ER stress contributes to decreased proteasome activity in the AD brain . However , caution is warranted as under these conditions toxic side effects may obscure the data . Combined , our experiments showed that , in contrast to the increased expression of ERAD components , UPR activation does not enhance proteasomal capacity in vitro . However , ER stress conditions are characterized by the accumulation of proteins in the ER , which need to be degraded in order to ensure cell survival . The observation that ubiquitinated proteins do not accumulate during ER stress suggests that efficient degradation is taking place . We have previously shown that inhibition of the proteasome does not induce a robust ER stress response , as would be expected if the UPS has an essential role in degrading these proteins.28 This appears to contradict studies showing that proteasome inhibition induces cancer cell apoptosis via ER stress . Dividing cells are dependent on the proteasome for cell cycle progression , and possibly this makes them more susceptible to proteasome inhibition than post-mitotic neuronal cells . In agreement with other reports , 15,16 we found that ER stress increases the LC3-II LC3-I ratio , indicating that autophagy becomes more active . We demonstrated intense LC3 reactivity in pyramidal neurons in both AD and non-demented controls , indicating an important role for autophagy in neurons in the human brain . This is in line with observations showing that levels of LC3-I and LC3-II are high in the mouse brain compared with other tissues.39 Disruption of autophagy causes the accumulation of polyubiquitinated proteins in neurons in mouse brain.18,19 The finding that ubiquitin is involved not only in targeting substrates to the UPS but also in selective autophagy supports this hypothesis . High LC3 levels might be indicative of a highly active autophagy system and a priming of these cells to deal with misfolded proteins via autophagy . However , our antibody recognized both LC3-I and -II and thus did not give information about the autophagic state in brain . Alternatively , high LC3 levels might be indicative of a disturbed autophagic state , in which LC3 accumulates because it can not be degraded . In addition to morphological observations of disturbed auto-phagy in AD , 20 the levels of Beclin-1 are decreased in AD brain 40 therefore , different lines of evidence point to an impairment of autophagy in AD neurons . Strikingly , we found high LC3 levels in neurons that show disturbed autophagy , demonstrated by the presence of GVD , and had activated the UPR . Our data indicate a direct link between UPR activation , autophagy and the occurrence of autophagic If aberrant proteins accumulate to such extent that the UPR is induced , the ERAD process might be overwhelmed . In addition , higher amounts of misfolded proteins in the ER may more readily form aggregates , which can not be exported . Under these conditions , bulk degradation of parts of the ER may be a more favorable pathway to restore homeostasis . This hypothesis is supported by the fact that ER stress markers are observed in GVD in AD and that these neurons display high levels of the autophagy marker LC3 . It remains elusive whether autophagic pathology arises because the autophagy system becomes overwhelmed or whether , with age for example , the autophagic system becomes less efficient . Our data support a model in which the proteasome degrades misfolded proteins from the ER , but if this system is overloaded , autophagy is activated . This implies that autophagy is the major degradational pathway during activa-tion of the UPR in neuronal cells . Figure 8 shows a diagram of all hypotheses tested in this study and the final model . As the UPR is activated in neurons in which tau is not aggregated into tangles , this pathway may provide a target for early therapeutic intervention in AD .

ER stress could enhance proteolytic degradation by the proteasome by influencing the subunit composition via activation of the EOR . Alternatively , the UPR can be employed to enhance the expression levels of the constitutive subunits . In addition , regulation of the localization or activity of the proteasome may occur . In addition , the UPR may result in activation of autophagy . b Our data show that a disturbance of ER homeostasis resulting in activation of the UPR will activate the autophagy pathway . This can be due to a decreased capability to export misfolded proteins from the ER lumen under these conditions or may relate to the inability of the proteasome to degrade aggregated proteins . In AD neurons , decreased proteasomal degradation as well as a disruption in the autophagosomal lysosomal system may eventually lead to neurodegeneration 
21294818	Yayoi 1-1-1 , Bunkyo-ku , Tokyo 113-8657 , Japan Introduction Ommochrome pigments are widely distributed in animals Butenandt Schafer 1962 Linzen 1974 with colors ranging from yellow , red , purple and vio-let to black Linzen 1974 . Ommochromes are often found in pigment granules of specific cells in insects and confer enormous variations in body coloration and color patterns . In Drosophila melanogaster , two half-type ATP-binding cassette ABC transporters , White O’Hare et al. 1984 and Scarlet Tearle et al . 1989 , form a heterodimer to transport ommochrome precursors to pigment granules Sullivan et al. 1980 Ewart et al. 1994 Ewart Howells 1998 . Drosophila White protein also forms a heterodimer with another ABC transporter , Brown Dreesen et al. 1988 . The White ? Brown complex is responsible for the transport of another type of pigment , pteridines , e.g. , red-col-ored drosopterin Ewart Howells 1998 . Thus , the White protein can transport two structurally different pigments by forming a heterodimer with different partners White ? Scarlet for ommochrome precursors and White ? Brown for pteridine precursors Ewart Howells 1998 Mackenzie et al. 1999 . The Drosophila white gene is widely conserved in broad taxa of insects , and a defect in its orthologs causes a ‘white’ mutation in other insects . In the silk-worm , Bombyx mori , a classic model organism for genetics and physiology , ommochromes accumulate in the pigment granules of egg serosa and compound eyes , thereby causing dark brown and black coloration , respectively Tazima 1978 . It was recently shown that the white egg 3 w-3 chr10-19.6 mutation of Bombyx , having white eggs and eyes , is caused by a molecular defect in the Bombyx ortholog Bm-w-3 of Drosophila white Abraham et al. 2000 Quan et al. 2002a Komoto et al. 2009 . In addition to w-3 , two ‘white’ mutations , white egg 1 w-1 chr10-12.7 Quan et al. 2002b and white egg 2 w-2 chr10-16.1 Banno et al. 2005 , have also been identified in Bombyx . Previous studies have shown that the w-1 locus cor - responds to kynurenine 3-monooxygenase BmKMO Quan et al. 2002b , an ortholog of Drosophila cinnabar , which catalyzes the oxidation of kynurenine to 3-hy-droxykynurenine Tearle 1991 , a precursor of ommo-chrome pigments . However , the gene responsible for the w-2 locus has not yet been identified . The white egg and eye color of the w-2 mutant are similar to those of the w-3 mutant Tazima 1978 Banno et al. 2005 . However , a marked difference between the two mutants is that in w-3 mutants the larval epidermis becomes translucent Tamura Akai 1990 , i.e. , the ‘oily’ phenotype in Bombyx genetics , which does not occur in w-2 mutants Tazima 1978 Banno et al. 2005 . The larval exoskeleton of the normal silkworm is opaque white because of accumulation of urate gran-ules in the epidermal cells . It has been shown that w-3 larvae are unable to incorporate uric acid within the urate granules , resulting in translucent larval skin Tam-ura Akai 1990 . Thus , it has been speculated that the Bm-w-3 transporter protein is responsible for the uptake of two structurally different chemicals ommo-chrome precursors and uric acid Komoto et al. 2009 . As a means of unraveling the molecular basis for the transport of pigments and uric acid , we report here the identification and characterization of the gene responsible for the w-2 mutation . We performed positional cloning of the w-2 locus using the newly assembled genome sequence of Bombyx The Interna-tional Silkworm Genome Consortium 2008 and found that the w-2 locus corresponds to Bm-w-2 , an ortholog of the Drosophila scarlet . We examined the temporal and spatial expression patterns of Bm-w-2 and performed RNA interference RNAi experi-ments . Our results suggest that Bm-w-2 and Bm-w-3 form a heterodimer responsible for transporting ommochrome precursors . However , Bm-w-3 requires another unidentified half-type ABC transporter to form a functional transporter , which is responsible for transporting uric acid . This study emphasizes the functional conservation and diversification of half-type ABC transporters in insects , which may contrib-ute to their highly diverse color patterns . Results Phenotypes of w-2 mutant silkworms Ommochrome pigments accumulate in eggs and adult eyes of the wild-type wt silkworms and cause dark brown-colored eggs and black-colored eyes , respec-tively Tazima 1978 . In w-2 mutants , accumulation of ommochrome pigments is impaired and their eggs and eyes are white Fig. 1 Banno et al. 2005 . In another mutant allele of w-2 , red eyed w-2 w-2r , eggs are white but eyes are dark red Fig. 1 Banno et al. 2005 . Classical genetic studies have mapped the w-2 locus near the w-3 locus Fig. 2A , defects in which also cause a ‘white’ mutation . Previous studies showed that the w-3 locus corre - sponds to Bm-w-3 Abraham et al. 2000 Quan et al . 2002a Komoto et al. 2009 , a half-type ABC trans-porter that is an ortholog of Drosophila white . It has been speculated that Bm-w-3 transporters are involved in the transport of ommochrome precursors and uric acid Komoto et al. 2009 . In contrast , little is known about the w-2 locus . The fact that the w-2 phenotype is similar to that observed in the w-3 strains with respect to egg and eye color but lacks an oily skin character Abraham et al. 2000 suggests that w-2 plays an essential role in ommochrome pigmenta-tion but is not involved in the formation of urate granules . To gain additional insight into the function of the w-2 locus , we performed positional cloning using the newly assembled whole genome data of Bombyx . Positional cloning of w-2 To perform positional cloning of the w-2 locus , we obtained 359 eggs 143 white and 216 pigmented from a male-informative single-pair backcross BC1 between a w-2 ? w-2 female and an F1 male +w-2 ? +w-2 female · w-2 ? w-2 male Fig. S1A in Supporting Information . Single nucleotide polymorphism SNP markers that showed polymorphism between the par-ents were generated at each position on chromosome 10 Fig. S1B , C in Supporting Information and used for genetic linkage analysis . We were able to narrow the responsible region within 215 kb on a scaffold GA002923 , BGIBMGA002924 and BGIBMG - w-2 e15 w-2r e16 10 days AEL and adult eyes of wt C108T , w-2 e06 and egg serosa cells and adult eyes of w-2 mutants , thereby caus - R12 09L-R11 09R-R19 - 1 1 925 Bm_scaf30 chromosome 10 Fig. 2B , C . Within this region , four genes , BGIBMGA002922 , BGIBM - A002925 , were predicted by Gene model program Fig. 2C The International Silkworm Genome Consortium 2008 . We performed homology search and found that BGIBMGA002922 corresponded to Bm-w-3 Abraham et al. 2000 Komoto et al . 2009 , a Bombyx ortholog of Drosophila white , and BGIBMGA002925 did not show homology to any known genes . BGIBMGA002924 showed high homology with Drosophila Scarlet protein and had an ABC transporter motif . Subsequent 5¢-and 3¢-rapid amplification of cDNA ends RACE experiments showed that BGIBMGA002923 and BGIBMG-A002924 composed a single transcript encoding an ABC transporter Fig. 2C . Thus , we designated this novel transporter gene as Bm-w-2 and subjected it to further analysis . Structure of Bm-w-2 We determined the genome structure and the full-length cDNA sequence of Bm-w-2 in the wt strain p50T Fig. 3A , B . Bm-w-2 consisted of 14 exons , with the start codon in the first exon and the stop codon in the last exon . BGIBMGA002923 and BGIBMGA002924 corresponded to exons 2 , 3 and 5– 12 of Bm-w-2 , respectively Fig. 2C . Bm-w-2 had an open reading frame ORF of 2010 bp , which encoded a protein of 670 amino acids . The protein showed 51 % and 42 % identities in amino acids to Drosophila Scarlet and White , respectively , and 40 % amino acid identity and 53.5 % nucleotide identity to Bm-w-3 . Bm-w-2 protein had a typical domain struc-ture of the ABC transporter superfamily an ATP-binding domain at the N-terminal half and a trans-membrane domain at the C-terminal half Higgins 1992 Schneider Hunke 1998 Fig. 3B . To determine whether molecular defects were pres-ent in Bm-w-2 from w-2 mutants , we next determined the full-length cDNA sequences of Bm-w-2 genes from w-2 and w-2r strains by RACE experiments . As shown in Fig. 3C , D , we found mutations in both mutant w-2 alleles . In w-2 strains e06 and e15 , we found a 7-bp insertion within the Walker A motif , which caused a premature stop codon at position nt 649 Fig. 3C . As this mutation resulted in a severe truncation of the pre-dicted protein , w-2 appeared to be a null allele . In the w-2r strain e16 , we found a 6-bp deletion in Bm-w-2 Fig. 3D . Although the deletion in the w-2r allele was in-frame , the affected residues were located on the highly conserved H-loop ? switch motif Schneider Hunke 1998 , suggesting that the function of the pro - TGCTACT tein was severely impaired . Taken together , these results strongly indicate that Bm-w-2 is responsible for the w-2 locus . We performed phylogenetic analyses of insect White , Scarlet and Brown ABC transporters with their clo-sely related proteins Fig. 4A . To collect the sequences we performed a homology search using the genome databases of six insect species with fully sequenced genomes D. melanogaster , Anopheles gam-biae , B. mori , Tribolium castaneum , Apis mellifera and Pediculus humanus . The phylogenetic tree showed clear separations between White , Scarlet and Brown subfamilies . Although an ortholog of Drosophila scarlet was not identified in the Bombyx genome in previous studies Abraham et al. 2000 Komoto et al. 2009 , our results clearly showed that Bm-w-2 belonged to the scarlet subfamily . White and Scarlet proteins were found in all insects investigated , but Brown proteins A were not found in the genomes of B. mori , T. castaneum Because white and scarlet genes were juxtaposed in a head-to-tail orientation in the Bombyx genome , we investigated whether this gene arrangement was also conserved in other species . As illustrated in Fig. 4B , a tandem arrangement of white and scarlet genes was observed in B. mori , T. castaneum and A. mellifera , whereas they were located on different loci in D. mel - anogaster , A. gambiae and P. humanus . The evolution - ary conservation of the tandem arrangement of white and scarlet suggests that these two genes were derived from a tandem duplication of an ABC transporter . White and scarlet are separated in dipterans and P. humanus . This appears to be a result of a chromo-somal rearrangement in each lineage . Expression profiles of Bm-w-2 during embryonic development Hibernating silkworm eggs accumulate dark brown ommochrome pigments in a single-layer membrane of the serosa Tazima 1978 Fig. 5A . To examine the temporal expression profile of the Bm-w-2 gene during progression of the pigmentation of egg serosa , which normally becomes evident by 36 h and is com-plete by 96 h after egg laying AEL Fig. 5A , we performed RNA blot experiments using total RNA extracted from eggs of wt strains . As shown in A B C D GFPi Fig. 5B , we detected a transcript of 2.7 kb in the eggs . This signal was not observed until 12 h AEL , but sharply increased at 24 h AEL . The signal was dramatically reduced at 36 h AEL and became barely detectable after 48 h AEL . Similarly , we observed the expression of Bm-w-3 mRNA observed after 24 h which became undetectable by 60 h AEL . In addi-tion , their expression patterns were confirmed by semi-quantitative RT-PCR Fig. 5C . This rapid rise and fall in Bm-w-2 and Bm-w-3 mRNA expression appeared to coincide with the onset of accumulation of ommochrome pigments in the serosa Fig. 5A , but not with the progression of pigmentation . One explanation for this is that the uptake of ommo-chrome precursors into serosa cells predominantly occurs during 24–36 h AEL and then the incorpo-rated precursors are gradually converted to ommo-chrome pigments i.e. , ommatins and ommins , leading to the progression of pigmentation . Alterna-tively , their proteins may be stable and can continue to function when the synthesis of nascent protein is at a low level . In any case , our results suggest that the concerted expression of Bm-w-2 and Bm-w-3 may be crucial for the transport of ommochrome precursors in egg serosa cells . Furthermore , they imply that this may be a prerequisite for initiation of the formation of ommochrome granules in the serosa . To provide direct evidence that Bm-w-2 is responsi-ble for w-2 , we next performed RNAi experiments . We injected dsRNA into wt strain pnd+ eggs at 7–8 h AEL . As shown in Fig. 5D , eggs injected with Bm-w-2 dsRNA did not become dark brown and remained white in contrast to eggs injected with GFP dsRNA . To confirm the phenotype induced by RNAi is because of specific knockdown of Bm-w-2 , we analyzed the expression levels of Bm-w-2 and Bm-w-3 in the dsRNA-injected eggs using quantitative RT-PCR qRT-PCR Fig. 5E . At 24 h AEL , the expression level of Bm-w-2 in the eggs injected with Bm-w-2 dsRNA was decreased to approximately 14 % of that injected with GFP dsRNA . However , expression level of Bm-w-3 was not affected by the injection of Bm-w-2 or GFP dsRNA . These results clearly show that Bm-w-2 is responsible for w-2 and is essential for the forma-tion of ommochrome granules in the serosa cells . Spatial expression pattern of Bm-w-2 in the fifth instar larval stage Next , using semi-quantitative RT-PCR , we investi-gated the spatial expression patterns of Bm-w-2 in 16 tissues of wt day 3–5th instar larvae and compared RP GS a G B RH CTS E V SM GS G SF GGM B F T O A P G H GM T E p i cycles Bm-w-2 38 Bm-w-3 38 them with those of Bm-w-3 and BmKMO genes Fig. 6 . We observed the expression of Bm-w-2 in several tissues , including brain , gonads and gut cells with the highest expression in Malpighian tubules . Interestingly , expression of Bm-w-3 and BmKMO was also highest in Malpighian tubules . These results sug-gest that Malpighian tubules may play a major role in the biosynthesis of ommochrome precursors . One remarkable difference between the expression profiles of Bm-w-2 and Bm-w-3 was that Bm-w-2 was not expressed in the epidermis , where urate granules accumulate and confer the opaque appearance of larval skin . The absence of Bm-w-2 expression in lar-val epidermis suggests that Bm-w-2 is not involved in the transport of uric acid there . As noted earlier , in support of this , larval skin remains normal in the null mutants of w-2 Tazima 1978 Banno et al. 2005 Fig. 7 and Table 1 . In this paper , we have identified and characterized the gene responsible for the w-2 mutation . The pres-ent study has four important implications . First , we showed that White and Scarlet ABC transporters Serosa adult eye Larval epidermis Table 1 Summary of white egg mutants of silkworm precursors , and their specificity is determined by partner proteins Scarlet or Brown Ewart Howells 1998 Mackenzie et al. 1999 . Similarly , Bm-w-3 appears to have two substrates , ommochrome precur-sors and uric acid Abraham et al. 2000 Quan et al. 2002a Komoto et al. 2009 . Our results suggest that Bm-w-3 acts as a heterodimer with Bm-w-2 for the transport of ommochrome precursors , whereas Bm-w-3 requires another unidentified partner for the transport of uric acid , as the larval skin remains nor-mal in w-2 mutants Tazima 1978 Banno et al. 2005 Fig. 7 and Bm-w-2 is not expressed in the epidermis Fig. 6 . We first speculated that the product of the brown ortholog of Bombyx formed a heterodimer with Bm-w-3 to transport uric acid . However , we were unable to find a brown ortholog in the Bombyx gen-ome . Similarly , brown orthologs were not identified in the genomes of T. castaneum and P. humanus Fig. 4B , showing less conservation of the brown sub-family in insects . The loss of brown orthologs in these insects appears to be associated with the lack of pteri-dine pigments in their eggs or eyes , as it has been suggested that pteridines do not contribute to the egg and eye colors in Bombyx Tazima 1978 and are not contained in the eyes of Tribolium Lorenzen et al. 2002 . In contrast , ommochrome pigments have been found in all insects tested to date . This may explain why white and scarlet subfamilies appear to be more highly conserved in insects Fig. 4 . It was suggested that Drosophila White protein and its partners play roles other than pigmentation , such as the removal of potentially harmful free tryp-tophan in the hemolymph Linzen 1974 , formation of fluorescent granules in Malpighian tubules Yagi Ogawa 1996 and neurobiological functions e.g. , histamine uptake in epithelial glia cells Borycz et al. 2008 . Therefore , the expression of Bm-w-2 and Bm-w-3 in various tissues such as Malpighian tubules , brain , gut cells and gonads Fig. 6 may reflect such diverse functions of White and its part-ners in Bombyx physiology . It is also noteworthy that extensive gene duplication of white orthologs seems to have occurred in Daphnia , as eight copies of white genes were identified in its genome Sturm et al. 2009 . Taken together , the present results fur-ther imply that ABC transporters may be greatly diversified in terms of gene repertoires , gene regula-tion and substrate specificity , depending on insect color patterns and physiology . We anticipate that our work will encourage additional studies on other loci that are associated with the coloration of the egg serosa and eyes of silkworms Banno et al . 2005 and consequently pave the way for a greater understanding of ABC transporters , which play vari-ous important roles in animals Dassa Bouige 2001 Dean et al. 2001 . Recent advances in genetic engineering of silk-worm have greatly increased the economical impor-tance of this insect Tamura et al. 2000 Tomita et al. 2003 . We believe that the Bm-w-2 gene will be a useful marker for transgenesis , as this gene has several advantages over conventional fluorescent Horn et al. 2000 and other phenotypic markers that have been proposed for silkworms Quan et al. 2002a , b . i Fluorescent microscopes can be omitted , ii trans-genic individuals can be screened at the embryonic stage , iii egg colors are not affected by maternal inheritance , iv lethality or sterility is not observed in null w-2 mutants , and v Bm-w-2 can be used as a dominant selectable marker in combination with RNAi . We are currently developing a novel transfor-mation marker using Bm-w-2 . Experimental procedures Silkworms were reared on an artificial diet or mulberry leaves at 25–27 ? C under standard conditions . The wild-type wt silkworm strains p50T and C108T are maintained in the Uni-versity of Tokyo e06 w-2 ? w-2 , e15 w-2 ? w-2 , e16 w-2r ? w-2r and t90 w-3ol ? w-3ol were obtained from the Kyushu University pnd+ +w-2 ? +w-2 is maintained in the Transgenic Silkworm Research Center of the National Institute of Agro-biological Sciences NIAS and C108 and Katsu-H w-2 ? w-2 were obtained from the Genebank of the NIAS , Japan . Positional cloning of w-2 For recombination mapping , we obtained 359 eggs 143 white and 216 pigmented from a male-informative single-pair BC1 between a Katsu-H female · an F1 male C108 female · Ka-tsu-H male . Genomic DNA of each BC1 individual was iso-lated from whole body of neonate larva using DNAzol solution Invitrogen . SNP markers on chromosome 10 were constructed and used for the genetic analysis as described pre-viously Ito et al. 2008 . The primers for the SNP markers used in the linkage analysis are listed in Table S1 in Support-ing Information . Total RNA was collected from the Malpighian tubules of fifth instar day 3 larvae of strains p50T , e06 , e15 and e16 and was used for 5¢-and 3¢-RACE experiments with a GeneRacer Kit Invitrogen . PCR was performed following the manufac-turer’s protocol using PCR primers listed in Table S2 in Sup-porting Information . The PCR products were subcloned and sequenced as previously described Daimon et al. 2003 . RT-PCR and RNA blot analysis Total RNA was isolated from eggs and tissues of fifth instar day 3 larvae of the p50T strain and reverse-transcribed as pre-viously described Daimon et al. 2003 . Hydrochloric acid treatment of eggs was carried out at 20 h AEL . Semi-quantita-tive RT-PCR analysis was performed as previously described Daimon et al. 2010 using the primers listed in Table S2 in Supporting Information . PCR conditions were as follows 30– 40 cycles of 94 ? C for 30 s , 54 ? C for 30 s and 72 ? C for 1.5 min . The identity of each RT-PCR product was con-firmed by DNA sequencing . RNA blot analysis was performed as previously described Daimon et al. 2008 . Briefly , total RNA from eggs was extracted using TRIzol reagent Invitro-gen . One microgram of RNA was loaded and hybridized with specific probes . RNA probes for Bm-w-2 and Bm-w-3 were synthesized by in vitro transcription using the DIG RNA labeling kit Roche . The DNA probe for ribosomal protein 49 rp49 was prepared by PCR using the DIG PCR probe syn-thesis kit Roche . Primers used for probe synthesis are listed in Table S2 in Supporting Information . RNAi experiments The template for the synthesis of dsRNA corresponding to Bm-w-2 1055–1488 nt or EGFP was amplified by PCR using gene-specific primers containing T7 polymerase sites see Table S1 in Supporting Information . The resulting PCR products were purified and used as templates to generate dsRNAs using the MEGAscript RNAi Kit Ambion accord-ing to the manufacturer’s instructions . After synthesis , the products were analyzed by gel electrophoresis and the con-centrations of dsRNAs were measured spectrophotometrically A260 . The dsRNA solutions were diluted to 10 nM in RNase-free water and 2–3 nL was injected into embryos of the pnd+ strain at the preblastoderm stage as described previ-ously Quan et al. 2002a . Injected embryos were incubated at 25 ? C in a moist Petri dish . To perform qRT-PCR analy-sis , total RNA from a single egg injected with dsRNA was extracted at 24 h AEL using Isogen Nippon Gene and used as a template for the synthesis of cDNA with RevertraAce reverse transcriptase Toyobo . The expression level of Bm-w-2 mRNA and Bm-w-3 mRNA was quantified using a Light-Cycler 1.5 Roche . To ensure homogeneity of the amplified PCR product , melting curve analysis was performed on all reactions . The Bombyx rp49 gene was used to normalize tran-script levels . Primers used for quantitative PCR are listed in Table S1 in Supporting Information . Quantitative PCR was preformed in duplicate . Statistical test was performed using Student’s t-test n 4 . A P-value of 0.05 was considered significant . Acknowledgements We thank T. Kiuchi for sharing the silkworm samples , T. Aigaki and T. Ide for providing Drosophila stocks , M.

Introduction In research on lifespan and aging , a suitable biophysical model that can be used to analyze biodemographic data survival or mortality curves quantitatively is essential to connect a macroscopic relationship e.g . fluctuation with a biological mechanism e.g . gene expression at a molecular level . Recently , we proposed a fluctuation theory as a diffusion model to quantitatively analyze the survival curves and the rates of mortality , and we experimentally examined the validity of the lifespan equation using the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans Shoyama et al. , 2007 Suda et al. , 2009 . There is strong evidence that stochastic as well as genetic factors are significant in C. elegans aging Herndon et al. , 2002 . Thus , to examine the molecular mechanism behind aging and lifespan , our biophysical model is expected to serve as an effective analytical tool that can extract information on a regulatory system from survival or mortality curves . C. elegans is a small poikilothermic worm with a simple structure no heart , no blood vessels , no lungs , and no liver . In addition , no cancer has been found in this animal . The number of diseases that the worm experiences , therefore , is considerably smaller than that in humans . C. elegans is frequently used as an ultimate model animal in age-related research in which death occurs naturally under identically controlled circumstances without predators . Thus , using this model animal was essential to demonstrate our theory . However , Wu et al. 2006 and Suda et al. 2009 reported heterogeneity in survival or mortality through genetic penetrance even in an isogenic C. elegans cohort , which seems to provide nearly ideal experimental conditions . Without a suitable model , it would be very difficult to analyze biodemographic data from animals more complex than C. elegans , such as flies or mice , and extract biological meaning . Thus , in this sense , C. elegans remains crucial to our study . Furthermore , to test the validity of the lifespan equation , lifespan assays are conducted by varying the time intervals of the observations . Therefore , as one of our objectives , we use the lifespan equation to determine whether a reduction in the time intervals causes the experimental rates of mortality of the egl-1 mutant gradually to approach the force of mortality theoretically predicted from the fitting equation of the survival curve . The metabolic rate and lifespan of poikilotherms depend signifi-cantly upon the environmental temperature Loeb and Northrop , 1917 Clarke and Maynard Smith , 1961 Liu and Walford , 1972 Klass , 1977 McArthur and Sohal , 1982 Gillooly et al. , 2001 . Another of our objectives is to clarify the influence of genetic as well as environ-mental factors on aging and lifespan using a wild type and several age-related mutants in C. elegans . The main pathway of C. elegans aging is the insulin IGF-1 signaling pathway . Thus , daf-16 mutants that inactivate this signaling pathway were used . We also used a null mutant of the C. elegans AMP-activated kinase ? 2 catalytic subunit AAK-2 , an energy sensor that functions as a measure of energy levels in the AMP ATP ratio Apfeld et al. , 2004 . aak-2 has also been shown to adjust the slow release of energy Narbonne and Roy , 2009 . We conducted a further test of the fluctuation theory by measuring the temperature dependence of lifespan and energy metabolism on the basis of the rate theory of chemical reaction . The data obtained were analyzed from the viewpoint of the biochemical reaction and bioenergetics . As a starting hypothesis , we postulated that the rate of the biochemical reaction would have a Boltzmann s factor that included the activation energy . Metabolic energy or respiratory activity can be easily estimated by indirectly measuring the rate of oxygen consumption . We developed an optical instrument to conveniently measure the respiratory rate of C. elegans Suda et al. , 2005 . The respiratory activity of C. elegans exponentially declined with age after matura-tion Shoyama et al. , 2007 , 2009 . From the profile of respiratory rate as a function of age , we precisely isolated the physiological decline rate , ? , corresponding to the rate of aging . The exponential decline of respiration with aging means that the number and or activity of mitochondria will decrease exponentially Short et al. , 2005 . The value of ? may be determined by the imbalance between the damage and repair of respiratory enzymes in mitochondria . Reactive oxygen species ROS Harman , 1956 and or mitochondrial DNA mutations Short et al. , 2005 Hiona and Leeuwenburgh , 2008 Augustin and Partridge , 2009 Bratic et al. , 2010 are probably one of the main causes of this damage . The origin of ? may be found in the rate of a chemical reaction . This viewpoint assumes that the respiratory enzymes may be randomly damaged after maturation , similar to the radioactive decay of an unstable atomic nucleus , which seems to be phenomenologically compatible with the mitochondrial vicious cycle theory of aging Hiona and Leeuwenburgh , 2008 . The respiratory activity of worms has a finite value in advanced age , and the maximum and mean lifespans strongly correlate with the reciprocal of the aging rate . This result suggests that lifespan may be controlled through ? . Thus , we previously proposed the rate theory of chemical reaction to explain quantitatively the two findings cited above . From this rate theory , we conclude that the aging rate ? appears to be the sum of the damaged and repaired rate constants . On the other hand , the finite value of respiratory rates at older ages may be proportional to the repaired rate and the reciprocal of the sum of both rate constants . These previous results are demonstrated in further detail by estimation of the activation energy . 2 . Materials and methods 2.1 . C. elegans strains used , maintenance , and culture conditions Strains were maintained and manipulated under standard conditions Brenner , 1974 . In the present work , we used the following four strains Bristol N2 wild type , CF1038 [ daf-16 mu86 I ] , MT1082 [ egl-1 n487 V ] , and RB754 [ aak-2 ok524 X ] . Fertilized eggs were prepared using alkaline hypochlorite to bleach egg-laying adult worms Sulston and Hodgkin , 1988 . Synchronized worms were grown on nematode growth medium NGM plates 90 mm ? seeded withthe E.coli OP50 strain asa worm food source . For measurements of the respiratory activity and lifespan assay , worms were continuously cultured at 10 , 16 , 20 , and 25 °C after being hatched at 20 °C . During egg-laying , parental hermaphrodite worms were transferred to new plates every day when the temperature was 25 °C , this was done to prevent contamination of progeny until progeny production ceased , while , in cases of lower temperature , this was done every several days according to the worms growth rate to minimize mechanical damage to them . 2.2 . Lifespan assay and the count of progeny per worm The lifespan assay was conducted in the following way . For each lifespan assay , 100–120 worms were usually used in 10 plates 10–12 worms per plate of 35 mm ? . The worms were observed and counted daily to determine whether they were dead or alive . They were prodded gently with the tip of a platinum thin wire . Worms that did not respond were considered to be dead and were removed from the plates . Worms which suffered abnormal death i.e. , those which did not die of natural causes by old age due to internal hatching of progeny inside the hermaphrodite , desiccation due to climbing up the plate wall , protrusion of the gonads through the vulva , accidental killing by the experimenter , or loss were excluded from the initially set sample number in the lifespan analysis , unless otherwise indicated . The age denotes the time after hatching 0 time of hatching . For all lifespan experiments , assays were repeated at least three times . The entire survival curve of egl-1 mutants at 25 °C indicates a two-step-like shape , as reported in a previous work Suda et al. , 2009 . Indeed , we observed that about 90 % of the population quickly died due to internal hatching of larvae or disease from day 3 to day 6 . The remainder died gradually of natural causes after day 6 . For convenience , in this study , we analyzed the biodemographic data of only the population that died from disease . We conducted the lifespan assay by changing the observed time intervals 6 h , 12 h , and 24 h . In addition , daily progeny production by individual hermaphro-dites using 10 worms was determined by counting offspring when the progeny passed through several larval stages or reached young adulthood , and assays were independently repeated twice . Self-fertility was calculated only for those individuals that died of natural causes . The statistical analyses and the illustration of figures were conducted using a KaleidaGraph version 3.6 , Hulinks software . 2.3 . Measurements of oxygen consumption rates by an optical apparatus The oxygen consumption rates of C. elegans were measured using 10 or 20 worms in a single trial and combining an optical oxygen sensor FOXY-2000 , Ocean Optics , Inc. , USA and a sample chamber with a volume of 3.14 ? l . The apparatus for measuring the oxygen concentra-tion and its specifications has been described in detail by Suda et al. 2005 . Before the measurement , using a thin platinum wire , worms were usually transferred from a cultured plate into the sample chamber . They were immersed in a liquid medium of 0.7 ? l with the same composition as that of NGM , except for agar , including heat-killed bacteria ? 3 ? 108 cells ml . The dead bacteria were prepared by sterilizing the bacterial suspension in a micro-tube with heating N95 °C for 5 min . Each measurement was carried out within 40 min at room temperature 22±1 °C . The precise control of room temperature was indispensable to this study because the metabolism of C. elegans strongly depends on the ambient temperature . In addition , before transference into the chamber , the bacteria attached to the bodies of the worms were carefully removed as they crawled on the NGM agar plate in the absence of a bacterial lawn . 2.4 . Analytical models 2.4.1 . Definitions of the mortality rate and the force of mortality The fraction survival to age x is given by lx 100 % Nx N0 , where N0 and Nx are the initially set population of animals and the number of animals alive at age x , respectively . As a practical matter in the analysis of C. elegans data on aging only , note that N0 means the finally scored number that subtracts the number of abnormal deaths from the initially set population . The age-specific mortality rate qx at age x x–x+ ? x is generally defined by Since observations were conducted daily in the present measure-ments , ? x 1 , except for the egl-1 mutant . Thus , our experimental mortality rate , qx , may be given as follows qx lx ? lx lx + 1 qx is a discrete quantity , whereas the force of mortality , ? x , is generally defined as a continuous quantity as follows 1 dNx 1 dlx lx ? lx d ? x ? ? lim + ? x ? loglx ? 3 ? Nx dx lx dx ? x ? 0 ? xlx dx In this paper , the mathematical symbol ‘log’ is defined as the natural logarithm . Thus , the force of mortality implies the limit of the mortality rate , i.e. , ? x ? 0 , as well as N0 ? 1 . 2.4.2 . A summary of the fluctuation theory We derived the lifespan equation from the biological background based on the diffusion differential equation as described in a previous paper Shoyama et al. , 2007 . First , as the simplest case in which individuals are genetically and environmentally homogeneous and compose a cohort , we derived the following solution lx where z 4Dt0 . D and t0 represent the fluctuation constant and the onset of demographic aging , respectively . Here , animals cultured under identically controlled circumstances , including temperature , nutrients , and lack of predators , were assumed to die of a single natural cause . As a biological meaning of z , we have reported that the inverse of z is proportional to the exponential decline in the rate of respiration , ? 1 z ? ? 2 Shoyama et al. , 2007 . Substituting Eq. 4 for Eq. 3 , the force of mortality is expressed approximately as ? x ? 2 x ? t0 z2 at x ? t0 and ? x 0 at xbt0 . B of Mortality Force 0.1 D From the lifespan equation , Eq. 4 , introducing the cut-off of l % c* N0 , the mean lifespan , ? xd ? , and the maximum lifespan , ? , are givenas follows h xdi ? For the case of n causes of death , the extended version of Eq. 4 is given as follows lx ? li ? x ? p ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? where li x l0i x , t0i + l0i ? l0i x , t0i e ? x ? t0i 2 z2 , i zi 4Dit0i , l0i at xbt0i l0i ? x t0i ? , and ? l0i 100 . The mean lifespan 0 at x ? t0i i including multi-components may be written as h xdi ? t0i + zi ? 7 ? 100 2 i Substituting Eq. 6 for Eq. 3 , the force of mortality can be expressed as ? x ? t0i ? li ? x ? ? x 2 ? ? at x ? t0i and ? xi 0 at xbt0i ? 8 ? zi2 lx i daf-16 aak-2 2.4.3 . The rate theory of chemical reaction for the two findings of respiratory activity In previous studies Shoyama et al. , 2007 , 2009 , using almost all lifespan-related mutants , we found that the respiratory activity per worm , VO2 • , after maturation was expressed by VO2 • ? + ? exp ? ? ? x ? and ? ? 0 , where ? and ? represent the constants , ? , the rate of aging , and x , the age after hatching x 0 . To interpret these findings using a conceivable model , we first postulated that respiratory enzymes in mitochondria were spontaneously destroyed with the forward rate constant , kd , as the following first-order reaction . kd N ? D Here , kr , N , and D represent the reverse rate constant and the native and damaged states , respectively . The reverse reaction points to a process of repair or maintenance . According to the simplified self-decay model , the first-order ordinary differential equation for N is expressed as dN dt ? kdN+krD , which may be solved as N ? ? + ? ? exp ? ? ? t , where N+D Ni and Ni is the initial value . The concrete expressions of ? ? , ? ? , and ? ? are given by ? ? kr Ni ? ? ? ? Ni ? kr Ni ? ? and ? ? ? kd + kr ? respectively In a previous interpretation of our experimental data , we assumed that N corresponded to the respiratory activity of each worm . 2.4.4 . The activation energy and its estimation Inthisstudy , wepostulatethattherateofthebiochemicalreactionhas aBoltzmann sfactor , exp ? Ea RT , inwhichEa representsthefreeenergy of activation or , simply , the activation energy the so-called energy barrier , R is the gas constant , and T is the environmental or body temperature given as the absolute temperature in Kelvin Eisenberg and Crothers , 1979 Berg et al. , 2007 . According to the scaling biology Gillooly et al. , 2001 , the lifespan is expected to be in inverse proportion to a rate constant of the rate-limiting chemical reaction in metabolism . In figures , the mean and maximum lifespans versus 1 RT are plotted as a semi-logarithm , where a measure of RT the so-called thermal energy is very useful to directly evaluate the activation energy , which is mathematically expressed by log ? lifespan ? In other words , the slope of a fitting line by exponential regression analysis represents the activation energy . In this way , we can easily estimate the activation energy from the semi-logarithmic plot . Table 1 Statistical and analytical values determined in Fig. 2 .

The fluctuation theory is further supported by biodemographic data of the egl-1 mutant To enhance the reliability of the fluctuation theory , we employ the egl-1 mutant and directly check how the rates of mortality are influenced by the observed time interval , ? x . In a previous work Sudaet al. , 2009 , we reported thatabout 90 % of thepopulation quickly died at 25 °C due to internal hatching of larvae or disease from day 3 to day 6 and the remainder gradually died of natural causes after day 6 . In thepresentwork , we analyzeonly thepopulation that died from disease as biodemographic data for the sake of convenience . In the case of ? x 1.0 day , the mortality rates , qx , reach a complete plateau at advanced ages , as shown in Fig. 1B . Here , we first fit the raw survival data Fig. 1A using the lifespan equation , Eq. 4 . We then calculate the predicted mortality , q ? , x from our model by substituting the equation of survival with parameters determined in the previous step for Eq. 2 . The q ? x values are in quite good agreement with the experimental qx values , as seen in Fig. 1B . On the other hand , ? x is not at all coincident with qx or q ? . x However , as the time interval ? x in Eq. 1 decreases from 1.0 to 0.25 day , qx or q ? x gradually approaches ? x , and both match up approximately at ? x 0.25 . Here , our result suggests that we should not fit the mortality rate directlyusingamodelequationgivenfortheforceofmortality.Ifwe fitted the mortality rates in Fig. 1B–D directly using a model equation for the force of mortality , we would obtain inaccurate results . In other words , only if the rates of mortality could be approximately regarded as continuity could the force of mortality fit them directly . In particular , the case of a small number of animals , including long-lived animals , in an experimental condition should be noted because an increase in discreteness occurs . Previously , Suda et al. 2009 showed a typical example in which the rates of mortality do not always fit the force of mortality because of the issues of qx-discreteness and ? x-continuity . Their proposal , which indicates the proper procedure for the analysis of biodemographic data with regard to the rates of mortality , is summarized as follows . First , a survivalcurveshouldbe fittedwithasuitablemodelequation , e.g. , Eq . 4 , as described in Section 2.4.2 . Subsequently , the mortality rate , q ? , x as well as the force of mortality , ? x , should be calculated on the basis of the definition equation , Eq. 2 , by substituting the fitting parameters obtained from the previous step for the formulated survival equation . However , even if ? x were analyzed according to the above procedure , if continuity were not held , a large deviation between qx or q ? and ? x would x be generated . We want to emphasize here that ? x is a predicted value at the limit of ? t ? 0 and or N0 ? ? . In addition , even if there is a large deviation between qx or q ? x and ? x , it is not a logical error . 7 aak-2 daf-16 N2 daf-16 aak-2 N2 A 0.395 20 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 N2 Table 2 Numerical values of the activation energy Ea kJ mol estimated in Fig. 3 .

Temperature dependence of lifespan for N2 , daf-16 , and aak-2 mutants and estimation of the effective activation energy for lifespan Here , we investigate a significant influence on lifespan that occurs by changing the environmental temperature , and we examine the validity of both the rate theory of chemical reaction for aging and the lifespan equation for biodemographic data . In Fig. 2 , the survival curves of worms cultured continuously at various temperatures 10 , 16 , 20 , and 25 °C are plotted for N2 , aak-2 , and daf-16 mutants . It was not convenient to use temperatures lower than 10 °C and greater than 28 °C because of abnormal growth . In this study , we want to characterize the wild type therefore , long-lived mutants and temperature-sensitive mutants were not used . The original survival curves can sometimes be separated into two components after analysis with the extended lifespan equation , Eq. 6 . The addition of more components does not result in a better fit . The non-linear least-squares fitting method is used to fit the lifespan equation statistically to the experimental values . Unlike the case of the egl-1 mutant , however , in these strains , the reason for the two phases is unclear it is probably a case of hidden heterogeneity . Statistical values determined from these data are summarized in Table 1 . Our result is almost compatible with that of Klass 1977 , who first reported the temperature dependence of lifespan and fertiliza-tion in the wild type . The mean and maximum lifespans may be analytically expressed by the combination of two parameters t0 and z , as predicted by Eq. 5 in our diffusion model . All living things , to maintain their vitality and smoothly perform movements at comparatively low temperatures , are generally composed of countless biochemical reactions , each of which is catalyzedatasignificantrate byanenzyme.Thus , wemaybeable to find a crucial clue to a molecular mechanism of lifespan in terms of biochemical reactions and bioenergetics . The lifespan is expected to be in inverse proportion to a rate constant of the rate-limiting chemical reaction in metabolism . If so , both t0 and z are expected to simultaneously yield the same relationship . Indeed , here , we examine whether or not these relationships are realized .

Fig. 3A and B shows the semi-logarithmic plots of the mean and maximum lifespans versus 1 RT , respectively . As expressed by Eq. 10 , a slope of a fitting line by exponential regression analysis represents the activation energy . As a result , Ea kJ mol values of N2 , aak-2 , and daf-16 for the mean lifespan are 50.7 , 36.6 , and 54.1 , respectively . Likewise , Ea kJ mol values for the maximum lifespan are 40.4 , 35.1 , and 50.7 , respectively . The energy barriers of N2 and daf-16 are almost the same , while that of aak-2 is smaller than that of N2 . These estimated values are summarized in Table 2 . When we evaluate the Ea of N2 on the basis of the findings by Klass 1977 , the Ea values for the mean and maximum lifespans in N2 from 10 to 25.5 °C are calculated to be 60.4 and 59.1 kJ mol , respectively . Klass s values are larger than our experimental values , which may be due to a slight difference in the mutual experimental conditions , such as the quantity of food . Now , we show the semi-logarithmic plots of t0 and z versus 1 RT in Fig. 3C . As a result , the Ea kJ mol values of t0 for N2 , aak-2 , and daf-16 were 63.1 , 40.1 , and 68.9 , respectively , while those of z were 38.3 , 22.7 , and 45.9 for N2 , aak-2 , and daf-16 , respectively . Here , it is noteworthy that t0 and z in the case of two components were approximately calculated according to Eq. 7 as the average of t01 and t02 and the sum of z1 and z2 , respectively . As expected , the Ea of t0 is close to that of the mean lifespan , while the Ea of z is not equal to that of the mean lifespan but , rather , is close to the Ea of the maximum lifespan . Details of the effective roles of t0 and z in the mean and maximum lifespans are discussed below . 3.3 . Temperature dependence of respiratory activity and effective activation energy for aging The oxygen consumption rates per worm , VO2 • ? pl min worm ? , for the wild type were measured for worms cultured at different temperatures and plotted as a function of age , as shown in Fig. 4A to D. The respiratory rates per worm with age were analyzed using a single exponential relation as defined in Section 2.4.3 . As worms gradually grew to young adulthood , the respiratory activity gradually increased . After maturation , a sudden reduction was observed for all cases . This behavior roughly synchronized with the peak of egg laying . To provide this information at a glance , a fertility curve is merged on each respiratory datum in Fig. 4A to D. Taking this point into account , we carefully analyzed the raw experimental data to fit the exponential function . The numerical values analyzed in Fig. 4A to D are summarized in Table 4 . In addition , two rate constants , kd and kr , solved by using the statistically determined values of ? and ? and Eq. 9 , where the peak value of VO2 • serves as Ni in Eq. 9 , are shown in this table . As seen in Table 4 , as the temperature of the culture decreases , the destroyed rate constant , kd , gradually decreases . Furthermore , kd is approximatelytwotoseventimeslargerthantherepairedrateconstant , kr , as expected . The higher the temperature of the culture , the larger the ? value . As previously reported Shoyama et al. , 2007 , ? is proportional to the reciprocal of z . In addition , z is proportional to the inverse of the Boltzmann s factor as demonstrated above . Therefore , we ask here whether ? is proportional to exp ? Ea RT . This prediction is also supported by the relationship of ? kd +kr and the implication of the Boltzmann s factor in kd and kr . In Fig. 4E , the logarithm of ? is plotted as a function of 1 RT . The correlation between experimental data and a predicted straight line is very high the correlation coefficient r 0.9921 . Thus , this result suggests that ? includes the temperature dependence as the Boltzmann s factor . Consequently , the activation energy in ? is estimated to be 48.1 kJ mol . This value is close to that of z 38.3 kJ mol . The result is consistent with our previous result in which ? was proportional to the reciprocal of z .

The biological role of the effective activation energy for lifespan and aging Any organism has many enzymes that smoothly initiate countless biochemical reactions to maintain the organism s life . The biochemical reaction is quite compatible with the Arrhenius equation or the Eyring s theory of absolute reaction rates Glasstone et al. , 1941 Eisenberg and Crothers , 1979 Hänggi et al. , 1990 . As is well known from scaling biology Brown and West , 2000 , the metabolic rate , lifespan , and many other physiological properties of various species follow a power law of body mass . The metabolic rate and or lifespan is influenced by the temperature as well as the body mass Gillooly et al. , 2001 Kolokotrones et al. , 2010 . For unicells , plants , multicellular invertebrates , fish , amphibians , rep-tiles , birds , and mammals , Gillooly et al. 2001 first estimated 39.5 to 71.3 kJ mol as the effective activation energy representing the energetics of rate-limiting reactions in metabolism . They pointed out that these values were close to the free-energy change of ATP . On the other hand , Kolokotrones et al. 2010 determined a value of 91.5 kJ mol in mammals using an improved analytical method . They also pointed out that this value was less than the free-energy change of the full hydrolysis of ATP to AMP under standard cellular conditions ? 109 kJ mol Alberts et al. , 2002 . The effective activation energy in relation to aging and lifespan may represent rate-limiting processing in maintenance and repair such as protein synthesis , chaperone activity , or proteosomal activity . However , here , we postulate a central rate-limiting step in energy production or consumption as one possibility , first discussed by Gillooly et al. , which is why we measured the metabolic energy correlated with the lifespan . Viewing our results from their perspective , we note that the Ea values in the lifespan of wild type and daf-16 mutants are approximately equal to the magnitude of the free-energy change of ATP to ADP , denoted by the symbol ? GATP–ADP , ? 46.0 to ? 54.3 kJ mol ? 11 to ? 13 kcal mol Alberts et al. , 2002 , where one J is equivalent to 0.239 cal . On the other hand , the Ea in aak-2 mutants is less than the magnitude of ? GATP–ADP . However , it is noteworthy that the rate of a reaction depends on the free energy of activation or the activation energy , which is largely unrelated tothe free-energy changeof the reaction , usually denotedbythesymbol ? G , as highlighted by Berg et al. 2007 . In other words , the activation energycorrespondstothestandardfree-energychange Glasstoneetal. , 1941 Eisenberg and Crothers , 1979 but not to the free-energy change of the reaction . This point is essential for the identification of the biological meanings . Generally , the standard free-energy change at pH 7 is denoted by the symbol ? G0 ? . According to a data handbook of biochemical and molecular biology Fasman , 1976 , the ? G0 ? of Mg-ATP2 ? to Mg-ADP is ? 24.0 kJ mol , that of ADP3 ? to AMP2 ? is ? 36.3 kJ mol , and that of ATP4 ? to ADP3 ? is ? 35.4 kJ mol . Therefore , taking the above estimation from the data provided by Klass into consideration , our results suggest that the Ea of the mean and maximum lifespans and the t0 for the wild type and the daf-16 mutants may mean the ? G0 ? of Mg-ATP2 ? to AMP , ? 60.3 kJ mol , while those for aak-2 mutants probably correspond to the ? G0 ? of ADP3 ? to AMP2 ? , ? 36.3 kJ mol , because of the high AMP ATP ratio that occurs with aging Apfeld et al. , 2004 , which suggests different mechanisms between genotypes . For the sake of caution , the ? G0 ? of Mg-ATP2 ? to Mg-ADP given in a popular textbook is referred to as ? 30.5 kJ mol ? 7.3 kcal mol Alberts et al. , 2002 Berg et al. , 2007 . Thus , the ? G0 ? of Mg-ATP2 ? to AMP2 ? may be ? 66.8 kJ mol rather than ? 60.3 kJ mol . On the other hand , the Ea of z for the wild type and the daf-16 mutants probably is the ? G0 ? of ADP3 ? to AMP2 ? , while that for aak-2 mutants seems to be the ? G0 ? of Mg-ATP2 ? to Mg-ADP . Consequently , taking into account that the Ea of z is smaller than that of t0 , the biological meaning of t0 and z in our equation appears to reflect a role of the duration of development , growth , and aging . In short , t0 seems to be closely related to development and or growth , while z may be related to aging . This result suggests that the activation energy may switch from the Ea of t0 to the Ea of z with aging . Finally , we refer to an example of the activation energy in other species . In the fruit fly Drosophila , the total duration of life including larvae , pupae , and imago was measured in detail as a function of temperature Loeb and Northrop , 1917 . When we calculate the effective activation energy , Ea , using the numerical values provided in the study by Loeb and Northrop , we obtain 82.0 kJ mol . This value is much larger than the Ea of C .elegans and the standard free-energy change of Mg-ATP2 ? to AMP2 ? . Regrettably , since the data regarding temperature dependence using lifespan-related mutants are not yet available for the fly , we can not investigate the biological meaning of the energy activation any further . This problem remains to be solved in the future . 4 . Conclusion In summary , first , as the time interval of observation was reduced , mortality rates gradually approached the force of mortality expected from the fitting equation of the survival curve calculated by the lifespan equation . Thus , the fluctuation theory can be strongly supported by the biodemographic data of elg-1 mutants . Second , aging and lifespan were investigated in terms of biochemistry and bioenergetics . The effective activation energy or energy barrier for lifespan may be closely related to the standard free-energy change of ATP or ADP for a wild type and some lifespan-related mutants , as inferred after an analysis of thetemperature dependence of survival data using the lifespan equation . The effective activation energy crossing the barrier between life and death was estimated on the basis of the rate theory of Eyring , also called the energy barrierofthetransitionfromlifetodeath.Third , themeanandmaximum lifespans can be well expressed by the combination of the two parameters t0 and z included in our diffusion model . We also assigned a role of the two parameters for aging and lifespan by comparing the activation energy included in their parameters with the standard free-energy change of ATP or ADP . This result suggests that t0 , defined as the onset of demographic aging , maybe closely related to development and or growth , whereas z appears to be related to aging . Finally , the impossibility of predicting lifespan chance for an individual originates inthestochasticbehaviorinthediffusionprocessbetweenlifeanddeath , which implies that aging is the process of individuation .

21392185	Introduction Calcineurin B homologous protein 2 CHP2 , also known as hepatocellular carcinoma antigen 520 HCA520 , belongs to the super family of N-myristo-lated , EF-hand Ca2+-binding protein CHPs Pang et al. 2001 Wang et al. 2002 . Three isoforms of CHPs have been identified to date . CHP1 also called P22 is expressed ubiquitously in virtually all tissues CHP 3 also called tescalcin is expressed only in a few normal tissues Zaun et al. 2008 . Unlike CHP1 and 3 , the expression of CHP2 is restricted to cancer Pang et al. 2002 and the small intestine Inoue et al. 2003 . Of the three isoforms , CHP1 has been charac-terized in the most detail . CHP1 has been reported Communicated by Hiroshi Hamada *Correspondence pang @ ihcams.ac.cn   These two authors contributed equally to this paper . mutagenesis NHE1 mutants , I534K , I534D and I537K show the importance of hydrophobic interac-tions between CHP2 and NHE1 for the activity of NHE1 and plasma location of CHP2 Ammar et al. 2006 . However , little attention has been devoted to identify the key amino acids or motifs of CHP2 determining its affinity for interaction with NHE1 , especially the two canonical EF 3 4 Ca2+-binding motifs . Moreover , intracellular Ca2+ flux plays a cru-cial role in the proliferation and differentiation of cells Crabtree Olson 2002 . As for CHP1 , tightly bound Ca2+ ions are important structural elements in the ‘pHi sensor’ of NHE1 Pang et al. 2004 . Several other groups report the interactions between CHPs and NHE1 , but there is still little information avail-able about the role that Ca2+ plays in the interaction of NHE1 with CHP2 . In contrast , putative nuclear export sequence NES was also found in CHP2 . NES is a short sequence that has been identified as a motif required for the active nuclear export of proteins Sorokin et al. 2007 . Inoue et al. 2003 suggested for the first time that the fluorescence signal of CHP2-GFP in the nucleus was stronger than that of CHP1-GFP Inoue et al. 2003 . But the function of CHP2 located in the nucleus is still obscure . Recently , a few reports have shown that over-expression of CHP2 accelerates proliferation , growth , invasion and metastasis in ovarian cancer Jin et al. 2007 and human embryonic kidney cell line 293 HEK293 Li et al. 2008 . These important roles of CHP2 prompted us to study its functional mecha-nisms with NHE1 , NES and Ca2+ ions in trans - formed cells . We discovered that the binding of Ca2+ ions to EF-hand 3 4 motifs determined the plasma membrane location of CHP2 via forming a Ca2+ ? CHP2 ? NHE1 complex . More interestingly , we found that accumulation of CHP2 in the nucleus could enhance the proliferation and oncogenic poten-tial of tumor cells . Besides given a profound interpre-tation of CHP2 located on plasma membrane in a Ca2+-dependent manner to adjust NHE1 activity , our results have shown that the regulation of subcellular location mediated by NES affects the function of CHP2 in cancer proliferation . Characterization of Ca2+-binding motifs in CHP2 Human CHP2 protein has a primary sequence highly homologous to that of CHP1 61 % identity . CHP2 contains four EF-hand Ca2+-binding motifs , of which two ancestral sites might not bind Ca2+ because of the substitution of critical acidic residues . The canoni-cal EF-hand consists of 29 consecutive residues with two flanking helices and a 12-residue loop Fig. 1 . The chelating loop residues in positions 1 +x , 3 +y , 5 +z , 7 y , 9 x and 12 z ligate Ca2+ through seven oxygen atoms arranged three dimen-sionally on the axes of a pentagonal bipyramid . The z position , providing the only side-chain oxygen atoms , is crucial for Ca2+ binding Yap et al. 1999 . 45Ca2+ binding to EF-hand motifs of CHP2 was ana-lyzed using recombinant CHP2 and CHP2 ? NHE1 aa 515–545 complex . We introduced mutations into EF1 , EF2 , EF3 and EF4 in which acidic residues aspartic acid or glutamic acid at the z position were replaced by alanine Fig. 2A . We co-expressed the wild-type or mutant CHP2s together with the juxtamembrane region of NHE1 aa 515–545 in Esc-herichia coli . On 12 % SDS–PAGE , EF3m and EF4m proteins were found to migrate more slowly than the wild-type , EF1m or EF2m proteins Fig. 2B , sug-gesting that a mutation-induced conformational change , which occurs in these mutant proteins , had impaired Ca2+ binding . We measured 45Ca2+ binding to various CHP2 mutant proteins by a membrane filtration procedure . We found that 45Ca2+ bound to the purified CHP2 proteins with an apparent Kd of 88 nM . When CHP2 formed a complex with the NHE1 fragment , the binding affinity for 45Ca2+ increased markedly 42-fold , Fig. 3A . Mutation of either of Ca2+-binding motifs EF3 or EF4 , but not EF1 and 2 , resulted in loss of approximately one half of 45Ca2+ bound to the complex Fig. 3B . However , 45Ca2+ binding was completely blocked when the experiment was carried out using EF3 ? 4m proteins two sites were simulta-neously mutated even with the NHE1 fragment Fig. 3B . Together , these results indicate that CHP2 binds two Ca2+ ions , one at EF3 and the other at EF4 . To determine how complex formation increases the Ca2+-binding affinity , we measured 45Ca2+ release from CHP2 proteins by rapid filtration . As shown in Fig. 4A , most of the 45Ca2+ bound to CHP2 without the NHE1 fragment was released rapidly t1 3 s . ? 2 In contrast , 45Ca2+ release from CHP2 ? NHE1 aa 515–545 complex t1 8 s was much slower . A ? 2 slow release of 45Ca2+ also occurred in two mutant CHP2 proteins , EF3m and EF4m , complexed with the NHE1 fragment Fig. 3B , suggesting that Ca2+ binds tightly to each EF-hand and each of the Ca2+-binding EF-hand has a similar Ca2+-binding property as that of CHP1 Fig. 4B . As CHP2 is an EF-hand Ca2+-binding protein via motifs 3 4 , we examined the Ca2+-dependent func-tion of CHP2 due to these two motifs . CHP2-EF3m and EF4m proteins were found to migrate more slowly than the wild-type , EF1m or EF2m proteins on SDS–PAGE Fig. 2B , lower panel . Disparity of electrophoretic velocity of CHP2 proteins suggested that Ca2+ is indispensable to maintain the natural conformation of CHP2 . When Ca2+ is reduced by 10 mM ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid EDTA , CHP2 did not co-immunoprecipitate with NHE1 Fig. 5A , B . Consistently , this study shows that Ca2+ is an important factor for regional distribution of CHP2 , as weaker green fluorescent protein GFP fluorescence was observed on the plasma membrane in CHP2-EF3m ? 4m-GFP cells than that of wild-type CHP2-GFP controls Fig. 5C . The binding of Ca2+ ions to EF-hand 3 4 determines CHP2 to locate onto the cell plasma membrane via affecting CHP2 ? NHE1 complex formation . We tried to explore putative signaling sequences in CHP2 that might control its intracellular distribution . We found a NES-like motif residues 137–148 in the carboxyl-terminal region of the protein . The NES element of CHP2 is similar to typical NES sequence , which consists of leucine and other hydro-phobic residues isoleucine , valine , phenylalanine and methionine , with characteristic spacing as CHP1 reported previously Fig. 1 . This putative NES motif of tissue-specific isoform CHP2 is conserved Inoue et al. 2003 , so we suggest that the putative NES sequence of CHP2 is of functional significance . To determine whether the putative carboxyl-ter-minal NES was relevant to the nuclear export of CHP2 , we examined the localization of CHP2-GFP with point mutants of NES in HeLa cells . For the determination of the functional effect of NES on sub-cellular location of CHP2 , wild-type CHP2-GFP fusion protein and CHP2-GFP fusion protein deriva-tives with substitutions in NES sequence L137A ? L140A ? L142A ? V144A ? V146A ? V148A were constructed . Then , the stable transfectants with these protein derivatives were selected . These mutant proteins were shown to have the expected molecular size as that calculated for the wild-type CHP2 by SDS–PAGE and immunoblotting data not shown . Wild-type CHP2-GFP was predominantly located in the cyto-plasm of HeLa cells , whereas CHP2-GFP fusion pro-tein derivatives with substitutions in NES sequence CHP2-NESm-GFP were found in the nucleus Fig. 6 . This analysis clearly shows that NES func-tions as a signal for the export of CHP2 from the nucleus and has sufficient activity for the proper nuclear export of CHP2 . Nuclear accumulation of CHP2 accelerates cell proliferation in vitro Previous studies have documented increased expression of CHP2 in a variety of tumor tissues Jin et al. 2007 Li et al. 2008 . To investigate the potential involve-ment of NES in tumor cells , we compared the in vitro growth characteristics of three cell lines by means of 3-4 , 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl -2 , 5-diphenyltetrazoli-um bromide MTT and colony-formation assays . Sta-ble transfectants of GFP-tagged CHP2 fusion proteins with NES mutation were obtained for the proliferation observation of HeLa cells in the subsequent studies . Figure 7 showed that transfectants of CHP2 with NES mutant CHP2-NESm had an enhanced potential of proliferation , of which the CHP2-NESm protein was accumulated in nucleus . In colony-forming assay , CHP2-NESm cells formed not only more colonies Fig. 7A , B but also larger colonies than CHP2 and control cells Fig. 7A , C . In MTT assays , at each time point examined over the course , the stable transfectant of CHP2-NESm constantly produced more cells than the stable transfectants of CHP2 and normal HeLa cells Fig. 7D . As further evidence , enhanced cell prolife-ration was also observed in transiently transfected MCF 7 breast cancer cell line , Michigan Cancer Foundation-7 and MDA-MB-231 M.D. Anderson -Metastatic Breast cell line-231 cells in bulk cultures data was not shown . These data suggested that tumor cells bearing CHP2-NESm had greater growth poten-tial than either wild type or control . Accumulation of CHP2 in nucleus promotes the oncogenic potential of HeLa cells in vivo We next examined whether accumulation of CHP2 in nucleus altered the tumorigenic capacity of HeLa cells in vivo . When cells were inoculated subcutane-ously , tumors formed in the CHP2-NESm group were consistently larger in size than those in the CHP2 control group Fig. 8A . At the end , the total mass of the tumors harvested from the CHP2-NESm group was nearly threefold more than that of the CHP2 group P 0.01 Fig. 8B . Furthermore , the CHP2-NESm transfectants appeared to be more aggressive , invading into many abdominal organs , such as spleen , liver and kidney than HeLa cells with CHP2 data was not shown . Collectively , our pres-ent findings strongly suggest that the accumulation of CHP2 in nucleus significantly increases the tumori-genic capacity of HeLa cells . Discussion Subcellular distribution is an important characteristic of a protein because location is intimately related to its function . Current work shows that subcellular localiza-tion of CHP2 is regulated by the following factors i Ca2+ ions binding to EF-hand 3 4 motifs of CHP2 determine its location onto cell plasma membrane via complex formation between CHP2 and NHE1 ii experiments of point mutations in NES signal impli-cate that NES signal controls distribution of CHP2 in or out of the nucleus . Ca2+ determines the location of CHP2 onto cell plasma membrane to adjust pHi via complex formation of CHP2 ? NHE1 , whereas NES signal regulates CHP2 into nucleus to enhance cell proliferation , but how the two pathways are regulated still needs to be further studied . Our previous study has shown that CHP2 could regulate pHi of cells . Here , we focus on how CHP2 localizes on the mem-brane to interact with NHE1 and how NES inactiva-tion regulates CHP2 into nucleus and then enhances the cell proliferation . CHP is an EF-hand Ca2+-binding protein Ca2+ is crucial for its activity . Here , we first examined the role of EF-hand Ca2+-binding motifs in CHP2 . Our results indicated that a Ca2+ ion bound to each of EF3 and EF4 in CHP2 with an overall apparent Kd of 88 nM . This Ca2+-binding affinity was close to that of another family member , CHP1 apparent Kd 90 nM . CHP2 potentially has four Ca2+-binding motifs the two ancestral sites EF1 and EF2 do not bind Ca2+ as CHP1 . The Ca2+ affinity of CHP2 increased markedly upon complex formation with the NHE1 fragment aa 515–545 . Consistently , the release of 45Ca2+ from the complex was much slower than that from CHP2 alone . The interaction between EF-hand and Ca2+ ions in CHP2 is a little stronger than that in CHP1 . Increases in the affinity for Ca2+ by interacting with target proteins have also been reported for other Ca2+-binding proteins . As reported before , the Ca2+-binding affinity for calmodulin CaM was increased 16-to 38-fold upon interaction with myosin light chain kinase Olwin et al. 1984 , 2.6-fold with myristoylated alanine-rich protein kinase C substrate peptide Johnson et al. 1996 , and 75-fold with the CaM-binding peptide in calcineurin A CNA Stemmer Klee 1994 . Figure 5A , B showed that interactions between CHP2-GFP and NHE1 were affected by different concentrations of Ca2+ ions and EDTA . Our results implicate that tightly bound Ca2+ ions are important structural ele-ments for maintaining the normal conformation of CHPs family and seriously affect the interaction between CHP2 and NHE1 . For the modest differ-ences in Ca2+ bound between these two isoforms , how could we account for the functional differences of CHP1 and 2 ? As we know , high expression of CHP2 is mainly restricted in tumor cells , whereas CHP1 is widely expressed in various cells . The tissue-specific expression might contribute to their functional difference . Moreover , there is only 61 % identity in amino acid sequence , and some other specific motifs of these two proteins might also take part in determining their distinctive functions . The NES of CHP2 is a kind of low leucine-type NES motif Nagita et al. 2003 . This is different from canonical NES signal that have high leucine contents in some typical nuclear-exported molecules , such as Rev Fischer et al. 1995 and mitogen-activated pro-tein kinase kinase MAPKK Fukuda et al. 1996 . Only one functional NES aa 137–148 was identified in CHP2 , although several studies have reported two putative NES Nagita et al. 2003 . Experiments of point mutations showed that this NES motif is important for the proper intracellular distribution of CHP2 . The NES sequence of CHP2 is also con-served in CHP1 and CNB Nagita et al. 2003 . The intracellular distributions of all these proteins might also be controlled by NES signal . The only functional NES of CHP2 is located in the carboxyl-terminal a-helix of the EF-hands and the flanking region . Phospholipase C-d1 also has a typical NES sequence in its EF-hand domain , which is located at a position similar to that of CHP1 and CHP2 Yamaga et al. 1999 . These observations imply that many other EF-hand proteins might also possess a functional NES as reported by Nagita et al. 2003 . We have demonstrated that CHP2 protects cells from serum deprivation–induced death Pang et al. 2002 . Several reports also confirm the result that wild-type CHP2 could enhance the proliferation capacity of tumor cells Jin et al. 2007 Li et al. 2008 , although the effect is less than NES mutation variant CHP2-NESm , Fig. 7 . No obvious change of NHE1 expression was observed in CHP2-transfected cells , so the effect of CHP2 on proliferation might be from its role on NHE1 activity Jin et al. 2007 . NHE1 is acti-vated only upon cytosolic acidification in normal cells , whereas in transformed cells NHE1 is hyperacti-vated even at resting pHi Kim et al. 2009 . CHP2 appears to be exclusively expressed in transformed cells . So the activation of NHE1 by CHP2 might be a key mechanism for the high pHi in these abnormal cells . Both CHP1 and CHP2 could increase the pHi of cells . There is little difference in pHi regulation between them except for under the serum-free cul-ture condition Pang et al. 2002 . At normal condi-tions , modest difference in proliferation of these two isoforms was also detected data was not shown . Previous reports have shown that there are two pathways for CHPs in regulating the function of NHE1 in cells . First , CHP1 plays an essential role in the stabilization of NHE1 for reaching of NHE1 to the plasma membrane Matsushita et al. 2007 . Second , CHPs confer ability to NHE1 to maintain a high exchange activity on the plasma membrane . The for-mer and our present studies show that all of these above biological processes require a direct physical interaction between CHP1 ? 2 and NHE1 via the bind-ing site of CHP1 ? 2 in the juxtamembrane region within the carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic domain of NHE1 , which was shown by the co-localization of GFP-tagged protein Fig. 5C , co-immunoprecipita-tion Fig. 5A , B and crystallographic analysis . Behav-iors of NHE1 regulated by CHPs , such as translocation , stabilization and activity , happen in some limited cell compartments , such as endoplasmic reticulum , plasma membrane and cytoplasm Pang et al. 2001 , 2002 , 2004 Ammar et al. 2006 . So , it must be another case for CHP2 accumulated into nucleus , irrelevant to NHE1 , regulating tumor cell proliferation , because the different subcellular distribution contributes to the loss of direct physical interaction of CHP2-NESm with NHE1 . Nuclear CHP2-NESm could induce much greater proliferation activity than wild-type CHP2 . It implicates that another NES-dependent pathway for CHP2 regulates the proliferation . Although the molecular pathways have not been elucidated , it should be noticed that CHP2 might regulate proliferation by different mech-anisms . CHP2 could enhance oncogenic potential of HEK293 cells via activating the calcineurin ? nuclear factor of activated T-cells NFAT signaling pathway by increasing nuclear accumulation of NFATc3 Li et al. 2008 . Over-expression of DRAK2 , an apop-tosis-inducing protein kinase , induces the nuclear accumulation of CHP1 from cytoplasm Kuwahara et al. 2003 . CHP1 exports to the cytoplasm in an NES-dependent manner after entering the nucleus Nagita et al. 2003 . These reports give us clues to further study the mechanism how the nuclear CHP2 regulates the proliferation of cancer cells . CHP2 might transport into nucleus by forming complex with other partners or by forming functional complex with other proteins later in the nucleus . In the extended work , using CHP2 as ‘bait’ , melanoma antigen-D1 MAGE-D1 , an apoptosis-related protein , was screened by yeast two-hybrid system . MAGE-D1 has been showed to regulate proliferation , migration and invasion of breast cancer cells Du et al. 2009 , HeLa cells and human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line BEL7402 Shen et al. 2007 . Co-expression of both CHP2 and MAGE-D1 in COS-7 cells existed around or accumu-lated in the nucleus . Meanwhile , many EF-hand Ca2+-binding proteins are also known to regulate the functions of their target proteins in response to cyto-solic Ca2+ mobilization . CHP1 regulates DRAK2 activity as a result of a conformational change in the DRAK2 ? CHP complex depending on the intracellular Ca2+ concentration Kuwahara et al. 2003 . CHP2 enhances the oncogenic potential of HEK293 cells by activating the calcineurin ? NFAT signaling pathway , and the dephosphorylation and nuclear translocation of NFAT are sensitive to the increasing intracellular Ca2+ flux Kim Usachev 2009 . Further studies are presently under way to investigate the role of cytosolic Ca2+ in the proliferation of CHP2 on cancer cells via NES-mediated subcellular location . Together , these results show that CHP2 is translo-cated into nucleus and that CHP2-induced cell growth is augmented with NES mutation in HeLa cells . In conclusion , our study provides sufficient evidence that CHP2 interacts with NHE1 in a Ca2+ - dependent manner to regulate NHE1 activity and also enhances cell proliferation via its nuclear accumula-tion controlled by NES . These results provide new insight into our understanding about the role of CHP2 in tumor cell growth . But detailed understand-ing of NES-controlled CHP2 in tumorigenesis still needs to be further studied . Experimental procedures Materials 45CaCl2 was purchased from Dupont-NEN Boston , MA , USA . The rabbit polyclonal antibodies against CHP2 and NHE1 were made by us as described previously . All other chemicals were of the highest purity available . Cell cultures and plasmid transfection The exchanger-deficient cell line PS120 Pouyssegur et al. 1984 , HeLa cell line and corresponding transfectants were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium DMEM Life Technologies Inc. , Rockville , MD , USA containing 25 mM NaHCO3 and supplemented with 10 % v ? v fetal calf serum , penicillin 50 units ? mL , and streptomycin 50 lg ? mL at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 95 % air and 5 % CO2 . Each plas-mid construct 20 lg was transfected into PS120 cells or HeLa cells 5 · 105 cells ? 100-mm dish by the calcium phos-phate coprecipitation technique and stable clones for NHE1 and its mutant constructs were selected by repetitive H+-kill-ing selection procedures . For the stable over-expression of GFP-tagged CHP2 fusion protein variants , single clones expressing proteins were isolated by monitoring GFP fluores-cence under a confocal fluorescence microscope BioRad as a marker after selection with G418 . Construction of expression vectors for NHE1 and CHP2 variants The cDNA for CHP2 was obtained from human blood by reverse transcriptase-PCR based on the reported sequence . Plasmids carrying cDNAs for human NHE1 , CHP2 and their mutants containing unique restriction enzyme sites all cloned into the mammalian expression vector pECE . All these constructs were produced by means of the polymerase chain reaction PCR -based strategy . PCR fragments were digested and cloned into the appropriate restriction enzyme sites of vector pEGFP-N1 Clontech , Palo Alto , CA , USA for GFP-tagged CHP2 fusion protein or its mutant forms in NES motif by means of the PCR-based method . The primary sequences of all constructs were confirmed by sequencing with an automatic DNA sequencer—ABI-PRISM DNA sequencer model 3100 Applied Biosystems , Foster City , CA , USA . Protein expression and purification Recombinant histidine-tagged CHP2 proteins were produced in E. coli BL21-Star Invitrogen , San Diego , CA , USA trans-formed with pET11 carrying the cDNA encoding CHP2 con-taining the C-terminal six histidine residues as described previously . The complex of CHP2 aa 1–196 with its binding region aa 515–545 in NHE1 was expressed and purified essen-tially similar to the methods for CHP1 and NHE1 described previously Pang et al. 2004 . Briefly , the cytoplasmic region aa 515–545 of NHE1 was cloned into the vector pET24 and co-expressed with His-tagged CHP2 in E. coli in the presence of ampicillin and kanamycin . Recombinant proteins were then all recovered in the soluble fraction and partially purified by pas-sage through a Ni2+ affinity resin column ProBond Invitro-gen according to the manufacturer’s protocol . Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting were carried out essentially as described previously . Briefly , cells were solubi-lized with 1 % Triton X-100 in a solution of 150 mM NaCl , 10 mM hydroxyethyl piperazine ethanesulfonic acid HEPES ? Tris pH 7.4 and protease inhibitors . Cell lysates were incu-bated with respective antibodies and protein A Sepharose . After centrifugation , precipitated materials were separated on 7.5 % or 12 % polyacrylamide gels and electrophoretically trans-ferred to Immobilon membranes Millipore .

21392187	Fukuoka 812-8582 , Japan Introduction The cell surface density of transmembrane proteins , such as transporters and receptors , is regulated by endocytosis . The endocytosis signals located in the cytoplasmic domain are recognized by specific adap-tor molecules and subsequently internalized from the plasma membrane PM Piper Katzmann 2007 . One such signal that post-translationally conjugates to lysine residues located in the cytoplasmic domain is ubiquitin Hicke 2001 . Several receptor tyrosine Communicated by Noboru Mizushima *Correspondence fujita @ bioc.phar.kyushu-u.ac.jp due to rapid degradation and deubiquitylation , it is hard to detect the ubiquitylated forms of transmem-brane proteins , which are on the way to MVBs ? lysosomes . Vps4 , an AAA-ATPase , is involved in an endoso-mal membrane transport Babst et al. 1997 Bishop Woodman 2000 Yoshimori et al. 2000 Fujita et al. 2003 . Based on the ESCRT model in yeast , the deubiquitylation enzyme Doa4 is recruited to endo-somes by ESCRT-III Amerik et al. 2000 and thereby removes the ubiquitin tag from the cargo before entry into the inner vesicles of MVBs Piper Katzmann 2007 . Once the deubiquitylation process is completed , Vps4p catalyzes the dissociation of ESCRT complexes from the membrane , resulting in the release of the subunits into the cytoplasm for further rounds of MVB sorting . In this study , we first examined whether a dominant-negative form of SKD1 ? Vps4B , SKD1 E235Q , affects ubiquitin-medi-ated sorting of proteins in mammalian cells . We found that over-expression of SKD1 E235Q drasti-cally enhanced ubiquitylation and altered the intracel-lular localization of ubiquitylated proteins to aberrant endosomes , EQ compartments . Then , we succeeded in identifying a subset of membrane proteins that are ubiquitylated in cells expressing SKD1 E235Q , using a combination of affinity purification with an anti-ubiquitin antibody and proteomics . Here , we have focused on the physiological signifi-cance of ubiquitylation of transferrin receptor TfR that we found by the proteomics . TfR is mainly responsible for the uptake of transferrin Tf -bound iron from plasma to cells of peripheral tissue Hamil-ton et al. 1979 . The extracellular domain of TfR binds Fe III -Tf at the PM , while the cytoplasmic domain contains a canonical signal for endocytosis , YXXF motif Collawn et al. 1990 . Subsequently , the Fe III -Tf ? TfR complex is internalized at the PM through clathrin-coated pits and transported to early endosomes Hopkins Trowbridge 1983 . Acidifi-cation at early endosomes promotes a conformational change in both Fe III -Tf and TfR and results in the release of iron Dautry-Varsat et al. 1983 . An apo-Tf ? TfR complex recycles back to the PM through sorting and recycling endosomes Ciechanover et al. 1983 . The synthesis of TfR is regulated by iron and iron-regulatory proteins IRP1 and IRP2 IRPs , the so-called IRP response Owen Kuhn 1987 . When the supply of iron is limited , IRPs bind to iron-regu-latory elements IREs located in the 3¢-untranslated region of TfR mRNAs and stabilize them . In con-trast , an excess of iron leads to either inactivation of IRP1 or degradation of IRP2 , resulting in the destabilization of TfR mRNA Pantopoulos 2004 Rouault 2006 . While the trafficking routes and iron-regulated synthesis of TfR have been studied extensively , the regulation of TfR’s turnover is poorly understood . Here , we provide the first evidence of iron-induced ubiquitylation and lysosomal degrada-tion of TfR , which we propose is a part of a novel iron-homeostasis system . SKD1 E235Q induced accumulation of ubiquitin conjugates in aberrant endosomal structures , EQ compartments Over-expression of dominant-negative mutant form of Vps4 impedes an endosomal membrane transport and induces a formation of aberrant endosomes , most likely as a result of an abrogation of proper recycling of ESCRT subunits from the endosomal membranes Babst et al. 1997 Bishop Woodman 2000 Yoshi-mori et al. 2000 Fujita et al. 2003 . Indeed , dysfunc-tion of either Vps4 or some of the ESCRT-III subunits resulted in an accumulation of ubiquitylated cargos in MVB Bishop et al. 2002 Katoh et al. 2003 Kobayashi et al. 2005 Lin et al. 2005 . We first reconfirmed the effect of a dominant-negative SKD1 E235Q on the intracellular localization of ubiquitin conjugates by conducting immunofluo-rescence IF analyses . In control cells , ubiquitin con-jugates detected with FK2 antibody Fujimuro et al. 1994 , which specifically recognizes poly-ubiquitylated proteins , were located in both the nucleus and cyto-plasm Fig. 1A control . In contrast , the introduction of an adenovirus that expresses SKD1 E235Q led to a redistribution of ubiquitin conjugates to aberrant endosomes EQ compartments Fig. 1A EQ . Nei-ther mock infection data not shown nor treatment with a mixture of lysosomal protease inhibitors Fig. 1A leupeptin ? pepstatin altered the distribution of ubiquitin conjugates . MG132 , a proteasome in-hibitor , significantly enhanced the accumulation of ubiquitylated proteins in the cytosol but not in the en-dosomal ? lysosomal compartments Fig. 1A MG132 . Cotransfection of FLAG-tagged ubiquitin with GFP-SKD1 E235Q also indicated a redistribution of FLAG-tagged ubiquitin to EQ compartments Fig. 1B upper panels . Because wild-type SKD1 gave a diffused distribution of FLAG-tagged ubiquitin to both the cytoplasm and nucleus Fig. 1B lower panels , the accumulation of ubiquitylated proteins in the endosomes ? lysosomes depends on the SKD1 ATPase activity . Cotransfection of red fluorescent protein RFP -tagged ubiquitin RFP-Ub with GFP-SKD1 E235Q Fig. 1C upper panels , but not with wild-type GFP-SKD1 Fig. 1C middle panels , also caused a redistribution of RFP-Ub to EQ compart-ments . Intriguingly , a mutant form of RFP-Ub , RFP-Ub G76V , which lacks conjugation activity , localized to the cytoplasm regardless of the expression of GFP-SKD1 E235Q or formation of EQ compart-ments Fig. 1C lower panels . These results suggest that the accumulation of RFP-Ub directly reflects an enhancement of ubiquitin-conjugation and is not because of the aggregation of the large fluorescent-tagged protein . Consistent with the IF analyses , Western blotting revealed that SKD1 E235Q induced an accumulation of ubiquitylated proteins , which was indistinguishable from that detected in the cells treated with MG132 Fig. 2A upper panel . Neither mock infection Fig. 2A lane EQ ? -nor treatment with lysosomal protease inhibitors Fig. 2A lane Leu ? Pep , increased the ubiquitylation . The accumulation of ubiquitylated proteins in the cells expressing SKD1 E235Q is not because of interference with the proteasome activity , because in contrast to MG132 , SKD1 E235Q did not stabilize Cip ? Waf1 that is effectively degraded by proteasomes Sheaff et al. 2000 Fig. 2A lower panel . Subcellular fractionation revealed that mem-brane-associated proteins rather than cytosolic pro-teins were efficiently ubiquitylated in the cells expressing SKD1 E235Q Fig. 2B . To identify these proteins , we applied a combination of affinity purifi-cation of ubiquitylated proteins and liquid chroma-tography ? tandem mass spectrometry LC–MS ? MS Hatakeyama et al. 2005 Matsumoto et al. 2005 . A total membranous fraction prepared from either con-trol cells or cells expressing SKD1 E235Q was solu-bilized with 0.5 % TritonX-100 and subjected to affinity purification with FK2 antibody . Silver staining revealed that the extracts of cells expressing SKD1 E235Q contained larger amounts of ubiquity-lated proteins than the extracts from the control cells Fig. 2C FK2 elution . The eluted proteins prepared from the cells expressing SKD1 E235Q were subse-quently digested with trypsin and subjected to LC–MS ? MS analyses to determine the amino acid sequences of the peptides derived from trypsin diges - tion . Using the MASCOT score’s criterion , we found 22 membrane proteins that are potentially ubiquitylat-ed by the expression of SKD1 E235Q Table 1 . Of these , Na+ , K+ ATPase a-subunit Coppi Guidotti 1997 , Nedd4-interacting protein 2 NDFIP2 Shear-win-Whyatt et al. 2004 , connexin43 Leithe Rive-dal 2007 and SCAMP3 Aoh et al. 2009 have been reported to be ubiquitylated previously however , the rest have not . Intriguingly , two ‘signature peptides’ Fig. 2D cartoon were identified , one derived from integral membrane protein 2B ITM2B and the other from TfR Fig. 2E , F . Both signature peptides are located in the cytoplasmic region where ubiqu-itin-interacting molecules , such as ESCRT com-plexes , can interact . There are six lysine residues in the cytoplasmic region of ITM2B Pittois et al. 1998 , among which , only Lys13 indicated a signature of ubiquitylation . ITM2B might have three other poten-tial sites of ubiquitylation however , peptide frag-ment s containing Lys17 , Lys21 and Lys39 were not recovered . TfR has four lysine residues in the cyto-plasmic region Schneider et al. 1984 . One peptide , corresponding to Leu40-Lys60 , was recovered , and it had the characteristics of the signature peptide . Because Lys39 and Lys60 indicated trypsin sensitivity and Lys53 did not acquire a di-glycine remnant , Lys58 is likely the only site of TfR modified by ubiquitin in the cells expressing SKD1 E235Q Fig. 2F . Plasmid construction , transfection , selection of cells and adenoviral infection It is of interest if the membrane proteins identified in our analysis are indeed ubiquitylated in the cells expressing SKD1 E235Q . To validate this , we puri-fied ubiquitylated proteins with FK2 antibody from either un-infected cells or infected cells with the ade-novirus expressing GFP-SKD1 E235Q and probed them with specific antibodies to some identified pro-teins Fig. 3A–F . The detection of ladders in the cells expressing SKD1 E235Q is direct evidence of ubiq-uitylation . We revealed that connexin43 , a-subunit of IFN-c-R , ITM2B , NDFIP2 and TfR were efficiently ubiquitylated on the expression of SKD1 E235Q Fig. 3A–F blotting . Western blotting of ITM2B showed doublet bands , one a processed form 37 kDa and the other a precursor form 40 kDa Kim et al. 1999 Vidal et al. 1999 Fig. 3D . An ubiquitylated ITM2B was effectively recovered with the FK2 antibody in the cells expressing SKD1 E235Q Fig. 3D . Among the FK2-recovered bands , those marked by asterisks corresponded in size to the nonubiquitylated forms of ITM2B . This suggests that ubiquitylated ITM2B might form homo-oligomers with nonubiquitylated ITM2B . The faster-migrating bands might correspond to partially degraded ITM2B . Immunoprecipitation with the FK2 antibody revealed that TfR was ubiquitylated in the cells expressing SKD1 E235Q , but not in control cells or the cells treated with MG132 Fig. 3E .

Reciprocal experiments , i.e. immunoprecipitation of TfR and probing with ubiquitin antibody , confirmed the specific ubiquitylation of TfR in the cells express - ing SKD1 E235Q data not shown . Because the bands corresponding to ubiquitylated TfR had a ladder-like appearance , it is likely that TfR acquired poly-ubiquitylation at Lys58 . Next , we tested whether the localization of the identified membrane proteins is altered by the expres-sion of SKD1 E235Q . IF analyses revealed that both connexin43 and IFN-c-R localized to the PM in control U251 cells however , they were significantly accumulated inside the cells , EQ compartments , aber-rant endosomes that are caused by over-expression of SKD1 E235Q Fig. 3A , B . As previously reported Shearwin-Whyatt et al. 2004 , NDFIP2 was mainly distributed in the Golgi ? TGN area Fig. 3C control . The localization of NDFIP2 shifted from the TGN to EQ compartments by the expression of SKD1 E235Q Fig. 3C EQ , arrows . ITM2B was mainly present in the Golgi ? TGN areas and colocalized with GM130 Golgi marker Fig. 3D control . Expression of SKD1 E235Q caused a redistribution of ITM2B from the Golgi ? TGN region to aberrant endosomes Fig. 3D EQ , arrows . Consistent with the previous reports , the receptors and membrane proteins we have tested are apparently accumulated in EQ com-partments . However , the localization of the receptors was not completely consistent with that of mutant form of SKD1 ? Vps4 . Most likely , mutant form of SKD1 ? Vps4 , together with ESCRT proteins , is accu-mulated in a subset of endosomes and results in a depletion of them from other endosomes . This may reflect the limited colocalization of receptors with If the accumulation of these membrane proteins in EQ compartments is directly coupled with their ubiq-uitylation , a depletion of free ubiquitin should restore that . MG132 is known to cause a depletion of free ubiquitin , because ubiquitin is recycled from the ub-iquitylated proteins via proteasomal deubiquitylation activity Mimnaugh et al. 1997 . We examined the effect of MG132 on the free ubiquitin pool and estimated that MG132 reduced it to less than 50 % of the control Fig. 3F blotting . Over-expression of SKD1 E235Q alone did not affect the amount of free ubiquitin . Interestingly , when the cells expressing SKD1 E235Q were treated with MG132 for the last 12 h , the distribution of ubiquitylated proteins shifted from EQ compartments to the cytosol Fig. 3F IF EQ + MG132 , ubiquitin . Concomitantly , the for-mation of EQ compartments was impaired and GFP-SKD1 E235Q localized to fine punctuate structures that were smaller than typical EQ compartments Fig. 3F IF EQ + MG132 , SKD1 E235Q . Then , we tested the effect of MG132 on connexin43 , IFN-c-R , ITM2B , NDFIP2 and TfR in the cells express-ing SKD1 E235Q . As expected , the depletion of free ubiquitin by MG132 significantly impaired their ubiquitylation Fig. 3A–E blotting EQ + MG and accumulation in EQ compartments Fig. 3A–C , E IF EQ + MG . These results suggested that the accu-mulation of connexin43 , IFN-c-R , ITM2B , NDFIP2 and TfR in EQ compartments is directly coupled with their ubiquitylation . We also confirmed the ubiquitylation of Caveolin-1 and Jagged-1 by Western blotting Fig. S1A , D in Supporting information , and the accumulation in EQ compartments of GPR56 and integrin-aV by IF ana-lyses Fig. S1B , C in Supporting information . While the ubiquitylation of caveolin-1 was clearly observed , the ladder formed could not be simply explained by poly-or multiubiquitylation , i.e. , some bands indi-cated distances of 8 kDa Fig. S1A in Supporting information . As U251 cells continually expressed phosphorylated caveolin-1 data not shown , the bands may be derived from a combination of ubiqui-tylation and phosphorylation . Intriguingly , the locali-zation of caveolin-1 was less affected by the expression of SKD1 E235Q Fig. 3E . Interestingly , ubiquitylated Jagged-1 was detected even in the lysate of the cells expressing SKD1 E235Q Fig. S1D in supporting Information . Ubiquitylated Jagged-1 was also recovered from the control cell lysate . These results suggest the ubiquitylation of Jagged-1 to occur constitutively . GPR56-GFP was localized to the PM and some internal punctate structures , possibly the TGN and endosomes Fig. S1B control in Support-ing Information . Cotransfection with wild-type SKD1 did not alter the distribution of GPR56-GFP however , SKD1 E235Q caused its redistribution from the PM to EQ compartments . Integrin-aV was mainly found in the PM in U251 human glioma cells . However , it redistributed to the inside of the aberrant endosomes , enlarged intracellular vacuolar structures , in the cells expressing SKD1 E235Q Fig. S1C in Supporting Information . Table 2 summarizes these results with the predicted mem-brane topology and potential ubiquitylation site s . Taken together , these results indicate that 9 of 22 identified proteins are potentially redistributed to EQ compartments in an ubiquitylation-dependent man-ner . This validation score may increase because at least two membrane proteins Na+ , K+ ATPase a-subunit and SCAMP3 , those we have identified in this study , are already shown to be ubiquitylated by other groups . Our data indicate TfR to have the potential to be ubiq-uitylated , but how is it involved in iron homeostasis ? To investigate the physiological significance of the ubiquitylation of TfR , we first examined the expres-sion of TfR in cells treated with excess iron supplied as ferric ammonium citrate ? FAC 30 lM by Western blotting Fig. 4A . In the absence of FAC , lysosomal protease inhibitors , leupeptin and pepstatin A LP , slightly recovered TfR levels ·1.2 relative to control . In contrast , in the presence of FAC , cellular expression of TfR was significantly reduced ·0.4 relative to con-trol mostly by an IRP response that destabilizes the mRNA of TfR as previously reported Owen Kuhn 1987 , however , LP significantly restored that ·2.0 relative to FAC+ , suggesting that an excess of iron induces degradation of TfR in lysosomes . Because FAC might affect both the translation and degradation of TfR , the values obtained for iron-induced degrada - tion might be over-estimated . To further validate the involvement of lysosomes in TfR degradation , we have applied lysosomal inhibitors in combination with the pulse-chase experiments . In consistent with the data of Fig. 4A , LP treatment restored the degradation of TfR either in the absence or in the presence of FAC GPR56 70 Type III 4 Caveolin-1 21 Peripheral 8 ITM2B 40 Type II 6 TfR 80 Type II 4 Jagged-1§ 180 Type I 14 INF-c -R 90 Type I 15 a subunit NDFIP2 37 Type III 3 Integrin aV 120 Type I 1 Connexin 43 43 Type III 24 Fig. 4B . FAC showed marginal but significant effect on the degradation of TfR . Then , we examined the rate of degradation i.e. , half-life of TfR by pulse-chase experiments Fig. 4C . We generated and used the rabbit antibody against human TfR Fig. S3 in Supporting Information . Newly synthesized TfR is cotranslationally modified with N-linked oligosaccha-rides 85 kDa in the ER . Subsequently , it is trans - ported to the Golgi and processed to a mature form 93 kDa within 1 h . From that point , TfR began to decrease . In the absence of FAC , TfR constantly decreased with a half-life of 33.0 h in U251 cells . On the other hand , treatment of the cells with FAC during the chase period resulted in a biphasic curve . In the early chase period 1–8 h , FAC treatment accelerated degradation of TfR with an apparent half-life of fold-increase TfR 12.5 h . However , later in the chase period 8–20 h , the degradation was attenuated and the apparent half-life was 35.0 h , almost indistinguishable from that in control cells . Most likely , upregulation of ferritin Hentze et al. 1987 , which sequesters iron from the intracellular labile iron pool Macara et al. 1972 , accounts for the biphasic kinetics of TfR degradation in the cells treated with FAC . Consistent with this predic-tion , FAC treatment rapidly increased the cellular level of ferritin by the IRP response that resumes translation of ferritin mRNA that contains IRE in the 5¢-untrans - lated region . Ferritin expression , estimated by Western blotting , was twofold higher than that in untreated cells at 4 h and sevenfold higher at 8 h Fig. 4D . We next examined whether the ubiquitylation of TfR is enhanced in the presence of excess iron . Immunoprecipitation of TfR from COS cells trans-fected with a plasmid encoding 3XFLAG-tagged ubiquitin and Western blotting revealed an FLAG-reactive smear bands whose apparent molecular weight was greater than that of TfR , suggesting TfR to be polyubiquitylated Fig. 5A upper panel . LP slightly increased the ubiquitylation of TfR , suggest-ing the ubiquitylation and subsequent degradation in lysosomes to occur constitutively . As expected , the ubiquitylation of TfR was increased in the cells trea-ted with FAC . The combination of FAC and LP fur-ther enhanced the recovery of ubiquitylated TfR . Then , we tried to detect the ubiquitylation of TfR with endogenous ubiquitin , instead of using trans-fected FLAG-ubiquitin Fig. 5B . The addition of N-ethylmaleimide NEM , a strong inhibitor of deubiquitylation enzyme s , to the lysis buffer , seemed to aid in the detection endogenously ubiquitylated TfR . Immunopercipitation of TfR and Western blot-ting with anti-ubiquitin antibodies FK2 Fig. 5B , P4D1 data not shown indicated a ladder formation of TfR , suggesting ubiquitylation . Consistent with the results of FLAG-ubiquitin transfection , ubiquityla-tion of TfR was enhanced in the presence of FAC and LP . Interestingly , ubiquitylation of TfR in the cells expressing SKD1 E235Q was much more extensive than that induced with iron , suggesting that SKD1 E235Q significantly impaired deubiquitylation at the MVB pathway . Other membrane proteins , IFN-c-R and connexin43 , were not ubiquitylated with FAC treatment Fig. S2 in Supporting Informa-tion , suggesting that the FAC-induced ubiquitylation was specific to TfR . Collectively , our results indicate that an excess of iron promotes the ubiquitylation , and subsequent degradation in lysosomes , of TfR . Finally , to corroborate these conclusions , we established cells stably expressing a myc-tagged TfR WT and a lysine-less mutant 4KR , in which all 4 lysine residues located at the cytoplasmic region are replaced with alanine residues . Because the TfR cDNAs myc-tagged , WT and 4KR ones do not contain any IREs , they did not alter the expression of myc-TfR with an excess of iron Fig. 4A in Sup-porting Information . IF microscopy revealed that the localization of WT and 4KR was indistinguishable from that of endogenous TfR Fig. 6A in Supporting Information . These results suggest that lysine residues in the cytoplasmic regions are not essential for the B C intracellular localization of TfR . As expected , myc-tagged-WT-TfR , but not 4KR-TfR , was ubiquity-lated in the presence of excess iron Fig. 6C in Supporting Information . Using these stable cell lines , we examined the degradation rate of myc-TfRs WT and 4KR by conducting pulse-chase experiments . The remaining radioactive bands at chase time 4 and 20 h , respectively , were measured in the absence or presence of FAC 150 lM . The data were repre - sented as % of remaining at 20 h using the bands at 4 h as 100 % Dashed lines . Unexpectedly , the per-centages of remaining of myc-tagged TfRs were almost the same between WT and 4KR mutant 80 % and not affected by the addition of FAC Fig. 6D , E Control siRNA in Supporting Informa-tion . It is most certainly that exogenously introduced myc-TfRs forms heterodimer with endogenous TfR . To avoid this , we challenged to deplete endogenous TfR by transfection of the siRNA specifically tar-geting 3¢-untranslated region of TfR . Western blot analyses revealed that expression of endogenous TfR was significantly reduced in HeLa cells Fig. S4B in Supporting Information . In the cells stably expressing myc-TfRs WT and 4KR , the bands detected with anti-TfR antibody were slightly reduced . However , the bands detected with anti-myc antibody were not altered , suggesting that this siRNA only targets endogenous TfR but not exogenous ones those do not contain 3¢-untranslated region Fig . S4B in Sup-porting Information . IF analyses also clearly revealed that this siRNA only targets endogenous TfR but not exogenous ones Fig. 4C in Supporting Informa-tion . Using this siRNA , we further characterized degradation of myc-tagged WT-and 4KR-TfRs , those potentially form homodimers , respectively . The data clearly revealed that in the absence of endo-genous TfR , the remaining of WT-TfR 70 % was much less than that of 4KR-TfR 110 90 % Fig. 6D , E endTfR siRNA , suggesting that lysine-less mutant TfR is quite stable . Discussion In this study , we have revealed the accumulation of ubiquitylated proteins in mammalian class E vps com-partments , EQ compartments , in U251 human glioma cells . An accumulation of ubiquitylated proteins in aberrant endosomes , possibly akin to the EQ compart-ments , is also induced by the over-expression of other class E Vps proteins , such as Hrs , Snf7 and CHMP4b Bishop et al. 2002 Katoh et al. 2003 Kobayashi et al . 2005 Lin et al. 2005 . One explanation for the accu-mulation of ubiquitylated proteins , based on the ESC-RT model , is that the mammalian counterpart of Doa4 Amerik et al. 2000 , a deubiquitylation enzyme , is recruited to endosomes with ESCRT-III proteins and then dissociated via the ATPase activity of SKD1 ? Vps4 . If the proper recycling of the deubiquity-lation enzyme s was inhibited by over-expression of SKD1 E235Q and other ESCRT-III proteins , the deubiquitylation process would be abrogated and as a result the ubiquitylated proteins would be accumulated in endosomes . Two mammalian deubiquitylation enzymes , UBPY Mizuno et al. 2005 Row et al. 2006 and AMSH McCullough et al. 2004 , are the best can-didates for the deubiquitylation enzymes involved in the ESCRT model in mammalian cells . While other groups also have observed an accumu-lation of ubiquitylated proteins in EQ compartments in HEK293 cells Lin et al. 2005 , they have not referred to which proteins are specifically ubiquitylated . We have succeeded in identifying 22 membrane-associated proteins that are possibly ubiquitylated in an SKD1 ATPase activity-dependent manner Table 1 . We fur-ther showed that nine of them are indeed ubiquitylated and ? or redistributed to EQ compartments . Most of our data indicated the ubiquitylation of endogenous proteins by endogenous ubiquitin i.e. , not over-expression by transfection thus , we assume that their ubiquitylation occurs under physiological conditions . It is likely that the ubiquitylation is directly coupled with trafficking to and degradation in lysosomes . The deple-tion of free ubiquitin by MG132 is known to impair the ubiquitylation and endocytosis of receptors , such as Fcc receptor IIA Mero et al. 2006 . Indeed , we have revealed that MG132 impaired the ubiquitylation and accumulation in EQ compartments , of connexin43 , IFN-c-R , NDFIP2 , ITM2B and TfR Fig. 3A–F . Other identified proteins those we have not examined in this study may also be ubiquitylated . Further analysis , such as the identification of specific ubiquitin ligases , is needed to understand the physiological significance of the ubiquitylation . In this study , we have suggested the possible involvement of the iron-induced ubiquitylation of TfR in lysosomal degradation . This may be a novel mechanism that is required for iron homeostasis in mammalian cells Fig. 7 . Three lines of evidence support our prediction i the degradation of TfR in lysosomes is marginally but significantly accelerated by an excess of iron ii TfR is ubiquitylated in the presence of excess iron iii in the absence of endogenous TfR , the degradation of 4KR-TfR is significantly impaired . Because the depletion of free ubiquitin alone did not affect the localization or traf-ficking of TfR data not shown , the ubiquitylation of TfR is not essential for the endocytosis . Indeed , a lysine-less TfR 4KR was indistinguishable in locali-zation and iron-uptake activity judged by the IRP response that increases ferritin levels from WT thus , the ubiquitylation of TfR may only be required for the iron-induced down-regulation of TfR . TfR has a long half-life , 33 h in our study therefore , while the IRP response effectively reduces expression of TfR , there may be an alternative mechanism that quickly shuts off iron uptake if the iron concentration is acutely increased . Ubiquitylation of TfR and its sub-sequent delivery to the MVB degradation pathway may be a primary response to reduce the rate of iron uptake from the extracellular space Fig. 7 . Indeed , this response seemed to occur only at early 8 h until the up-regulating ferritin captures the excess iron in the cytoplasm . Pathological stimuli that result in the cells being exposed to an excess of iron may exist . For instance , the ubiquitylation of TfR may occur physiologically in cells of specific tissues , such as reti-culocytes ? red blood cells , to release the receptor via exosomal secretion Johnstone et al. 1987 , 1989 . In many cases , the ubiquitylation of receptors , transporters and channels is enhanced when a ligand is added to the cells Sigismund et al. 2005 . There-fore , it is rational that TfR is ubiquitylated with free iron transported to the cytoplasm by the concerted actions of TfR itself and a divalent metal transporter DMT1 , localized to endosomes . Recently , NDFIP1 and NDFIP2 , together with Atrophin-1-interacting protein 2 AIP2 ? WWP2 , a WW-domain-containing ubiquitin ligase , have been shown to be involved in the down-regulation of DMT1 Foot et al. 2008 . Moreover , hepcidin , a small peptide secreted from the liver , induces the ubiquitylation and degradation of ferroportin , an iron-transporter located at the PM to export excess iron from the cells to the medium Recycling Ubiquitin Degradation Multivesicular body Nemeth et al. 2004 . The hepcidin-induced down-regulation of ferroportin in lysosomes is regulated by the ubiquitin ? MVB pathway De Domenico et al. 2007 . Thus , not only the translational regulation of these iron receptors and transporters by the IRP response but also their ubiquitylation and subsequent degradation in lysosomes must be a housekeeping function to regulate iron homeostasis in higher eukaryotes . If there is an iron-dependent ubiquitin ligase as we propose Fig. 7 , it is of interest to inves-tigate it . A down-regulation of cell surface membrane proteins , including TfR and major histocompatibility complex class I , occurred on the over-expression of membrane-associated RING-CH MARCH ubiqu-itin ligases , related to viral immune evasion proteins Ishido et al. 2000 . Thus , whether the iron-induced ubiquitylation of TfR is mediated by the MARCH family needs to be examined . A detailed analysis of the iron-induced ubiquitylation of TfR should provide useful targets for the treatment of iron disorders .

TfR recycles between the PM and early endosomes and transports Tf carrying Fe3+ to early endosomes . Acidification of early endosomes facilitates the release of Fe3+ rom Tf , a STEAP six-transmembrane epithelial antigen of the prostate family protein reduces Fe3+ to Fe2+ , and Fe2+ is trans-ported into the cytoplasm by DMT1 , a member of the NRAMP natural resistance-associated macrophage protein family of metal ion transporters . There is an unidentified intracellular labile iron Fe2+ pool in the cytoplasm . When iron is excess , it up-regulates ferritin expression and down-regulates TfR expression via IRP responses . We propose that before the excess iron is captured and sequestered by ferritin , it induces the ubiquitylation of TfR by using unknown ubiquitin ligase s , whose expression or catalytic activity may be controlled by the iron concentration . Ubiquitylated TfR may be recognized by ESCRT complexes and delivered to inner vesicles of MVBs for degradation in lysosomes . 
21501345	Shuhei So , Kohji Miyahara and Yasumi Ohshima* Introduction The nematode C. elegans is known to be a good model for studying body size control because the entire gene set of the animal is showed The C. elegans Sequencing Consortium 1998 , and the cell number and cell lineages are kept in strict control Sulston 1988 . Also , many mutants with an abnormal body size have been isolated . In addition , we designed an automated device to measure body length , diameters and volume of a worm , which for the first time provided precise measurement of the worm body size Hirose et al. 2003 . By using this system , we isolated large body size mutants and characterized both large and small body size mutants Hirose et al. 2003 Nagamatsu Ohshima 2004 Watanabe et al. 2005 , 2007 . The final body size of an organism is determined both by genetic factors and by environmental factors . As genetic factors for body size control , TGFb and insulin ? insulin-like growth factor IGF pathways are known to be important in various animals Conlon Raff 1999 Nagamatsu Ohshima 2004 . In C. elegans , the mutants in the TGFb pathway members such as DBL-1 ligand , SMA-6 and DAF-4 receptors and SMA-2 , SMA-3 , SMA-4 Smad transcription factors are all small Estevez et al. 1993 Savage et al. 1996 Morita et al. 1999 . However , the daf-2 gene encoding the insulin ? IGF-1 receptor in the worm regulates highly pleiotropic actions , which control develop-ment , aging and metabolism including glucose homeo-stasis and fat storage Kenyon et al. 1993 Kimura et al. 1997 Ogg et al. 1997 Riddle Albert 1997 Kenyon 2010 , as does insulin ? IGF signaling of mammals Taha Klip 1999 . Although variations in body size are mainly explained by variations in cell number alone in many animals , cell size is also an important factor for body size control in lower animals . The cell size may be lar-gely determined by the ribosome biogenesis and plays an indirect but important role in cell proliferation , as cells must double in size before dividing Jorgensen et al. 2002 . It is known that the insulin ? IGF-1 signal responds to the nutritional state Britton et al. 2002 Ikeya et al. 2002 and then promotes cell growth by stimulating protein synthesis in cooperation with other pathways such as TOR signaling Teleman et al. 2008 Hietakangas Cohen 2009 . Some environmental factors also play a role in body size control as important as the above genetic factors . Food appears to be the most important environmental factor for the determination of the growth and final body size of animals . Small body size phenotypes caused by a nutrient-limited condition have been observed in a wide range of species such as mouse Weindruch et al. 1986 . C. elegans is also known to result in a reduced body size by food limi-tation Lenaerts et al. 2008 Tain et al. 2008 . Although C. elegans is generally grown in the labora-tory using an E. coli strain OP50 as the food source Brenner 1974 Sulston Hodgkin 1988 , a change in the food bacteria leads to a change in the growth rate Avery Shtonda 2003 . We show here that the worms fed on another E. coli strain HB101 increase both final body size and growth rate compared with those fed on OP50 . Also , we measured the body sizes of many worm mutants in both OP50 and HB101 food conditions , and the relationship of the worm sizes between the two food types was analyzed by the regression analysis . To bet-ter understand the mechanisms of the food-dependent body size change , we have also compared the nuclear number , nuclear size and protein contents of the worms between the two food conditions . These find-ings provide interesting insights into the control mechanisms for the body size . Next , we asked which is more important for the determination of the final body size of a worm larval growth or adult growth . To answer this , we switched the food 3 days after hatch , just after becoming an adult . The animals that experienced food switch dis-played a body size intermediate between those of the worms fed on HB101 or OP50 throughout Fig. 1C . These results show that determination of the final body size of the worm is affected by the nutritional states of both larvae and adults . To further characterize the food-dependent body size change , we tested other E. coli strains BL21 , BW25113 and DH5a as the food Fig. 1D . BL21 was the most unfavorable for growth among the bac-teria examined , whereas DH5a and BW25113 made worms grow larger than did OP50 and BL21 . OP50 and BL21 are B strains of E. coli , DH5a and BW25113 are K12 strains , and HB101 is a hybrid of B and K12 but almost K12 . Our results suggest that the strains with the K12 property enhance the worm growth and final body size . OP50 food digestive enzymes downstream of DBL-1 No. 28 Mallo et al. 2002 or downstream of DAF-16 No. 29–31 Murphy et al. 2003 , body shape No. 32 Brenner 1974 and small body size No. 33 , Watana-be et al. 2005 . For all the strains examined , the body size on HB101 was significantly larger than that on OP50 P 0.001 in t-test . We plotted the body sizes on HB101 and those on OP50 Fig. 3A . As the result , we found that the body sizes of the small worm mutants have a tendency to be more suscepti-ble to the change in foods and the R2 coefficient is 0.88 indicating a high correlation Fig. 3A . Interest-ingly , the body sizes of daf-2 e1370 , daf-2 m579 and sgk-1 mutants were similar between OP50 food and HB101 food Table 1 and Fig. 4 , and therefore , their data points are far off the regression line Fig. 3A , No. 6 , 7 and 14 . We also made regression analysis after removing these three mutants as poten-tial outliers . Then , the regression yielded the R2 value of 0.94 , indicating this regression line is more fitted No. in Fig. 3 Strain Volume ± SD nL 1 N2 wild type 2 daf-2 m577 3 daf-2 e1371 4 daf-2 e1368 5 daf-2 m596 6 daf-2 m579 7 daf-2 e1370 8 daf-16 mu86 9 ins-1 tm1888 10 ins-7 tm1907 11 ins-18 tm339 12 akt-1 mg306 13 akt-2 tm812 14 sgk-1 ok538 15 aak-1 tm1944 16 aak-2 gt33 17 dbl-1 nk3 18 sma-6 e1482 19 egl-4 ks61 20 egl-4 ad450 21 eat-2 ad465 22 eat-5 ad1402 Table 1 Continued to the rest of the strains than that obtained for all the data sets . Food-dependent body size change is controlled by the insulin ? IGF-1 signaling pathway The insulin ? IGF-1 signaling is known to be the most important pathway for the metabolism and growth in animals Taha Klip 1999 Britton et al. 2002 Leevers Hafen 2004 . We examined the body sizes of the mutants for the components in the DAF-2 signal pathway in C. elegans , which are shown in Fig. 3B . We found that the body sizes of daf-2 e1370 and daf-2 m579 mutants changed little between OP50 food and HB101 food Table 1 , Fig. 4A , B . Further-more , the growth curve and the growth rate of daf-2 e1370 mutant were similar under both food condi-tions Fig. 4C . It is known that a null mutation in daf-16 , encoding FOXO transcription factor , can sup-press all of the phenotypes caused by a daf-2 mutation Ogg et al. 1997 . We tested whether the daf-16 mu86 mutation suppresses the reduction of food-dependent change caused by the daf-2 e1370 mutation . The daf-16 mutant had a similar body size to that of N2 , and the daf-16 mutation fully sup-pressed the disruption of the food-dependent body size change caused by the daf-2 mutation Fig. 4A , B , indicating that the food-dependent body size change is controlled by the DAF-2 ? DAF-16 pathway . As illustrated in Fig. 3B , insulin-like ligands of the worm activate ? inhibit the DAF-2 receptor , and the downstream signal regulates the DAF-16 transcription factor through phosphorylation by the three protein kinases , AKT-1 , AKT-2 and SGK-1 , in a manner sim-ilar to that in mammals Hietakangas Cohen 2009 Kenyon 2010 . Although a mutant of the ins-7 gene encoding an insulin-like ligand has a reduced food-dependent change in the body size , it is a relatively small reduction compared with that by the daf-2 mutants Table 1 , Fig. 4A , B . There are approximately HB101 8 Body m5965 , m5796 and e13707 . 40 insulin-like ligands in C. elegans , and therefore , these ins genes including the ins-7 may have redundant functions Pierce et al. 2001 Li et al. 2003 . Similarly , AKT-1 and AKT-2 seem to be function-ally redundant . The mutants of the akt-1 and akt-2 genes fed on HB101 are approximately 1.3 times as large as those fed on OP50 in contrast to wild-type worms that are 1.65 times as large Table 1 , Fig. 4A , B . We have tried to construct an akt-1 akt-2 double mutant but the double mutant appeared to be embryonic ? larval lethal or 100 % dauers as reported by others Hertweck et al. 2004 . AKT-1 and AKT-2 are known to physically interact with SGK-1 , a C. elegans homolog of the serum-and glucocorticoid-inducible kinase , which functions in the phosphorylation of DAF-16 transcription factor in parallel to AKTs Hert-weck et al. 2004 . In the DAF-2 signaling of the worm , AKTs have an important role in dauer forma-tion , whereas SGK-1 regulates development , lifespan and stress response Hertweck et al. 2004 . The sgk-1 mutant is very small , and the body sizes and the growth curves of the mutant are almost the same between HB101 and OP50 food conditions Table 1 , Fig. 4A , B . Interestingly , the daf-16 mutation only partially suppressed the defect in the food-dependent body size change caused by the sgk-1 mutation , whereas it completely suppressed the defect caused by the akt-2 mutation Table 1 , Fig. 4A , B . These results show that the DAF-2-DAF-16 signal regulates the food-dependent body size change mainly through the AKT kinases , and the epistatic relationship between the sgk-1 and daf-16 mutations suggests that SGK-1 has another pathway that does not depend on DAF-16 output in this regulation Table 1 , Fig. 4A , B . Food-dependent body size change is probably due to changes in the cell size and protein synthesis Although body size is generally determined by cell size and cell number , variation in body size in mammals is explained by variation in cell number rather than that in cell size Conlon Raff 1999 . However , variation in body size caused by a change in cell size is seen in lower animals such as Drosophila and C. elegans . The chico gene encodes an insulin receptor substrate in the fly and its mutant develops to approximately a half size of that of the wild type Bohni ¨ et al. 1999 . The reduced body size and organ size in the mutant are because of a reduction in both cell number and cell size . In the wing size of the mutant , approximately 30 % of the total reduction is shown to be because of a reduction in cell size . In C. elegans , the change in cell size was found to cause the small body size in the mutants of DBL-1 ? TGFb pathway members and the large body size in the mutant of egl-4 gene encoding cGMP-dependent protein kinases Hirose et al. 2003 Nagamatsu Ohshima 2004 . We asked which is more important for the food-dependent body size change , cell number or cell volume . In C. elegans , the intestinal and hypodermal cells are much larger , which reflect a high degree of the chromosomal ploidy , and they play a much more important role in body size regulation than the other somatic cells carrying diploid nuclei Hedgecock White 1985 . The intestine has 20 cells with a total of 30–34 nuclei and 32 chromosome sets per nucleus 32 C , C means a haploid genome Hedgecock White 1985 . However , the hypodermis has a large multinucleate syncytium hyp7 , which envelops most of the whole body of the animal , as well as oligo-nucleate or mononucleate diploid cells in the head or tail and seam cells Sulston Horvitz 1977 . The syncytial nuclei in the hypodermis undergo endo-reduplication in the last larval and adult stages , reach-ing approximately 10 C Flemming et al. 2000 . To estimate the numbers of intestinal and hypodermal cells , we counted the numbers of DAPI-stained nuclei in the intestine or hypodermis in the worms fed on OP50 or HB101 foods . However , we did not find a significant difference between them Fig. 5A . Also , we counted the numbers of all the somatic nuclei detected between pharynx and anus as a mea-sure of all the cells including body wall muscle cells and neurons , and they did not differ significantly from each other Fig. 5A . These results suggest that the body size change caused by the difference in food is not attributed to a change in cell or nuclear num-ber and that the cell size is changing between the worms fed on OP50 or HB101 . It is known that the chromosomal ploidy or DNA content and the amount of proteins per cell are important for the cell size control Otto Whitton 2000 Jorgensen et al. 2002 . Although the best estimate of the chromosomal ploidy can be obtained with the DNA content of the nucleus , we instead determined the nuclear sizes sectional areas in the hypodermis , intestine and neurons as a measure of the chromosomal ploidy . The reasons are that nuclear sizes reflect their chromosomal ploidies as to these cells Hedgecock White 1985 Y. Nagamatsu and Y. Ohshima , unpublished data and that nuclear sizes looked more reliable than DNA contents which could be obtained with our equipments . The nuclear sizes show no significant difference between the worms fed on OP50 or HB101 food Fig. 5B , which may support the possibility that the increased body size of the worm fed on HB101 is not because of an increase in the chromosomal ploidy . However , we found that the protein content in the worms fed on HB101 was higher by 60 % than that in the worms fed on OP50 , indicating that the food-dependent body size change is closely related to the change in protein content in the worm Fig. 5C . Discussion Food-dependent body size change It is remarkable that the body size volume of the wild-type worm increases by approximately 65 % according to the change in food from E. coli strain OP50 to HB101 Fig. 1 . In animals , increase in body size is generally difficult in contrast to decrease , and this 65 % increase in body size is close to the body size increase of egl-4 mutants , which are the largest single mutants in C. elegans , from that of the wild type when grown on OP50 Hirose et al. 2003 . Because the ratios of the body length to average diameter of the worms are the same for both foods 1.6 mm ? 66 lm on OP50 1.9 mm ? 78 lm on HB101 24 , worms fed on HB101 should not be regarded to be fat but are larger with the same proportion . A fat worm in the usual sense carrying a normal body length has not been reported for C. elegans , whereas humans tend to become fat on a rich diet . We discuss here on the possible reasons for the food-dependent body size change . The difference in the nutrients such as protein , lipid and carbohydrate was reported among OP50 B strain , HB101 98 % derived from a K12 strain , DA837 derived from OP50 and HT115 K12 strain Brooks et al. 2009 . The carbohydrate levels and triacylglycerol TAG levels were clearly the major differences between K12 and B strains K12 contained a 3–5 times as high carbohydrate level and approximately a half as low TAG level as B. We think that the difference in the nutrients between HB101 and OP50 is the most plau-sible and major reason why the worms fed on HB101 grow much larger than those fed on OP50 . It is inter-esting that most worms fed on HB101 are known to enter quiescence , defined as complete cessation of both feeding and moving You et al. 2008 , and they show a reduced pumping rate compared with the worms fed on OP50 Soukas et al. 2009 . The quiescence was implicated to indicate satiety owing to nutrient-rich nature of HB101 You et al. 2008 . A second possible reason is likely to be the difference in the efficiency of absorption of nutrients between the two bacterial strains , which could be attributed to the difference in the nutritional components and possibly in the struc-ture between the two strains . We suggest that this possibility is supported by the significant decrease in the food-dependent body size change among the daf-2 mutants , as the daf-2 signaling probably controls nutri-tional absorption in the worm as suggested in the fly Britton et al. 2002 . Control of the food-dependent body size change by the insulin ? IGF-1 signal We found that the mutations in the daf-2 gene encoding the insulin ? IGF-1 receptor caused a reduc-tion in the ratio of the worm size fed on HB101 over that fed on OP50 in an allele-specific manner Table 1 . Particularly , the daf-2 m579 and daf-2 e1370 mutants showed only a small change in body size between OP50 food and HB101 food . The point mutations m579 and e1370 in the daf-2 gene were identified as R437C in the cysteine-rich ligand-bind-ing domain Scott et al. 2002 and P1465S in the kinase domain Kimura et al. 1997 , respectively . Our results together with their results suggest that these amino acids in the DAF-2 receptor play important roles in the food-dependent body size change . In addition , the metabolic rate of the daf-2 e1370 mutant is approximately 2–3 times as low as that of the wild type Van Voorhies Ward 1999 Dillin et al. 2002 . This fact suggests that the disruption of the food-dependent body size change in the daf-2 mutants is probably caused by abnormality in internal metabolic signals . In the fly , it is known that the nutrient availability stimulates the insulin signaling and the activated sig-naling stimulates the growth and proliferation of cells , which leads to alteration in the final body size Britton et al. 2002 Leevers Hafen 2004 . It is also known in C. elegans that the DAF-2 signaling is activated by chemosensory detection of food Gems Partridge 2001 and many daf-2 mutants show a dauer pheno-type of a variable degree , like the worms that undergo severe dietary restriction or a chemosensory defect Riddle Albert 1997 . Interestingly , the daf-2 e1370 and daf-2 m579 mutants show little dauer formation at 20 °C but exhibit the strongest defects in this food-dependent body size change . Therefore , the dauer formation and the body size change depending on food are not correlated with each other . We found that a null mutation in the daf-16 gene suppresses the defect in the food-dependent body size control of the daf-2 mutant , indicating that DAF-16 functions in this control downstream of DAF-2 . It is known that expressions of various genes possibly involved in the digestion or absorption of nutrients are positively or negatively regulated by the DAF-2 signal through the DAF-16 transcription factor Murphy et al. 2003 . These genes may have important roles in the food-dependent body size control . Additionally , mutants of the insulin ? IGF-1 path-way members in many animals are known to show a significant decrease in the body size , whereas daf-2 insulin ? IGF-1 receptor mutants in the worm were only slightly smaller than the wild type when grown on OP50 food . This result might suggest that the role of the insulin ? IGF-1 signal in the worm is different from that in other animals in terms of body size con-trol . However , the daf-2 mutants showed a significant decrease in the body size when grown on HB101 food , indicating that the DAF-2 insulin ? IGF-1 signal in the worm is also important for the body size con-trol as in other animals . Signaling pathways for the food-dependent body size control The ins-7 gene encodes one of the insulin-like ligands in C. elegans , and the mutant of the gene exhibits a partial defect in this food-dependent body size control Table 1 and Fig. 4A , B . It is known that INS-7 acts as a DAF-2 agonist , which is regulated by the DAF-2 signal as part of the positive feedback loop Murphy et al. 2003 . In contrast , INS-1 and INS-18 behave as DAF-2 antagonists Pierce et al. 2001 . Therefore , ins-1 and ins-18 mutations are expected to have an opposite effect to those by daf-2 and ins-7 mutations . However ins-1 and ins-18 mutations appear to have little effect on the food-dependent body size change Table 1 , suggesting that these genes function redun-dantly , either with each other or with other ins genes , or are not involved in this control . We showed here that the food-dependent body size change is mainly regulated by DAF-2 ? DAF-16 signaling probably through the AKT kinases Table 1 , Fig. 4A , B . Although SGK-1 kinase is required for the control of development , lifespan and stress response of the worm by phosphorylation of the DAF-16 transcription factor Hertweck et al. 2004 , the daf-16 mutation does not suppress the reduced body size of the sgk-1 mutant on OP50 food P 0.23 in t-test , which is in agreement with the results by Jones et al. 2009 . However , we found that the daf-16 mutation partially suppressed the reduced body size of the sgk-1 mutant on HB101 food P 0.001 in t-test Table 1 and Fig. 4A . As a result , the defect of the food-dependent body size change in the sgk-1 mutant is also partially suppressed by the daf-16 mutation Fig. 4B . Soukas et al. 2009 have compared the time required for the worm to grow from an egg to an adult in the wild type and the sgk-1 mutant . The wild-type worm fed on HB101 matured faster than that fed on OP50 , whereas interestingly sgk-1 mutant exhibited an oppo-site phenotype compared with that of the wild type . We confirmed that the growth rate of the sgk-1 mutant fed on OP50 is faster than that fed on HB101 Fig. 4C . As this phenotype of the sgk-1 mutant is not suppressed by the daf-16 mutation , it seems to be regulated in a DAF-16-independent manner results not shown . It is known that SGK-1 is also an impor-tant downstream effecter of TORC2 target of rapamycin complex 2 in mammals and C. elegans Reviewed in Hietakangas Cohen 2009 . The RICT-1 is one of the TORC2 components in C. ele-gans and the rict-1 mutant fed on OP50 grew faster than that fed on HB101 as the sgk-1 mutant did Soukas et al. 2009 . Importantly , the sectional body area of the rict-1 mutant fed on OP50 was larger than that fed on HB101 in adults Soukas et al. 2009 . There was no case in which the worm fed on OP50 grew larger than that fed on HB101 in our experi-ments . Thus , TORC2 including RICT-1 is expected to play an important role for SGK-1 to regulate the food-dependent body size change . Feeding is not related to the food-dependent body size control Feeding is also a potentially important factor in the food-dependent body size control . In the worm , there are several feeding-defective mutants that could mimic dietary restriction by altering their feeding behavior . The eat-2 gene encodes a ligand-gated ion channel subunit , and a mutation in this gene leads to regular but slow pumping Avery 1993 McKay et al. 2004 . The eat-5 gene encodes innexin that is required for synchronized pharyngeal muscle contraction . An eat-5 mutation uncouples the contraction of the corpus and the terminal bulb in the pharynx and therefore affects feeding Avery 1993 Starich et al. 1996 . Both mutants are significantly smaller than the wild type Table 1 , No. 21 and 22 , which can be attributed to a feeding defect . However , these mutants are on or close to the regression line in Fig. 3A No. 21 and 22 . Therefore , we do not think it likely that feeding is sig-nificantly related to the control of the food-dependent body size change . Mechanisms for the food-dependent body size control We showed here that the food-dependent body size change in the worm is explained by the change in the cell size rather than the cell number Fig. 5A , B . In C. elegans , the DBL-1 ? TGFb signaling pathway is known to be important for the body size control and the mutants of the components have a reduced body size compared with that of the wild type Estevez et al. 1993 Savage et al. 1996 Morita et al. 1999 . Flemming et al. 2000 and Lozano et al. 2006 reported that the mutants of the DBL-1 ? TGFb path-way members exhibited reduced endoreduplication in hypodermal cells compared with that of the wild type . Also , Tain et al. 2008 showed that the worm subjected to a dietary restriction exhibited a reduced body size with a reduced hypodermal ploidy com-pared with that of the worm grown on abundant food . However , the hypodermal polyploidization caused by the DBL-1 ? TGFb signaling is probably not associated with the food-dependent body size change between OP50 and HB101 food condition , because first the hypodermal nuclear sizes are almost the same between the two food conditions Fig. 5B and sec-ond the mutants of dbl-1 encoding the TGFb ligand and sma-6 encoding a SMAD transcription factor do not appear to be far off the regression line Fig. 3 , No. 17 and 18 . We found that the protein content of a worm fed on HB101 was by approximately 60 % greater than that of a worm fed on OP50 Fig. 5C . The protein syn-thesis is known to be an important factor for the body size control Conlon Raff 1999 . In Drosophila , the body size and cell size are controlled by insulin signal-ing , which regulates the protein biosynthesis in response to the nutritional condition . When the fly is subjected to fasting , insulin-like peptides are markedly reduced compared with those of a fed animal Ikeya et al. 2002 and the protein synthesis in a fasting animal is down-regulated via a FOXO transcription factor Teleman et al. 2008 . These results appear to explain well the control mechanisms for the food-dependent body size change by a change in the DAF-2 signal of the worm . Thus , we propose a major mechanism for the food-dependent body size control the worm fed on the nutrient-rich strain HB101 increases the rate of the protein synthesis through the DAF-2 signal and probably TOR signal mediated by SGK-1 , compared with that of the worm fed on OP50 , and then , the increased protein content affects the cell size , resulting in the larger body size of the worm fed on HB101 than that fed on OP50 . In conclusion , we have obtained here two major findings remarkable body size change depending on the food bacteria in C. elegans and the control of this body size by the insulin ? IGF-1 signal pathway . Also , we showed that the food-dependent body size change in the worm is explained by a change in the cell size rather than cell number , which is regulated by a change in protein synthesis in response to the differ-ence in food . Experimental procedures Strains and culture of C. elegans and E. coli C. elegans strains were handled essentially as described by Bren-ner 1974 and Sulston Hodgkin 1988 . A lawn of E. coli as a worm food source was made on a 6-cm NGM agar plate by spreading 100 lL of LB broth culture of an E. coli strain , in the region of approximately 3 cm diameter at the center , and the plate was used within a week . The worms were cultured at a density of 15–20 per plate at 20 °C . C. elegans strains used in this report are shown in Table 1 . The worm mutants of ins-7 , akt-2 , sgk-1 , aak-1 , drn-1 , C52B9.4 , col-167 , spp-1 and spp-12 are backcrossed three times to the wild type before measuring body size in this work . Bacterial strains used in this report are as follows OP50 derived from E. coli B , uracil-requiring , ZYA-argF U169 , f80lac Z D M15 , F , l , BL21 derived from BAD 567 , D rhaBAD 568 , rph-1 ] . Each strain was basically transformed by pGEM vector to make ampicillin 50 lg ? mL resistant to avoid contamination of other bacteria . Measurement of body size To synchronize worms , parent worms were allowed to lay eggs for 3–5 h and removed , and the remaining eggs were cultured to adults . Synchronized adult worms were transferred 2–3 times to remove their progeny until measurement . Worms were put in 100 mM NaN3 for 1 h , and the body volume , body length and diameters of a worm at 100 points along the body axis were measured using Zeiss Axiovert 35 microscope equipped with the automated device Senchu-Gazo-Keisoku-Souchi SVK-3A Showa Denki Co. Ltd as described by Hirose et al. 2003 . Bacteria were recovered from an NGM plate seeded with each bacterial strain and suspended in M9 buffer . The suspension was vigorously shaken for 30–60 s and placed on a slide glass . The pictures of the cells were taken using a Digital Sight DS-2MBWc CCD camera mounted on Nikon ECLIPSE 80i microscope with a 100 · ? 1.30 oil-immersion objective lens . The sectional area , major axis and minor axis were measured using the image-analyzing device Win ROOF Mitani corpo-ration . Measurements of nuclear numbers and sectional areas of nuclei Five-day-old adult worms 8 days after hatch fed on HB101 or OP50 were collected , washed three times in M9 buffer and fixed with Carnoy’s solution 60 % v ? v ethanol , 30 % chloro-form , 10 % acetic acid overnight at room temperature . The worms were washed by phosphate-buffered saline PBS con-taining 0.01 % Triton X-100 and stained with 2 lg ? mL DAPI at 4 °C overnight . Then , they were washed and suspended in PBS containing 0.01 % Triron X-100 , 1.1 mg ? mL 2-mercapt-ethylamine and 50 % glycerol . The number of all detectable nuclei between pharynx and anus in the upper side of a worm was counted in Nikon ECLIPSE 80i microscope . The num-bers of intestinal nuclei between pharynx and vulva and hypodermal nuclei between pharynx and anus were also counted separately . The images of intestinal , hypodermal and neuronal nuclei stained with DAPI as described previously were taken in using a Digital Sight DS-2MBWc CCD camera mounted on Nikon ECLIPSE 80i microscope with a 100 · ? 1.30 oil-immersion objective lens . The sectional area of each nucleus was analyzed by the image-analyzing device Win E. coli B , F , dcm , ompT , hsdS mB , gal ] and BW52113 B [ derived from E. coli K12 , rrnB , DlacZ4787 , HsdR514 , D ara - Measurements of protein contents To compare protein contents between the wild types fed on HB101 or OP50 , twenty 5-day-old adult animals 8 days after hatch were collected in 100 lL of lysis buffer containing 0.1 M NaOH and 0.2 % SDS . The tubes were incubated at 37 °C for 4 h . Protein concentration of a lysate was deter-mined using BCA protein assay kit Pierce .

Introduction Retinal ischemia , associated with glaucoma , diabetic retinop-athy , central retinal artery occlusion , and other vascular diseases , causes visual loss . Applying a brief ischemic stimulus after pro-longed retinal ischemia Post-conditioning , “post-C” provided significant neuroprotection , with improved post-ischemic func-tional recovery , decreased histological damage , and attenuation of apoptosis in rats Fernandez et al. , 2009 Dreixler et al. , 2010 . Further , it was shown that new protein synthesis was required for post-C Fernandez et al. , 2009 . These results with post-C are very exciting and directly clinically translatable to patients who have experienced retinal ischemia . Clinical studies of post-C are already underway , e.g. , for acute myocardial infarction Limalanathan et al. , 2010 . However , the neuroprotective effect of post-ischemic conditioning in the retina was effective only within 1 h after ischemia and required multiple applications of brief ischemia Fernandez et al. , 2009 . In a number of studies , post-C ameliorated neuronal injury in models of cerebral ischemia in rodents however , in all of these reports post-C was initiated within minutes to just a few hours after ischemia Zhao et al. , 2006 Wang et al. , 2008 Xing et al. , 2008 Pignataro et al. , 2009 . To date , only one study has demonstrated that a delayed post-C stimulus could alter the damage after ischemia in the CNS application of systemic hypoxia 5 days after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion in mice reduced thalamic atrophy Leconte et al. , 2009 . Considering the retina’s greater degree of tolerance to ischemia compared to brain Hayreh et al. , 1980 , we theorized that application of brief ischemia 24 h or later after ischemia ended could still provide neuro-protection in the retina . Delayed application of a brief , non-damaging ischemic stimulus to alter the outcome after ischemia is a novel concept which has considerable potential for clinical translation . 2 . Materials and methods 2.1 . Retinal ischemia and preconditioning Wistar rats 200e250 gm purchased from Harlan Indianapolis , IN were maintained on a 12 h on 12 h off light cycle . Procedures Roth et al. , 2006 Dreixler et al. , 2008 conformed to the ARVO Resolution on the Use of Animals in Research and were approved by our Animal Care Committee . For retinal ischemia , rats were anes-thetized with chloral hydrate , 275 mg kg i.p. , and intraocular pressure IOP increased to 130e135 mm Hg for 55 min using a pressurized bag of sterile ocular irrigating solution BSS Alcon , Fort Worth , TX connected to a 27-g needle positioned in the center of the anterior chamber . IOP was measured continuously using the needle and pressure tubing via a 3-way stopcock interposed into the line , with an electronic pressure transducer HewlettePackard zeroed to the level of the eye . IOP exceeded the systolic blood pressure , monitored non-invasively using a tail blood pressure cuff IITC Life Science Woodland Hills , CA . At 24 or 48 h after ischemia ended , post-C was produced by anesthetizing rats with ketamine 35 mg kg , and xylazine 5 mg kg , and placing a 2.0 silk suture behind the globe , which had been passed through a small length of plastic tubing PE-200 , Intramedic BectoneDickinson , Parsippany , NJ , and the suture was pulled to maximal tightness to occlude the retinal circulation for 5 min , as we previously described Roth et al. , 1998 . In control groups , the suture was placed but not tightened . Body temperature was maintained at 36e37 C by a servo-controlled heating blanket Harvard Apparatus , Natick , MA to prevent a protective effect on ischemia of hypothermia Faberowski et al. , 1989 . To preclude ischemic tolerance due to hypoxia Zhu et al. , 2007 , O2 saturation was measured with a pulse oximeter Ohmeda Louisville , CO on the rat’s tail . Supplemental oxygen was administered when necessary to maintain O2 saturation 94 % . 2.2 . Electroretinography before and after retinal ischemia Procedures were similar to those we reported previously Dreixler et al. , 2010 . Animals were dark-adapted for at least 2 h before recordings . For baseline and post-ischemic i.e. , after 7 days follow-up ERG recordings , rats were injected i.p. with ketamine 35 mg kg , and xylazine 5 mg kg . Corneal analgesia was with 1e2 drops of 0.5 % proparacaine Alcon . Pupils were dilated with 0.5 % tropicamide Alcon , and cyclomydril 0.2 % cyclopentolate HCl and 1 % phenylephrine HCl Alcon . The ERG was recorded at baseline prior to experiments and 7 days after Post-C using procedures modified from those we described previously Dreixler et al. , 2010 . Electrodes were placed on the cornea and sclera Weymouth and Vingrys , 2008 . These custom Ag AgCl electrodes were fashioned from 0.01000 Teflon-coated silver wire Grass Technologies , West Warwick , RI , with 5 mm of silver wire exposed and fashioned into a ‘U’ shape to act as the corneal positive electrode , while 10 mm of silver wire was exposed to form a loop , sclera negative electrode . Electrodes were then attached to a 9 V battery and placed in a 1 N HCl bath for 12 s until coated with AgCl . All electrodes were referenced to a 12 mm , 30 gauge stainless steel , needle electrode Grass inserted 2 3 down the length of the tail . Stimulus-intensity ERG analysis was achieved on a UTAS-E4000 electrodiagnostic system using a full-field Ganzfeld stimulator LKC Technologies , Gaithersburg , MD , with the rat’s head centered 7 inches from the stimulator . The low pass filter was 0.05 Hz and the high pass 500 Hz . Flash intensity varied electronically from 3.39 log cd s m2 to 1.89 log cd s m2 . Settings were confirmed by photometry EG G Model 550 photometer , Electro-Optics , Boulder , CO . Responses were averaged for 3e10 flashes delivered 4e60 s apart depending upon flash intensity , with number of flashes decreasing and time between them increasing with flash intensity . Flashes were progressively delivered from the lowest intensity to the highest to prevent possible effect upon dark adaptation , and at least 1 min elapsed between the series of flashes for the three highest intensity settings . Recorded time , intensity , and amplitude were exported and analyzed in Matlab The MathWorks , Natick , MA as we described previously Dreixler et al. , in press-a . Recordings were first base-line corrected for drift or low frequency noise . For intensity-response ERGs , peak a-wave amplitude was calculated as the Table 1 Number of retinal ganglion cells per region of interest mean s.e.m. in the ischemic retinae 7 days after 24 h Sham Post-C compared to the number of retinal ganglion cells in the ischemic retinae for 24 h Post-C . negative minimum following the light stimulus , and the b-wave amplitude as difference between the a-wave and the maximum b-wave value recorded thereafter . The Hood and Birch photo-transduction model , P3 ? i t ? ? e i $ S ? t t ? 2 eff ? was fit to the leading edge of the a-wave . The derived P3 was then subtracted from the baseline corrected ERG waveform . Oscillatory potentials OPs were measured by extracting OP wavelet components using Fast Fourier transformation . The sum of the root mean squares Sum RMS of the amplitudes of the OP wavelets was calculated Bui et al. , 2005 . OPs were then subtracted from the remaining waveform leaving the scotopic P2 for the rod bipolar response . 2.3 . Histology Eyes enucleated on the seventh day after post-conditioning were immediately placed in Davidson’s fixative 11 % glacial acetic acid , 2 % neutral buffered formalin and 32 % ethanol in H2O for 24 h , then transferred to 70 % ethanol for 24 h and stored in PBS at 4 C. Eyes were embedded in paraffin , sectioned to 4 mm and stained with hematoxylin and eosin H E . Sections were examined by light microscopy and cell counts in the retinal ganglion cell RGC layer were quantified using 40 optics . Specifically , the number of putative retinal ganglion cells in the RGC layer was counted in a standardized region in all of the retinae called a “region of interest” , centered 1280 mm distant as measured by an eyepiece reticule from the thinning of the neurofilaments arising from the optic nerve head and comprising the neuronal fiber layer . The counts were made , in both directions from the optic nerve head , in this same region spanning 128 mm . The averaged number of cells in the RGC layer is reported as cells per region of interest . 2.4 . Data handling and statistical analysis ERG data were corrected for daily variation in the normal eye and for simultaneous reference to the baseline in the ischemic eye , as previously described Roth et al. , 2006 Dreixler et al. , 2008 , 2009a , 2009b . The a-and b-waves , SUM RMS of the OPs , and P2 from ischemic eyes 7 days after post-conditioning in the groups for comparison were expressed as stimulus-intensity plots intensity , log cd s m2 on the x-axis , and % recovery of baseline on the y-axis Dreixler et al. , 2008 , in press-a . The data were normally distrib-uted as confirmed using normality plots and skewness kurtosis in Stata version 10.0 College Station , TX . For histopathological data analysis , we used the ManneWhitney non-parametric test . 3 . Results Post-C administered 24 h after ischemia n ? 15 significantly increased the b-wave , OP RMS and P2 recovery at 7 days following the delayed ischemia and post-C , when compared to the sham post-C and 24 h ischemia control group n ? 11 over a range of flash intensities from 1.02 to 1.4 log cd s m2 Fig. 1 . Fig. 2 shows that the averaged ERG stimulus-intensity plots , for a-wave , b-wave , OP RMS and P2 , were consistent with the results of the normalized results . The time latency for the b-wave significantly increased from 75.9 3.6 ms at baseline to 111.8 13.5 ms p ? 0.03 at day 7 at the 0.87 log cd s m2 flash intensity in the 24 h sham post-C group . At the same flash intensity the b-wave latency was unchanged in the 24 h post-C group data not shown . Represen-tative ERG traces are shown in Fig. 3A . Histological examination of the retinae 7 days after ischemia ? 24 h later post-C or 24 h later sham post-C showed that the number of Table 2 Number of retinal ganglion cells per region of interest mean s.e.m. in the ischemic retinae 7 days after 48 h Sham Post-C compared to the number of retinal ganglion cells in the ischemic retinae for 48 h Post-C . cells in the RGC layer in the ischemic retinae significantly increased to 8.8 0.8 cells region of interest n ? 9 in the 24 h post-C group from 6.5 0.7 n ? 6 intheischemicretinaeforthe24hshampost-Cgroup p ? 0.02 , indicating the preservation of histological structure of the retina after ischemia by post-C Table 1 Fig. 4 . Qualitatively , inflammatory cell infiltration decreased in the 24 h post-C group compared to that of ischemia and sham post-C Fig. 4 . The normal retinae RGC layer counts were 11.2 0.5 for the ischemia ? 24 h later post-C group and 11.3 0.5 for the ischemia ? 24 h later sham post-C group Table 2 . Lengthening the time between ischemia and post-C time resulted in loss of the protection afforded by delayed post-C . Post-C administered 48 h after ischemia n ? 4 did not change the a-wave , b-wave , OP RMS and P2 recovery at 7 days after the delayed post-C , when compared to the sham 48 h post-C control group n ? 4 over a range of flash intensities from 1.02 to 1.4 log cd s m2 Fig. 5 . Fig. 6 shows that the averaged ERG stimulus-intensity plots , for a-wave , b-wave , OP RMS and P2 , were consistent with the results of the normalized results . The time latency for the b-wave was unchanged from baseline to day 7 for the 48 h post-C and 48 h sham post-C groups data not shown . Representative ERG traces are shown in Fig. 3B . Examination of the retinae 7 days after ischemia ? 48 h post-C or 48 h sham post-C showed that the number of cells in the RGC layer in the ischemic retinae did not change . The number of cells in the RGC layer in the ischemic retinae was 6.5 0.8 n ? 4 in the 48 h post-C group and 5.8 0.5 n ? 4 for the 48 h sham post-C group p ? 0.47 Table 1 Fig. 4 . Compared to the sham post-C group , 48 h post-C did not alter inflammatory cell infiltration after ischemia Fig. 4 . The normal retinae RGC layer counts were 11.1 0.5 for the ischemia ? 48 h later post-C group and 10.8 1.0 for the ischemia ? 48 h later sham post-C group . 4 . Discussion Our results confirmed the hypothesis that delayed post-conditioning could ameliorate the damage after retinal ischemia . As a novel strategy that could potentially protect against retinal ischemia , post-C shifts the focus of neuroprotection away from the paradigm of pre-ischemic intervention to manipulations that alter the post-ischemic state in a manner that is favorable to survival of retinal cells . In the present study we demonstrated the new finding that delayed application of a brief ischemic stimulus afforded significant neuroprotection after retinal ischemia . However , the time window of effectiveness of post-C was limited to 24 h , because no significant effect of post-conditioning was demonstrated at 48 h after ischemia . In this study , the most apparent effect of delayed post-conditioning 24 h after ischemia was found in the inner retina , as reflected by dramatically improved recovery of the b-wave , P2 , and oscillatory potentials , and decreased loss of cells in the retinal ganglion cell layer and diminished infiltration of inflammatory cells , while recovery of the a-wave showed a non-significant trend for improvement with delayed post-C . The reason for the relative enhancement of inner retinal function may be due to the nature of the ischemia produced in this model . There is relative sparing of the outer retina , perhaps due to residual blood supply from the photoreceptor cells Hughes , 1991 . Despite the improved outcome after ischemia with 24 h delayed post-C , post-C 48 h later only produced a non-significant trend for improvement of the oscilla-tory potentials . This suggests there is a limited time window for effectiveness of post-C . Our findings of the effectiveness of post-C as late as 24 h after ischemia are unique compared to earlier studies of post-conditioning in the central nervous system . With respect to cere-bral ischemia , nearly all studies have examined post-C using a brief ischemic stimulus in only the first minutes after the onset of reperfusion , where it was effective in reducing infarct size and disturbed behavioral or motor function in rats Gao et al. , 2008 Pignataro et al. , 2008 Jiang et al. , 2009 . In one study Ren et al. , 2008 delayed post-conditioning 6 h after cerebral ischemia in a mouse model reduced infarct size . The latest time window for post-conditioning shown to date was where hypoxic post-conditioning , a different type of stimulus than brief ischemia , 5 days after focal cerebral ischemia in mice reduced thalamic atrophy , but it did not alleviate ischemia-induced functional defi-cits Leconte et al. , 2009 . Yet in our study , ischemic post-C 24 h after ischemia significantly improved both retinal function and decreased cellular loss , thereby demonstrating an even more profound neuroprotective effect . In a previous study , retinal post-C was found to reduce ischemia-induced apoptosis Dreixler et al. , 2010 , and post-C was found to require new protein synthesis Fernandez et al. , 2009 Dreixler et al. , 2010 . Recently , we reported that post-C requires mitogen-activated protein kinase p38a and protein kinase B , or Akt Dreixler et al. , in press-b . Apart from these findings , further investigation is required to understand the mechanisms of post-C in the retina . Our results differ from those of others . Previously , it was reported that post-C at 24 h after retinal ischemia in rats was ineffective in altering outcome Fernandez et al. , 2009 . A poten-tially important difference in the studies is that we used a total occlusion of the central retinal artery with a suture placed behind the globe as the post-C stimulus . When intraocular pressure is elevated to produce ischemia , some residual blood flow remains in the retinal or choroidal circulation Roth and Pietrzyk , 1994 Lin and Roth , 1999 . It is possible that the depth of the ischemic stimulus for post-C is related to its effectiveness , similar to our demonstration that post-C is more effective following prolonged compared to shorter periods of damaging ischemia Dreixler et al. , 2010 . In any event , our study demonstrates the feasibility of a brief post-conditioning ischemic stimulus to ameliorate damage as late as 24 h after ischemic insult . This stimulus could possibly be applied to patients who have sustained central retinal vascular occlusion or similar events where the outcome is often poor Chen and Lee , 2008 , and may be an effective supplement or substitute to treat-ment attempts such as thrombolysis .

Introduction In the human eye , melanosomes of melanocytes and the retinal pigment epithelium RPE facilitate many functions which are essential for the antioxidative defense of the tissue Sarna , 1992 . These are e.g. the absorption of light and presumably also the storage of toxic waste , as shown by the ability to bind heavy metals like Pb , Cu , La , Gd in sepia melanin Hong and Simon , 2007 , Fe in neuromelanin Jellinger et al. , 1992 Zecca et al. , 2008 , and for ocular melanosomes the storage of Hg and Se Ulshafer et al. , 1990 and drugs like cisplatin Chen et al. , 2006 . Melanosomes bind also functional metals involved in cell metabolism , for RPE e.g . Ca , Cu and Zn Samuelson et al. , 1993 Sarna , 1992 Bush and Simon , 2007 . It is proposed that the binding properties of the melanin inside the melanosomes can be changed through oxidative processes , such as those known to be present in age related macular degeneration AMD patients , but also in the normal ageing process . This can lead to a redistribution of the cations bound to melanin and to the induction of pathologic processes . These alter-ations may be related or even induce the prooxidant capacity of melanosomes with age Rozanowski et al. , 2008 . Together with the age pigments lipofuscin and melanolipofuscin aged RPE melano-somes amplify ocular photo toxicity Boulton et al. , 2004 . This implies that age pigments and aged melanosomes are related to the onset of AMD . However , research on these topics is still ongoing and results gathered yet are more presumptive than fact . 1.1 . Composition and function of melanosomes Quantitative analytical electron microscopy AEM , including all elements down to boron was applied beforehand to understand the chemical composition of melanosomes of the choroid and RPE of rats , monkey and human donors . They were found to contain defined mole fractions of C , N , O as main elements 5 at % , Ca , S , Cl 0.1 at % and the trace elements Cu and Zn 0.1e0.3 at % Eibl et al. , 2006 Biesemeier et al. , 2011 . In addition , the melanin type eu-and pheomelanin content of the melanosome was investi-gated for rats using the S N ratio method , originally established for degradation analysis Jimbow et al. , 1984 Ito and Fujita , 1985 . Elements are chemically bound to the melanin and artifacts due to fixation and epon-embedding are minimal Samuelson et al. , 1993 . In contrast , most soluble ions should be washed out in the cyto-plasm , which now reflects the composition of the embedding medium Eibl et al. , 2006 Biesemeier et al. , 2011 . For melanosomes of the RPE and choroid , it was shown that AEM , here combined Energy Dispersive X-ray microanalysis EDX and Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy EELS yield the following points i especially high absolute oxygen and nitrogen mole fractions , ii Ca-O correlation , iii melanin type , iv comparison between choroid and RPE , v Zn analysis . 1.2 . Composition of lipofuscin With age , the age pigment lipofuscin accumulates as residual bodies inside lysosomes of the human RPE Roberts , 2002 , coex-isting with the melanosomes . Age pigments are also found in the brain and other post mitotic tissues of aged persons Yin , 1996 . Despite intensive research , the composition of lipofuscin is still not understood Ng et al. , 2008 . RPE lipofuscin is proposed to contain highly modified , undegradable remnants of phagocytosed photore-ceptor outer segments OS Eldred et al. , 1982 Feeney-Burns and Eldred , 1983 Feeney-Burns et al. , 1988 Eldred and Katz , 1989 Warburtonetal. , 2005 , e.g . retinoidsandcarotenoids.The formation of lipofuscin-like material in the RPE can be accelerated by protease 1.3 . Formation of melanolipofuscin in the RPE From the fourth decade on , additional melanolipofuscin gran-ules become visible in the RPE Feeney-Burns et al. , 1984 . Morphologically , they have an electron-dark melanin core and an electron-opaque bright lipofuscin shell , but it is unknown how these granules form . It was investigated that peroxidised degra-dation end products , e.g. from phagocytosed photoreceptor outer segments , become integrated into the melanosomal membrane Schraermeyer and Stieve , 1994 where they are presumed to develop into lipofuscin thereafter . In elderly persons , the amount of melanosomes decreases and melanolipofuscin and lipofuscin granules become predominant . Here , we investigate the chemical composition of aged pigments of human donors 1 to distinguish melanosomes from lipofuscin granules , 2 to analyze whether melanolipofuscin is composed of a melanosome core and a lipofuscin shell . Since we found signifi-cant differences between the two donors , we will investigate theses differences in a higher set of samples according to age , disease , race and environment in future studies . The present study will build the basis for these investigations . 2 . Material and methods Sample preparation and combined quantitative EDX and EELS analysis on an energy-filtered TEM were performed as described elsewhere Eibl et al. , 2006 Biesemeier et al. , 2011 . 2.1 . Sample preparation In short , the eyes of two female human organ donors age 65 years P1 , 85 years P2 were used according to the statements of the ethics-representative of the Clinical Anatomy , Tuebingen . The eyes were opened with a circular slit at the limbus and fixed over Table 1 Lipofuscin composition in the literature . night at 4 C in 4 % glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer pH 7.4 . The iris and vitreous were removed . Small pieces 1.5 mm3 of central parts of the eye bulbs near the macula containing sclera , choroid , RPE were prepared , washed three times in 0.1 M caco-dylate buffer and dehydrated in a graded series of ethanol and embedded in Epon . Ultrathin 70 nm and semithin 114 nm sections of the RPE e choroid complex were mounted on uncoated alumina grids . All TEM reagents were purchased from Plano Wetzlar . 2.2 . Autofluorescence of lipofuscin 70 nm thick sections of epon-embedded retinal material , as they were also used for EDX analysis , were additionally placed on glass slides and investigated in the fluorescence microscope with a special lipofuscin filter Analysentechnik Feuerbacher , Tuebingen , excitation 370 nm emission 575 nm . 2.3 . Electron microscopy Imaging , EDX and EELS measurements of pigment granules melanosomes , lipofuscin and melanolipofuscin granules were performed on a Zeiss 912 Omega microscope equipped with an omega energy filter , a 2k*2k CCD camera and an Oxford EDX detector at a magnification of 12,500 . The emission current was set 5e7 mA for EDX and 2e3 mA for EELS . The spot size was set to 100 nm to gain enough signal for EDX and core loss EEL spectra . 2.3.1 . Energy-filtered images Energy-filtered bright-field images were acquired using the Esivision software Esivision , 2002 . In addition , for each area of interest energy-filtered images were acquired with 23 eV and 46 eV energy-losses using a 5 eV energy slit to probe the local mass thickness . Ratios of these images were then calculated and are referred to as 46 23 eV images . The 46 23 eV images were used to select high density melanosomes , which were then analyzed by spectroscopy . The images were acquired at 0.4 mrad , 4 mA , using the 3.5 mrad objective aperture at a magnification of 2890 . 2.3.2 . EDX spectroscopy For EDX spectroscopy , the objective aperture was completely removed and a special stray aperture was used sitting above the sample to shield trace x-rays and electrons hitting the sample . The sample on top of the grid was always facing the EDX detector to keep the Al stray radiation to a minimum . The EDX detector is equipped with an ultrathin window and a digital pulse processor was used for the analyses . Spectra were quantitatively analyzed by the INCA software INCA , 2001 , using the standardless Cliff-Lorimer k-factor method . The k-factors were those used in Eibl et al. , 2006 . For high accuracy , we only used spectra with minimum net counts for O being 15,000 . Therefore , minimum detectable mole fractions MDMF for trace elements like Cu and Zn were less than 0.025 at % , and for Ca 0.031 at % , respectively . The calculations of the MDMF were performed as described in Biesemeier et al. 2011 . In our analysis , we used mole fractions at % , which can be easily translated into weight fractions wt % by the following formula , as outlined in Williams and Carter 1996 . The ratio of the concentrations of the weight fractions cwt of two elements is equal to the ratio of their mole fractions cat multiplied with the ratios of their atomic weight M . 2.3.3 . EELS Acquisition and data analysis of EEL spectra were performed using the Esivision software Esivision , 2002 . The objective aper-ture was inserted for low loss EELS 3.5 mrad and for core loss EELS 8.16 mrad . The spectrometer entrance aperture 100 mm was used for both low loss and core loss EELS . Low loss EELS spectra yielded the sample thickness in units of the electron mean free path , since the electron mean free path is different for the different pigments but the thickness of the section is constant . Therefore , low loss EEL spectra were acquired from the cytoplasm and the different pigment granule types . The section thickness of each area was calculated from the low loss spectra as described by Egerton , 1996 . The calculated values were then used to obtain the ratio of the thickness of the cytoplasm and the different pigment granules . This gives a value for the density of the different organelles . Core loss EEL spectra of the C-K and N-K ionization edges were quantified by integrating the net counts of the ionization edges window 30 eV and using calculated ionization cross sections , to determine mole fraction ratios of C N. For 120 keV primary energy and an acceptance angle of 8.16 mrad integrated ionization cross-sections were calculated for NeK 9.35 10 22 cm2 and for CeK 2.02 21 cm2 . The cN cC mole fraction ratio as determined by EELS was then used to recalculate all mole fractions determined by EDX by dividing them by 1 ? cC cN cC , i.e. by 1 ? ab , a being the carbon mole fraction determined by EDX and b being cN cC determined by the EELS quantitative analysis . The EELS spectra at the NeK ionization edge had about 1500 counts yielding a MDMF of N of 0.4 at % . No corrections were applied to the individual spectra , e.g . no absorption correction for EDX and no spectrum deconvolution for EEL spectra for accounting for multiple inelastic scatterings , for details see Biesemeier et al. , 2011 . 3 . Results 3.1 . Imaging Lipofuscin autofluorescence was detected using a special lip-ofuscin filter and yielded the typical golden-yellow auto-fluorescence of lipofuscin granules and also the bright shell of melanolipofuscin granules was auto fluorescent Fig. 1 . Fig. 2 shows TEM images of one area of the RPE of person 2 , which were taken at different electron energy losses . The TEM bright field image 0 eV , Fig. 2a shows the characteristic black melanosomes M , and brighter lipofuscin L and melanolipofuscin granules ML built by an electron dark core and a bright shell . Images obtained at higher energy losses show areas with higher molecule density and electron scattering ability as highlighted spots , whereas areas of lower density have less contrast and appear darker . Fig. 2b and c shows the ratio of the 46 eV energy loss and the 23 eV energy loss images as a black and white image and as a false colour image , respectively . They provide better contrast than bright field images at 0 eV energy loss and demonstrate that melanosomes and dark parts of melanolipofuscin granules are organelles of high density electron scattering strength blue , whereas lipofuscin granules and brighter parts of melanolipofuscin granules have less density green to red . Fig. 2d shows typical granules and the position of the electron spot as used for analysis . Fig. 2e illustrates the changes found in mass density at the border of melanosomes , when they overlap with low density cytoplasm . This results in a green frame at the border of the melanosomes in Fig. 2c . Note , lipofuscin and bright melanolipofuscin fractions are even less electron dense than the border regions of melanosomes , shown in false colour by red sparkling in the green regions resembling these granules . Therefore , we only analyzed 100 nm spots of the central areas of the melanosomes to avoid artefacts . Together with low loss EELS , suitable areas for analysis can now be selected . 3.2 . Spectroscopy EDX and EELS measurements were obtained from each six pigment granules , i.e. lipofuscin granules , bright fractions and dark fractions of the same melanolipofuscin granules and melanosomes of P1 and P2 . Characteristic spectra of melanosomes and lipofuscin granules are presented in Fig. 3a for EDX , 3bec for core loss EELS and 3dee for low loss EELS . Correlations of oxygen with either C , Ca or P yield possible bonding with oxygen . Low loss EELS spectra were acquired from the different pigment granule types and the cytoplasm . From these spectra first the section thickness can be extracted and from that the mass density of the different pigment types using the electron mean free path . The density of the different pigment granules was calculated by dividing the section thickness of the cytoplasm with the thickness of neighboring pigment granules . Melanosomes showed a ratio of 0.78 0.24 . Lipofuscin yielded a ratio of 0.99 0.11 and bright and dark areas of melanolipofuscin had intermediate mole fractions of about 0.91 and 0.85 , respectively . Together with the energy-filtered images this calculation demonstrates that melanosomes and dark areas of melanolipofuscin are high density organelles , while lip-ofuscin is of a density close to the cytoplasm . Table 2 shows the net counts of the EDX spectra of Fig. 3a , and Table 3 gives the calculated mole fractions of the EDX spectra of Fig. 3a . The mean mole fractions of the different pigment types are presented in Table 4 . Fig. 4 shows correlation diagrams of oxygen with C , O and P. The figure shows the data of all pigment granule types of both persons together , since we want to point out the overall correlations of oxygen with the elements . The correlations are not specific to certain pigment types M , L , ML or donors but reflect the chemical binding of the pigments with metal ions . The arrows point out the person specific differences in the elemental composition in P1 and P2 without changing the correlations . 3.2.1 . Melanosomes Melanosomes of the RPE and choroid of both donors contained larger mole fractions for the main elements O about 5 at % and N about 10 at % than lipofuscin granules about 4 at % O , maximum 1.6 at % N and the cytoplasm about 3 at % O and 0.8 at % N . Both melanosomes of the RPE and choroid of person 1 showed the elemental composition with C , N and O as main elements 5 at % , S , Ca , Cl 0.1 at % and the trace elements Cu and Zn 0.06e0.2 at % , as reported earlier for human Eibl et al. , 2006 and rat melanosomes of the RPE and choroid Biesemeier et al. , 2011 . Comparing melanosomes of choroid and RPE , higher mole fractions of O , Cu and Zn were found for RPE melanosomes . Melanosomes of P2 yielded lower oxygen , calcium and zinc mole fractions than those of P1 . Accordingly , the mean values and correlation diagrams are shifted . However , the pigments in both persons showed an overall negative CeO correlation 2 1 and a positive CaeO correlation of 0.02 1 , also for single measurements Fig. 4c . Note , that the melanosomes have high sulfur mole frac-tions , with an S N ratio of about 0.15 to 0.29 Table 4 , proposing a high pheomelanin content . 3.2.2 . Lipofuscin granules Lipofuscin granules were of a different chemical composition compared to the melanosomes . They had lower Ca , Cu and Zn mole fractions , but significant P mole fractions about 0.2 at % . They also contained less nitrogen 0e1.7 at % and oxygen 3.6e4.8 at % than the melanosomes . For lipofuscin , a positive PeO correlation of 0.3 Fig. 4d was observed , which suggests a 1 3 binding of P to O . This value is close to the real PO4 binding of phosphate groups in lipids and other structures . 3.2.3 . Melanolipofuscin granules The melanolipofuscin granules were investigated by measuring the bright and dark areas separately . While the dark areas were close to the composition of melanosomes , bright areas resembled the composition of lipofuscin but with a significantly increased N mole fraction of about 3 at % . 4 . Discussion 4.1 . Correlating optical , ultrastructural and chemical properties of retinal pigment granules RPE lipofuscin is identified either by its optical properties or by the size and contrast of fixed granules by TEM imaging . The typical RPE lipofuscin autofluorescence at 390e490 nm excitation and 515 nm emission was found using microfluorometric and spectrometric methods Katz et al. , 1984 . The maximum of this fluorescence shifts when observed with either microfluorometric yellow-golden and spectrometric methods blue and can be affected by the preparation , e.g. by fixation with aldehydes and concentration dependent fluorescence shifts in spectrometric analyses reviewed by Yin , 1996 . A shift from blue to golden-yellow and even to orangeered emission 400e600 nm starts with increasing concentrations of Schiff bases , e.g . A2E , and other age pigment fluorophores . This concentration-dependent shift does not occur in microfluorometric analyses Yin and Brunk , 1991 . Some additional background fluorescence may occur after fixation of the tissue with aldehyde fixatives Yin , 1996 , but using micro-fluorometry , single lipofuscin granules may still be recognized using a 630 times magnification . Differences in spectral properties can also be explained by a different distribution of fluorophores Haralampus-Grynaviski et al. , 2001 . Since lipofuscin is insoluble in ethanol and water , we also found the typical fluorescence of lipofuscin in our epon embedded sections . Therefore , we conclude that glutaraldehyde fixation , ethanol dehydration and epon embedding for TEM preparation did not alter the composition and optical properties of lipofuscin . At least 30 % of lipofuscin is soluble in methanol chloroform thereby extracting the lipid phase , which contains the predominant lipofuscin fluorophores Bazan et al. , 1990 . This is the reason for the above mentioned lack of artifacts . The protein fraction of lipofuscin may be extracted using SDS and proteomics may be performed using standard procedures Warburton et al. , 2005 . Both biochemical techniques support the generation of lipofuscin from photoreceptor outer segments , but also from additional autophagocytosis of RPE material like mitochondria . For EDX analysis , the mole fractions of the elements were calculated using the Cliff Lorimer equation with calibrated stan-dardless k-factors see also Eibl et al. , 2006 . For high accuracy , only spectra , in which carbon net counts exceeded 100,000 integrated counts and oxygen net counts exceeded 15,000 integrated counts were used as shown in Table 2 . This resulted in the statistical errors listed in Table 5 . The scatter of mole fractions was larger than the error due to the counting statistics . Therefore , standard deviations of the mean mole fractions measured were mainly due to differences in the different pigment granules here melanosomes , lipofuscin and not due to counting statistics . Thus , a direct comparison of single measure-ments with mean values of other measurements from the same species or tissue was meaningful and the number of granules investigated was adequate . Table 2 Netcounts under peak of EDX spectra of Fig. 3 . Netttocounts C O The results gathered from EDX analysis were more accurate than EELS analyses . Specimen thickness had no effect on EDX measurements in the range of 70e200 nm but highly affected multiple scattering effects in EEL spectra for details see Biesemeier et al. , 2011 . These scattering effects increased the MDMF of N in EEL spectra . However , the MDMF of N was lower than the measured mole fractions of N in the lipofuscin granules of P2 , and therefore , we propose that the low nitrogen mole fractions found for lip-ofuscin in this work are still meaningful within the limitations given from specimen thickness . Since N is a main component of Table 3 Quantitative analysis at % of EDX spectra of Fig. 3 . c at % C O Al proteins our data indicate a minor amount of proteins in the lip-ofuscin granules . This is in accordance with Ng et al. 2008 , who also showed a protein fraction of less than 3 wt % in purified lip-ofuscin granules . 4.2 . Understanding elemental composition The elemental composition of biological tissue can be carried out fairly accurately as has been shown in this and other papers . The interpretation of the obtained mole fraction or mass fraction ratios is however poorly understood in the scientific community . We determined the elemental composition of RPE pigments in this study . Pigments consist of molecular biochemical compounds , i.e. proteins , lipids etc. , these molecular biochemical compounds consist of atoms or elements . The elemental analysis allows assigning certain classes of molecules to the pigments . This assignment requires high precision and optimum minimum detectable mole or mass fractions and is based on the knowledge of what elements certain molecules consist of . Correlation diagrams of oxygen with other elements indicate their molecular bonding and the S N ratio of melanosomes determines the melanin type . Interestingly , the same negative CeO correlations and positive CaeO correlations were found for melanosomes in different species but also within different pigment granule types , as shown for this work in Fig. 4 . One might assume that this assignment is very imprecise , however , one should keep in mind that the number of different elements with sufficiently high mole fractions contained in e.g . melanosomes is about 10 and the precision of the mole fraction ratios is amazingly high . Elemental analysis thus yields a bar code for the individual pigments with a lateral resolution of less than 100 nm and this information is much more than the contrast of e.g . TEM bright-field images which up to now was the only way to distinguish the pigments in the TEM . As an example , N is found with fairly high mole fraction in melanosomes . This allows assigning proteins as being contained in melanosomes and lack of proteins in lipofuscin , which did not contain significant N mole fractions in our samples . The biological function of the pigments is established to a very large extent by the molecular composition , which the elemental analysis allows to trace . A direct relation between elemental composition and biological function is not intended and would not be a correct interpretation of the scope of Table 4 our analysis . The advantage of the analytical electron microscopy is that the ultrastructure analysis and chemical analysis with excel-lent lateral resolution can be carried out on one sample area . The disadvantage is that no direct molecular information can be obtained . Therefore , correlative microscopy of analytical electron microscopy with e.g . Time Of Flight Secondary Ion Mass Spectros-copy TOF-SIMS will yield great possibilities in future . 4.3 . Understanding the composition of ocular pigments 4.3.1 . Melanosomes In earlier publications , melanosomes were described to be membrane-bound organelles composed of melanin , protein and lipids , with 15 wt % proteins in melanosomes of bovine choroid Liu et al. , 2005 . Melanosome-specific proteins were identified to be melanogenic or specific for lysosome-related organelles Chi et al. , 2006 . The melanin type was analyzed by means of the S N ratio , giving higher values for pheomelanin 0.48 and lower values for eumelanic pigments 0.005 Jimbow et al. , 1984 Ito and Fujita , 1985 . The melanosomes analyzed in this study were composed of mixed eu-and pheomelanin with a high pheomelanin fraction determined by means of the S N ratio , as shown in Table 4 . The pheomelanin fraction is proposed to be both specific for donor and tissue since P1 showed higher S N ratios compared to P2 and melanosomes of the choroid had higher values compared to those of the RPE . To our knowledge , this is the first investigation analyzing the melanin type of single human choroidal and RPE melanosomes without prior isolation of the granules from the tissue . Nevertheless , the data are in accordance with other analyses on human ocular melanosomes which identified them as mixed type melanosomes based on either ESR spectroscopy Sealy et al. , 1982 or according to degradation analysis on choroidal and ciliary melanosomes Novellino et al. , 1981 . However , the amounts of eu-and pheomelanins in melanosomes seem to be very heterogeneous and vary according to tissue , species and between different individuals as analyzed by Prota et al. on differently col-oured irides Prota et al. , 1998 . Current understanding of the melanin types of vertebrate melanosomes of different tissues is reviewed in Simon and Peles 2010 . The lipid fraction of melanosomes has also been studied before Ward and Simon , 2007 Choroidal melanosomes contain mostly sphingomyelins 20 % , glycerophosphoglycerol arachidonic acid and glycerophosphoinositol as surface acting phospholipids , regu-lating protein binding . On the other hand , additional sphingo-myelins and cholesterol elude the possibility of lipid rafts . In contrast , melanosomes of the RPE contain mostly phospholipids , e.g . glycerophosphoethanolamins with polyunsaturated fatty acids , responsible for folding of proteins , activation of phospholipases and as protector against reactive oxygen species and in addition glyc-erophosphoserin and glycerophosphate Ward and Simon , 2007 . Since melanosomes showed no measurable P mole fractions as an indicator of phospholipids in this study , we suppose that the lipid fraction is only at the outer surface of the melanosomes and therefore not significantly included in our measurements of their matrix . The main elemental composition of the melanosomes analyzed here is in accordance to the literature . Differences in the distribu-tion of certain elements are both related to different techniques used and can also be specific for species , tissue and different indi-viduals . Compared to P1 , the melanosomes of P2 contained smaller oxygen mole fractions and therefore smaller mole fractions of associated Ca and trace elements . This clearly points out that pigment granules from different donors show a donor dependent heterogeneity . The granule to granule differences are small for the different granule types as can be estimated by the standard devi-ations in Figs. 5 and 6 and the errors listed in Table 5 . Whether the differences in the elemental composition of the two donors are age-dependent or not can not be answered . Further material will be needed to investigate the age-and disease related changes in RPE pigment composition . Since we did not find quantitative analyses concerning Ca and Zn in human RPE melanosomes in the literature , we compare our data with our previous studies on rat melanosomes of the choroid and the RPE Eibl et al. , 2006 . Melanosomes of rats and monkeys had larger O and Ca mole fractions compared to the melanosomes of humans in this study . However , zinc mole fractions analyzed here for human RPE about 0.2 at % for P1 were twice as high as zinc mole fractions analyzed for other species before about 0.1 at % Table 5 Relative scatter of measured data SD mean value and errors of the counting statistics for the quantification of melanosomes and lipofuscin from Fig. 3 . Melanosome P1 Lipofuscin P1 for choroid , 0.07 at % for RPE in rats Biesemeier et al. , 2011 and were even larger than the Ca mole fraction . Ca is important for the metabolism of the retina and like in pigment cells of the ear Meyer zum Gottesberge , 1988 also melanosomes of the RPE are consid-ered to be a Ca storage Hess , 1975 Panessa and Zadunaisky , 1981 Salceda and Riesgo-Escovar , 1990 . Possibly , the Ca concentration of the photoreceptors gets replenished from melanosomal stores Salceda and Riesgo-Escovar , 1990 . Zinc is known to be involved in the maintenance and anti-oxidative defense of the RPE , e.g. as a cofactor in melanotic and antioxidative enzymes . Abnormal levels of trace elements , e.g . zinc in melanosomes of the RPE have been associated with aging and AMD , as published by Ulshafer et al. , 1990 , who found decreasing zinc levels in melanosomes of degenerating human RPE cells . In addition , Zn was found to be elevated in subretinal deposits and drusen in sections from AMD patients , suggesting a reallocation of zinc Lengyel et al. , 2007 . Although the results are not consistent , physicians were encouraged by the “Age-related Eye Disease Research Study Group” AREDS , 2001 to recommend zinc substi-tution in AMD treatment . Using AEM , we can now investigate the influence of high and low zinc diet on age related disorders , as initiated by Samuelson using zinc-deficient pigs Samuelson et al. , 1993 . Also iron accumulating in ocular tissues was proposed to be one cause for AMD . However , although iron is contained in neuro-melanin and in the RPE of AMD affected persons , as investigated by histology Wong et al. , 2007 , it is not included in our healthy human melanosomes of RPE and choroid . Therefore , analytical EM has strong relevance for investigating the role of metal ions in age related disorders . 4.3.2 . Lipofuscin Melanosomes and lipofuscin granules could clearly be distin-guished . While melanosomes were the pigments with the largest oxygen about 5 at % and nitrogen about 10 at % mole fractions in the cell , lipofuscin had smaller oxygen mole fractions about 4 at % and nitrogen was found to be only slightly above the limit of detection of 0.4 at % . Melanosomal “markers” like Ca and trace metal ions were also at the limit of detection in lipofuscin granules . However , lipofuscin showed 0.2 at % P , while P was below the limit of detection in melanosomes . Previous qualitative EDX studies are consistent with the results presented here Ulshafer et al. found lipofuscin containing only P and S , while melanosomes contained S , Zn , Ca and Fe Ulshafer et al. , 1990 , and Van der Schaft et al. found additionally Ca , Zn and Cl in lipofuscin and Cu in melanosomes VanderSchaft et al. , 1992 . Despite its chemical and scientific importance , the structure and chemical composition of lipofuscin has not been determined unambiguously but is currently being intensively investigated . The apparent P mole fraction in lipofuscin granules strongly indi-cates a relation to the amount of phospholipids phosphatidylcholine , phosphatidylethanolamine , phosphatidylserine and all-trans-retinal dimer-phosphatidylethanolamine , originating from photoreceptor outer segments Bazan et al. , 1990 Ng et al. , 2008 . In addition , free fatty acids like palmitic acid , arachidonic acid and oleic acid were found in lipofuscin granules Bazan et al. , 1990 . The authors discussed the fact that although lipofuscin was thought to be composed of photoreceptorremnants , lipofuscinandphotoreceptoroutersegments had a different phospholipid composition with the main phospho-lipids found in lipofuscin being phoshatidylcholine . In contrast , OS contained foremost phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphati-dylserinwith higher proportions of 22 6 fatty acids , which were less abundant in lipofuscin . Differences between photoreceptor outer segment and lipofuscin fatty acid composition were proposed to be due to peroxidation of 22 6 fatty acids , the degradation of the segments by lysosomal enzymes phospholipase and peroxidase , but also the presence of further material in the lipofuscin coming from RPE autophagocytosis and lipid components taken up from the blood . 22 6 polyunsaturated fatty acids could also be recycled and transported back to the photoreceptors Bazan et al. , 1990 . The differently modified proteins , found by proteomic studies Brunk and Terman , 2002 Schutt et al. , 2002 Warburton et al. , 2005 Warburton et al. , 2007 also imply the generation from phagocytosed OS together with the autophagocytosis of mitochondrial material Schutt et al. , 2003 . In contrast , Ng et al. 2008 reported the presence of oxidative modifications and bis-retinoids , too , but only fractions of less than 3 wt % proteins . It appears that these contradictory results are due to errors produced by the methods of analysis Ng et al. , 2008 , argued that purified lipofuscin was not used for the previous studies by Brunk and Terman 2002 and Warburton et al. 2005 . In the present work , we found only small nitrogen mole frac-tions close to the detection limit in combination with significant P mole fractions , suggesting that lipofuscin granules lacked func-tional proteins but contained low amounts of N as part of phos-pholipids and A2E , which was also found by Ng et al. 2008 . If metals like Fe , Cu , Zn , Mn and Ca are integrated together with damaged proteins , as published by Jolly et al. , 1995 Jung et al. , 2007 , a low N mole fraction in the lipofuscin should correlate with low metal mole fractions as presented here . Therefore , analytical TEM confirms the findings of Ng et al. 2008 . In addition , analytical TEM does not rely on purification of the material and provides the chemical analysis on individual lipofuscin granules . 4.3.3 . Melanolipofuscin granules Since most authors agree that lipofuscin granules are formed by degradation end products mainly lipids from photoreceptor segment phagocytosis , the composition and protein content of melanolipofuscin remain unclear . Here , melanolipofuscin granules were found to consist of distinct fractions as imaged in TEM bright field images , a dark fraction which had a chemical composition close to melanosomes and a bright fraction with a composition close to lipofuscin . Figs. 5 and 6 show the different mean mole fractions of important elements of RPE pigment granules . Thus , the chemical composition of dark melanolipofuscin and melanosomes are very close , with N being a marker for proteins . On the other hand , bright melanolipofuscin and lipofuscin contain P , a marker for phospholipids . The reason for the increased N mole fraction is not yet clear , but may probably be induced by a significant protein content in bright melanolipofuscin . Using combined analytical methods , as quanti-tative elemental analysis coupled to biochemical and proteomic methods , i.e . TOF-SIMS , we will soon be able to identify the composition of lipofuscin and melanolipofuscin granules and will investigate the pathway leading to the generation of these age pigments and associated pathologies . In summary , melanosomes and lipofuscin granules can be distinguished by the applied methods . It was shown that lipofuscin contained an appreciable mole fraction of P , an indicator for phos-pholipids , while P is below the limit of detection in melanosomes . However , melanosomes do contain significant mole fractions of N , an indicator for proteins and Ca , Cu and Zn , which are ator belowthe minimum detectable mole fraction of the lipofuscin granules . We show for the first time that dark parts of melanolipofuscin granules are of the same chemical composition as melanosomes , while brighter parts are of lipofuscin-like composition but with a significantly increased N mole fraction .

21554925	Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria PNH is a bone marrow disease characterized by intravascular hemolysis , an increased risk of thrombosis , and a variable degree of pancytopenia . The disease results from an acquired mutation in the X-linked PIG-A gene in the hematopoietic stem cell Supplementary data associated with this article can be found in the online version at doi 10.1016 j.exphem.2011.04.003 . HSC , leading to a clone of hematopoietic cells with deficient expression of GPI-anchored proteins GPI-AP . Deficiency of GPI-anchored complement inhibitors CD59 and CD55 on erythrocytes results in chronic intravascular hemolysis upon complement activation . The clinical evolution of PNH arises through clonal expansion of PIG-A deficient HSC . Interestingly , the PIG-A mutation can also be found in a very small percentage of hematopoietic cells in healthy individuals , usually in more mature hematopoietic progenitors [ 1,2 ] . However , in this situation , PIG-A mutated hematopoietic cells do not expand and do not give rise to PNH . Furthermore , in murine PIG-A gene knockout models , the PIG-A deficient clone does not expand either [ 3,4 ] . Apparently , the PIG-A mutation alone can not explain the selective expansion of a PNH clone and other mechanisms are involved . Several observations support a role for immune-mediated bone marrow failure in PNH . For example , a PNH clone is not specific for PNH , but also occurs frequently in other immune-mediated bone marrow failure diseases , such as aplastic anemia AA and myelodysplastic syndromes MDS [ 5–8 ] . Immunosuppressive therapy may ameliorate the marrow failure component of PNH and the presence of a PNH clone in patients with AA orMDS is ofpredictivevalue for the response to immunosuppressive therapy [ 8,9 ] . Further-more , several groups have described the presence of poten-tially oligoclonal T-cell expansions in patients with PNH , AA , and MDS [ 10–15 ] . Taken together , these data indicate a role for autoimmune-mediated bone marrow failure in the presence of a PNH clone . In this setting , the expansion of a PNH clone could be explained by selective survival of GPI-deficient HSCs , whereas normal HSCs are lysed by autoreactive immune effector cells . It has been demonstrated that T cells expressing acti-vating isoforms of natural killer cell receptors NKR , such as killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptors KIR or CD158 isoforms and C-type lectin receptors CLR may be implicated in PNH-related bone marrow failure [ 16 ] . KIR bind to HLA class I molecules and exist in activating and inhibitory isoforms . CLR consist of a hetero-dimer of CD94 coupled to a NKG2 molecule that can either be activating NKG2C or inhibitory NKG2A , both binding to HLA-E . NKG2D is expressed as a homodimer and binds to stress-inducible major histocompatibility complex MHC class I chain-related molecules or human cytomegalovirus UL16 binding proteins . Normally , T cells expressing KIR or CLR are present in low numbers typi-cally 5 % of CD8 ? T cells and consist predominantly of CD8 ? memory T cells [ 17 ] . Upon aging or conditions of chronic immune activation , such as viral infections and autoimmune diseases , they are found at increased frequency , for example , in rheumatoid arthritis , celiac disease , and cytomegalovirus infection [ 18–20 ] . In certain circumstances , T cells expressing activating NKR are capable of T cell receptor TCR independent effector functions , such as cytokine production , cytotoxicity , and proliferation [ 19,21–23 ] . In PNH patients , T cells expressing NKR were found at a slightly increased frequency [ 16 ] . Furthermore , T cell clones expressing activating NKR could be isolated at a high frequency from PNH patient peripheral blood . More importantly , these T cell clones mediated less effi-cient killing of a GPI-deficient K562 cell line compared to GPI-positive K562 cells . These data suggested that T cells expressing activating NKR may promote the expansion of a PNH clone by selectively lysing GPI ? cells . Other studies have described NKG2D ligand expression in bone marrow and in peripheral blood granulocytes of PNH patients . Moreover , anti-NKG2D treatment improved hematopoietic colony formation in vitro , providing further evidence for the involvement of NKG2D-expressing lymphocytes in bone marrow failure in PNH [ 24,25 ] . In this study , we have found significantly increased frequencies of T cells expressing the activating receptors KIR2DS4 , NKG2C , and NKG2D in PNH patients . Fitting their presumed role as autoimmune effectors in bone marrow failure in PNH , we show here that these T cells consist of cytotoxic effector memory T cells coexpressing several activating NKR . Furthermore , they display high cytolytic potential toward hematopoietic cell lines , which in some cases is GPI-dependent , suggesting involvement in bone marrow failure and clonal expansion in PNH . Materials and methods PNH patients Blood samples and bone marrow samples from 39 PNH patients were collected after obtaining informed consent according to Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre institutional procedures .

Cytotoxicity assays Cytolytic activity of NKR ? cytotoxic T lymphocyte CTL lines was determined by standard chromium release assays . Briefly , 106 target cells were labeled with 100 mCi 51Cr Perkin Elmer , Gr€ oningen , The Netherlands for 1.5 hours . Subsequently , 103 target cells were mixed with CTLs in triplicate at various effector to target ratios in 96-well V-bottom plates in a final volume of 150 mL Iscove’s modified Dulbecco’s medium with 10 % fetal calf serum Integro , Zaandam , The Netherlands . Cocultures were incubated for 4 hours at 37 C. Thereafter , 100 mL supernatant of each sample was collected and radioac-tivity was determined by a gamma counter . Percentage of specific lysis was calculated using the following formula % specific cytotoxicity 5 experimental release spontaneous release maximum release spontaneous release 100 . Spontaneous release was typically 25 % of maximum release . K562 cells and its mutagenized GPI-deficient variant [ 26 ] kindly provided by Dr. A. Poggi , Laboratory for Experimental Oncology , National Institute for Cancer Research , Geneva , Italy were used as target cells . In other experiments , CD34 ? GPI-deficient TF-1 cells containing a tetracyclin-inducible PIG-A gene kindly provided by Dr. R. Brodsky , Division of Hematology , Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine , Baltimore , MD , USA were used [ 27 ] . TF-1 cells were cultured with tetracyclin 2 mg mL for O2 days , resulting in expression of GPI-AP in O95 % of cells , or without tetracycline for GPI-deficient cells typically O95 % . KG1a with low and normal expression of GPI-AP were generated by incubating KG1a cells with the GPI-anchor specific enzyme phospholipase C PI-PLC Sigma-Aldrich or medium . Briefly , KG1a cells were incubated for 1 hour at 37 C in IMDM plus 10 % fetal calf serum and 10 % buffer containing 0.05 % bovine serum albumin , 10 mM Tris , 144 mM NaCl at pH 7.4 , with or without PI-PLC at a final concentration of 1 U mL and subsequently used as target cells in 51Cr release assays . Reduced expression of GPI-AP lasted for at least 6 hours data not shown . Statistics Mann-Whitney U-test was used for comparison of T cell and NK cell subset frequencies and absolute numbers . Statistical significance was accepted for p values 0.05 . Two-way analysis of variance ANOVA was used to test for significant differences in specific lysis of GPI ? and GPI-deficient target cells at different effector to target ratios . Linear regression analysis was used to determine correlations between percentages of lymphocyte subsets and clinical characteristics . Results In order to evaluate the role of autoimmunity in the patho-genesis of PNH and the mechanism of expansion of a PNH clone , we have performed immunophenotyping of lympho-cyte subsets in peripheral blood samples of PNH patients , focusing specifically on T cells expressing NKR . In Figure 1A , a representative example of a PNH patient with several NKR-expressing T cell populations is shown . In our cohort of 39 patients , we observed significantly increased percentages p 0.001 and absolute numbers p 5 0.01 of T cells expressing the general marker CD56 as compared to healthy volunteers Fig. 1B . Next , we investigated the expression of various NK cell markers , including KIR and CLR on peripheral blood T cells of PNH patients . Interestingly , a significantly higher percentage of T cells expressing the activating NK cell receptors KIR2DS4 CD158i p 5 0.01 , NKG2D p 0.01 , and NKG2C p 0.01 was found in PNH patients compared to healthy controls Fig. 1C . Moreover , frequencies of T cells expressing CD158b1 b2 , j represent-ing KIR2DL2 , KIR2DL3 , and KIR2DS2 p 5 0.04 were also elevated Fig. 1D , and a trend was observed toward a significantly increased frequency of T cells expressing CD158a h KIR2DS1 KIR2DL1 p 5 0.07 Fig. 1C , D . For the CD158b1 b2 , j and CD158a , h receptors , it is not possible to determine by flow cytometry whether these represent activating or inhibitory receptors because these molecules only differ in their intracellular part . Also , a trend towards an increased frequency of T cells expressing the inhibitory NKG2A molecule p 5 0.05 was observed Fig. 1D . The frequency of CD94-expressing T cells was significantly elevated p 5 0.04 Fig. 1D , correlating with the frequency of NKG2A-and NKG2C-expressing T cells data not shown . In summary , we show that in patients with PNH , the frequency of T cells expressing specific , mainly acti-vating , NKR is increased compared to healthy controls . Correlations between the frequency of KIR-and NKG2-expressing T cells with clinical characteristics of PNH patients such as age , granulocyte clone size , history of aplastic anemia , eculizumab treatment , and duration of disease were not found data not shown . Only for CD158b1 b2 , j and not for other NKR-expressing T cells , a significantly higher frequency was found in patients with serological evidence of past cytomegalovirus infection p 5 0.02 Mann-Whitney U-test , Supplementary Figure E1 online only , available at www.exphem.org . CD56 ? , KIR2DS4 ? , NKG2C ? , and NKG2D ? T cells in PNH patients mainly consist of CD8 ? effector memory T cells and variably coexpress several activating NKR The CD56 ? , KIR2DS4 ? , NKG2C ? , and NKG2D ? T cell populations in PNH patients were further characterized by flow cytometry to determine TCR type , differentiation status , function helper or cytotoxic , and coexpression of NKR . CD56 ? T cells in PNH patients Fig. 2A consist of a highly variable percentage of both TCRab T cells median 62 % range 43 99 % and TCRgd T cells median 21 % range 5 61 % . Furthermore , the number of TCR Va24Ja18-positive T cells , which contain the clas-sical CD1d-restricted NKT cells recognizing glycolipid antigens , is low within the CD56 ? T cell population median 1.3 % range 0.2 2 % . In addition , CD56 ? T cells are predominantly CD8-positive median 60 % range 17 88 % , classically corresponding to cytotoxic function . In the majority of patients , a small percentage of CD56 ? T cells median 2.3 % range 0.5 23.7 % expresses CD16 at low levels . Next , we determined the differentiation status of CD56 ? , KIR2DS4 ? , NKG2C ? , and NKG2D ? T cells , defined by the expression of CCR7 and CD45RA [ 28 ] . CD56 ? T cells predominantly consist of T effector memory TEM , CD45RA , CCR7 median 18 % range 3 33 % and T effector memory CD45RA ? T cells TEMRA , CD45RA ? , CCR7 median 78 % range 69 93 % in both PNH patients Fig. 2A and controls data not shown . No na€ ? ve CD45RA ? ? , CCR7 ? median 0.6 % range 0 3 % or central memory T cells TCM , CD45RA , CCR7 ? median 0.4 % range 0 1 % are present within this population . Phenotypical characterization of KIR2DS4 ? , NKG2C ? , and NKG2D ? T cells is comparable to CD56 ? T cells and again shows that these predominantly consist of CD8 ? TEMRA cells and TEM cells with a highly variable percentage of TCRgd T cells , and a low frequency of na€ ? ve and TCM cells . Generally , expression of CD16 is low in most patients Fig. 2A . Whether NKR-expressing T cells are activated is deter-mined by the balance between activating and inhibitory signals . Therefore , we examined the coexpression patterns of various NKR on KIR2DS4 ? , NKG2C ? , and NKG2D ? T cells by 10-color flow cytometry . The majority of KIR2DS4 ? T cells coexpresses either only NKG2D median 24 % range 2 74 % , or a combination of acti-vating NKG2D and NKG2C , and CD158b1 b2 , j median 16 % range 1 55 % Fig. 2B . Similarly , NKG2C ? T cells also coexpress NKG2D median 21 % range 3 71 % , or a combination of CD158b1 b2 , j and activating NKG2C and NKG2D median 20 % range 1 60 % Fig. 2C . Analysis of NKG2D ? T cells , which represents a much larger subset compared to the KIR2DS4 ? and NKG2C ? T cell subsets , revealed that these T cells generally do not express other NKR median 77 % range 53 84 % Fig. 2D . Collectively , these data demonstrate that PNH patient peripheral blood contains elevated numbers of T cells expressing CD56 and specific activating NKRs such as KIR2DS4 , NKG2C , and NKG2D displaying a cytotoxic TEM or TEMRA and activation prone phenotype . These find-ings fit their putative role as effectors in autoreactivity to hematopoietic progenitor cells in PNH patients . To determine the presumed role of T cells with activating NKR in bone marrow failure in PNH patients and the expansion of a PNH clone , their ability for differential killing of GPI-positive and GPI-negative hematopoietic progenitor cells was assessed . Therefore , CD8 ? CTL lines expressing the activating NKR KIR2DS4 and NKG2D were generated by sorting KIR2DS4 ? CD8 ? T cells from periph-eral blood or bone marrow of two patients . The resulting CTL lines were functionally analyzed in 51Cr release assays for cytotoxicity toward normal and GPI-deficient variants of leukemia cell lines K562 , TF-1 , and KG1a . All CTL lines expressed CD55 , indicating that they did not originate from the PNH clone data not shown . Two CD8 ? CTL lines , designated OC5 and OB8 , were isolated from the bone marrow of PNH patient 1 . Both CTL lines highly express the activating NKR NKG2D and KIR2DS4 Figs . 3A and 4A . As determined by TCR-Vb family analysis , O90 % of CD8 ? T cells express a single TCR-Vb chain , i.e. , Vb5.1 for CTL OC5 and Vb7 for CTL OB8 , indicating clonal origin . CTL OC5 is highly cytotoxic toward TF-1 , even at low effector to target ratios in three independent experiments Fig. 3B , but not toward K562 or KG1a data not shown . In one of three experiments , significantly higher cytotoxic lysis of GPI ? TF-1 cells was demonstrated p 5 0.03 , two-way ANOVA Fig. 3B , left panel , whereas in the other two experiments no significant differences were observed Fig. 3B , middle and right panel . Consistent with different clonal origin , the cytotoxicity pattern of CTL OB8 differs from CTL OC5 , being highly cytotoxic toward KG1a Fig. 5C , but not TF-1 or K562 data not shown . PI-PLC treatment of KG1a cells efficiently reduces expression of GPI-AP CD55 and CD59 , and to a lower extent also CD58 , which exists in both a GPI-anchored and a transmembrane form Fig. 4B . Significantly lower cytotoxic activity toward PI-PLC treated KG1a p 0.0001 and p 5 0.0003 two-way ANOVA was observed in two of three indepen-dent experiments Fig. 4C , left and middle panel . In a third experiment , no differences in cytotoxicity were observed Fig. 4C , right panel . Another NKR-expressing CD8 ? CTL line , designated L6 , was isolated from peripheral blood of PNH patient 2 . Besides KIR2DS4 , this TCRab-positive CTL line expresses the activating receptors NKG2C and NKG2D , and CD158a , h and CD158b1 b2 , j Fig. 5A . This CTL line is highly cytotoxic towards TF-1 cells Fig. 5B and MHC-deficient K562 cells Fig. 5C . For K562 , no differ-ences in susceptibility for cytotoxic lysis were observed . However , GPI-negative TF-1 cells were less efficiently lysed by CTL L6 as shown in two independent experiments p 0.0001 and p 5 0.005 , two-way ANOVA . In summary , our results demonstrate that in certain but not in all circumstances GPI-deficient hematopoietic progenitor cells are less susceptible to NKR ? CTL-mediated lysis . High expression levels of activating receptors on ex vivo expanded CTLs may mask subtle differences in cytotoxicity towards GPI ? and GPI target cells that are , however , relevant in vivo . In particular , high-dose IL-2 or IL-15 was reported to induce upregulation or acquisition of NKR expression during in vitro culture and , in some cases , even TCR-independent killing capacity [ 29–31 ] . Therefore , we compared expression levels of the activating receptors NKp44 , NKp46 , NKp30 , NKp80 , CD48 , and DNAX acces-sory molecule-1 DNAM-1 levels on in vitro cultured CTL lines to peripheral blood CD8 ? KIR2DS4 ? T cells Supplementary Figure 2 online only , available at www. exphem.org . NKp44 , NKp46 , NKp30 , and NKp80 were not expressed on either CD8 ? KIR2DS4 ? T cells or CTL lines data not shown . In contrast , CTL lines expressed higher levels of CD48 than peripheral blood CD8 ? KIR2DS4 ? T cells . K562 , TF-1 , and KG1a target cells all express DNAM-1 ligands CD155 and CD112 . The CD48 ligand CD244 is highly expressed on KG1a cells and at low levels on TF-1 and K562 cells Supplementary Figure 3 online only , available at www.exphem.org . Thus , the interaction between CD48 on CTLs and CD244 on target cells may be one of the factors contributing to higher in vitro cytotoxic activity and of influence whether GPI-dependent lysis occurs . Discussion The mechanism of expansion of a PNH clone is an unsolved question in the pathogenesis of PNH . Autoimmune-mediated bone marrow failure in which GPI-deficient hematopoietic progenitor cells preferen - tially survive may account for the expansion of a PNH clone . In this study , we show that T cells expressing the general NK-cell marker CD56 are highly elevated in patients with PNH as compared to healthy controls . Furthermore , in PNH patients , the frequency of T cells expressing the activating NKR KIR2DS4 , NKG2C , and NKG2D is significantly increased . Fitting their presumed role in mediating autoimmune attack , these T cell popula-tions predominantly consist of highly differentiated CD8 ? TEM and TEMRA cells , coexpressing one or several activating NKR . Increased frequencies of peripheral blood CD56 ? T cells are found upon aging [ 32 ] and in autoimmune disease , such as rheumatoid arthritis [ 33 ] , Behc¸et’s disease [ 34 ] , and sarcoidosis [ 35 ] . Previously large-granular lymphocyte-like clonal T-cell expansions with expression of CD56 were also described in cases of PNH [ 14 ] . CD56 ? T cells are usually oligoclonal [ 32 ] , potent producers of interferon-g , perforin , and granzyme-B [ 36 ] and , as in our study , express effector memory T-cell markers . Triggering CD56 can costimulate T cells but may also induce TCR-independent T cell activation [ 32 ] . Both their increased frequency in other autoimmune diseases and their effector memory phenotype with high cytotoxic potential supports a role for CD56 ? T cells in autoimmunity in PNH . As our study indicates , the CD56 ? T cell population is not composed of classical , CD1d-restricted NKT cells expressing the invariant Va24Ja18 TCR . However , this population may contain nonclassical NKT cells , which have a more diverse TCR repertoire [ 37 ] . NKT cells recog-nize glycolipid antigens presented in the context of the nonclassical MHC molecule CD1d . GPI has been proposed as a natural ligand for CD1d [ 38 ] and recently it has been described that GPI-APs are able to provide costimulation to CD1d-restricted T cells [ 39 ] . Therefore , NKT cells may exert differential killing of GPI-deficient and normal HSCs in PNH . However , further research is necessary to determine whether or not NKR-expressing T cells in PNH patients contain nonclassical NKT cells . Involvement of NKR and their ligands in the pathogen-esis of PNH was suggested by several authors [ 16,24,25 ] . Poggi et al. [ 16 ] investigated the presence of T cells ex-pressing NKR in PNH patients , but did not find significant differences in either frequencies or absolute numbers compared to healthy controls . In comparison to the study of Poggi et al. , we included three times as many patients and more specifically investigated the presence of indi-vidual KIR and NKG2 receptors instead of using a pan KIR2D marker for KIR and CD94 for NKG2 receptors . Thus , we were able to demonstrate a significantly increased frequency of T cells expressing mostly activating NKR , including CD158b1 b2 , j , CD158i , NKG2C , and NKG2D in peripheral blood of PNH patients . Interestingly , NKG2D ligand expression has been observed in bone marrow and peripheral blood granulocytes of PNH patients [ 24 ] . Improvement of in vitro hematopoietic colony forma-tion in the presence of an anti-NKG2D antibody further supports involvement of NKG2D-expressing lymphocytes in bone marrow failure in PNH . To investigate the putative role of NKR ? CD8 ? TEM cells in bone marrow damage in PNH patients , we per-formed cytotoxicity studies with KIR2DS4 ? NKG2D ? CTL lines isolated from PNH bone marrow or peripheral blood . Interestingly , potent cytolytic activity towards hematopoietic progenitor cell lines was observed in different model cell lines , KG1a and TF-1 . For several CTL lines , of which one example was shown , cytotoxic activity toward the MHC class I negative K562 cell line was also observed , indicating that these CTL lines possess TCR-independent killing capacity , which may instead be mediated via activating NKR . For other KIR2DS4 ? NKG2D ? CTLs , no cytolytic activity toward K562 was observed , suggesting that these mediate a TCR-dependent antigen response in the bone marrow of this patient for which NKR may provide costimulation . Cytotoxic activity toward hematopoietic progenitor cell lines by activating NKR-expressing T cell lines suggests involvement in bone marrow failure in PNH . However , to explain clonal expansion in PNH as well , these T cells should exhibit higher cytolytic activity toward GPI ? HSC . We indeed observed a higher cytolytic activity toward GPI ? variants of CD34 ? hematopoietic cell lines in some but not all experiments , suggesting that multiple factors determine whether GPI-dependent differences in cytotoxic lysis occur . Several groups have tried to demonstrate such differences and , as yet , no definitive consensus has been achieved . Karadimitris et al. studied the in vitro sensitivity of normal and GPI Epstein-Barr virus transformed B cell lines to autologous Epstein-Barr virus specific CTLs and did not observe differences [ 40 ] . In addition , Dingli et al. presented an interesting mathematical simulation support-ing a ‘‘neutral evolution model , ’’ in which clonal expansion can occur even without a survival advantage . Their model accurately predicts the known incidence of PNH , especially in a setting of decreased stem cells numbers , as is the case in immune-mediated marrow failure [ 41 ] . In contrast , others did observe differences in susceptibility for CTL or NK cell mediated cytotoxic lysis in vitro and in vivo , supporting the theory of autoimmune-mediated selection resulting in clonal expansion . Hanaoka et al. found decreased susceptibility of GPI-deficient K562 cells for cytotoxicity mediated by an NK cell line [ 25 ] . Furthermore , Poggi et al. demonstrated less efficient killing of GPI K562 than GPI ? K562 by NKR-expressing T cells isolated from PNH patients . In vivo evidence supporting the immune selection theory was provided by Murakami et al. , who nicely demonstrated in a murine transplant model that GPI-deficient cells preferentially survived alloreactive CD4 ? T cell attack [ 42 ] . Finally , Savage et al. showed that GPI-deficient CD34 ? cells isolated from PNH patients were less susceptible to apoptosis induction upon coculture with autologous T cells prestimulated with TF-1 cells [ 27 ] . Although we did not always find clear differences , this does not necessarily exclude a role for differential suscep-tibility for cytotoxic lysis of HSC in vivo . First , leukemic cell lines used in our functional studies might be better capable of stimulating T cell responses than normal HSC , for example , by using the activating receptor ligands CD112 , CD155 , and CD244 . More importantly , in our experiments , we have used ex vivo expanded CTLs . These may become highly cytolytic during in vitro culture , for example , by acquiring additional activating receptors during in vitro culture . Of the receptors tested , we found only CD48 expression to be increased upon in vitro CTL culture . Still , differences in stimulatory capacity of cell lines and HSC , and a higher cytolytic capacity of in vitro cultured CTLs may mask subtle differences in cytotoxicity that are , however , highly relevant in vivo . In conclusion , we found increased frequencies and absolute numbers of T cells expressing the NKR CD56 in PNH patient peripheral blood compared to healthy controls . Furthermore , we observed elevated frequencies of CD8 ? TEMRA cells expressing activating NKR , such as KIR2DS4 , NKG2C , and NKG2D with the capability of targeting hematopoietic progenitor cell lines . Our results suggest that these T cells are the autoimmune effectors directed toward PNH CD34 ? hematopoietic progenitor cells , and may have emerged as a consequence of an ongoing chronic immune response in PNH bone marrow . However , further studies are required to gain more insight into the response of these T cells to immunosuppressive treatment and subsequent recovery of marrow failure .

21593202	RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS—Human adipocytes Ovelopmenttherepresents besity is hallmark of the metabolic syn-drome and a major global health problem that frequently associates with the de-of chronic diseases , including type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease 1 . A complex inter-organ cross-talk scenario between adipose tissue and other central and peripheral organs underlies the progression of these diseases , with adipose tissue on top of the cross-talk hierarchy 2 . This is attributed to the huge diversity of signaling and mediator molecules released from adipose tissue , which is now considered one of the major endo-crine organs 3,4 . Recent data show that adipokines , which are proteins and peptides released by various adi-pose tissue cells , create a complex interconnected net-work of feedback loops 5 . Enlargement of adipose tissue leads to dysregulation of adipokine secretion , representing a potential critical pathogenic link among obesity , insulin resistance IR , and type 2 diabetes 1 . Therefore , we conducted a comprehensive proteomic profiling of condi-tioned media derived from differentiated , primary human adipocytes . This resulted in the identification of novel adipokines , including the exoprotease dipeptidyl peptidase 4 DPP4 . DPP4 is a ubiquitously expressed transmembrane glyco-protein that cleaves N-terminal dipeptides from a variety of substrates , including growth factors and hormones , neuro-peptides , and chemokines 6 . Two substrates of DPP4 , glucagon-like peptide-1 GLP-1 and gastric inhibitory polypeptide GIP , are released from the intestinal mucosa and responsible for 60 % of postprandial insulin secre-tion , the so-called incretin effect 7 . Because GLP-1 re-mains active under hyperglycemic conditions in type 2 diabetes , DPP4 has gained considerable interest as a ther-apeutic target , and a variety of DPP4-inhibitors that pro-long the insulinotropic effect of GLP1 are now in clinical use as antidiabetic drugs 8 . Substantial DPP4 activity is also found in plasma and other body fluids because of a soluble form of DPP4 lacking the cytoplasmic tail and the transmembrane region of this protein 9 . Both the mem-brane abundance and the circulating activity of DPP4 have been found to be altered in a variety of neurologic and inflammatory diseases 6 . However , although a fraction of soluble DPP4 most likely originates from cells of the im-mune system 10 , the major source of circulating DPP4 and its regulation remain unknown . Furthermore , essentially no data are currently available regarding the potential effects of soluble DPP4 on insulin target tissues , including muscle and fat . In the present in-vestigation , we combined in vitro experiments with two independent clinical studies , aiming to validate DPP4 as a novel adipokine and to characterize the association of DPP4 to different parameters of the metabolic syndrome . We show that 1 DPP4 is a novel adipokine released from differentiated human adipocytes and that it may exert autocrine and paracrine effects leading to IR 2 DPP4 expression is substantially elevated in visceral fat of obese subjects and that serum DPP4 correlates with adipocyte size and all parameters of the metabolic syndrome and 3 adipose tissue explants from obese subjects release sub-stantially more DPP4 with a prominent decrease after weight reduction . In light of the well accepted interference of DPP4 with the incretin system , we now suggest that DPP4 may play a role in linking obesity to IR and the metabolic syndrome . RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Clinical studies of DPP-4 concentration in serum and DPP4 release Smooth muscle cell culture and proliferation . Primary human coronary RESULTS DPP4 is a novel adipokine exhibiting regulated release from human adipocytes . Comprehensive proteomic pro-filing of the adipocyte secretome led to the identification of 347 proteins , with 263 proteins being predicted or anno-tated as secretory proteins data to be presented in an-other publication . Although 80 % of these proteins have been reported in earlier studies 17–19 , our approach has identified .40 novel adipokines , including DPP4 . To validate this novel adipokine , we used in vitro dif-ferentiated human adipocytes and macrophages isolated from adipose tissue . DPP4 expression in human adipo-cytes is significantly increased during differentiation with a maximum reached at day 7 fourfold over undifferentiated control Fig. 1A . DPP4 expression is paralleled by a marked release of this adipokine Fig. 1B , which was sig-nificantly elevated compared with the undifferentiated con-trol starting at day 4 and increasing up to day 9 1.1 ng mL released over 24 h by 3.5 3 105 cells . DPP4 in the super-natant of adipocytes was quantified by ELISA and confirmed by Western blotting Fig. 1B . We further analyzed the re-lease of DPP4 with prominent regulators of adipocyte se-cretory activity , such as troglitazone , TNF-a , insulin , and adiponectin 15,20,21 . As shown in Fig. 1C , DPP4 release is significantly upregulated by TNF-a and insulin . In addition to adipocytes , adipose tissue-derived macrophages release measurable amounts of DPP4 Fig. 1D . However , this is only one third compared with adipocytes , pointing to a ma-jor contribution of adipocytes to DPP4 output from adipose tissue . Soluble DPP4 exerts direct effects on fat and muscle cells . The soluble form of DPP4 may bind to the extra-cellular matrix 22 and affect a variety of cells , yet this has not been investigated so far . To assess potential direct effects of soluble DPP4 on peripheral cells , we studied insulin signaling in adipocytes and skeletal muscle cells . DPP4 treatment of human adipocytes results in a dose-dependent decrease in insulin-stimulated Akt phosphory-lation , which reached significance using a dose of 200 ng mL Fig. 2A . This demonstrates an autocrine effect of DPP4 on adipocytes . It should be noted that circulating DPP4 concentrations were found in the range of 200 to 600 ng mL in healthy patients . The effect of DPP4 on insulin-stimulated Akt phosphorylation can be completely blocked by a spe-cific DPP4 inhibitor Fig. 2B . Validation experiments using this compound proved inhibition of DPP4 in vitro , which remained unaltered for a period of at least 8 h data not shown . Similar to adipocytes , DPP4 also induces IR in skeletal muscle cells at the level of Akt phosphorylation in a dose-dependent way but less prominent compared with adipocytes Fig. 2C and D . To prove whether DPP4 has a functional impact not only on insulin signaling , we de-termined DPP4-stimulated proliferation and insulin signal-ing in primary human smooth muscle cells . In addition to the induction of IR at the level of Akt in this cell type , DPP4 induced a 1.6-fold increase in cell proliferation that can be completely blocked by the DPP4 inhibitor Fig. 3A–C . DPP4 is elevated in serum of obese patients and correlates with various anthropometric and clinical parameters clinical study 1 . Measuring DPP4 in serum from age-matched lean and morbidly obese subjects pa-tient characteristics in Supplementary Table 1 revealed that obese subjects are characterized by significantly in-creased DPP4 concentrations Fig. 4A . DPP4 expression in adipose tissue biopsies from the same patients revealed that DPP4 protein expression is regulated by both the fatness of the individual and the adipose tissue depot Fig. 4B . Although there is only a trend for higher DPP4 ex-pression in visceral fat of lean subjects , obese patients are characterized by significantly higher DPP4 in visceral ad-ipose tissue compared with subcutaneous adipose tissue . Furthermore , expression of DPP4 in both depots is sig-nificantly higher in obese subjects compared with lean subjects . DPP4 levels positively correlate with BMI , the size of subcutaneous and visceral adipocytes , insulin , and leptin , whereas a negative correlation with age and adi-ponectin could be found Fig. 5A–G . Adjusting DPP4 for age has no impact on these correlations . However , when adjusted for BMI , DPP4 serum concentrations significantly correlate only with the size of subcutaneous adipocytes P 0.04 , r 0.32 , pointing to a close relation between the size of adipocytes and the release of this adipokine . FIG. 4 . DPP4 serum concentration and expression in adipose tissue from lean compared with obese patients clinical study 1 . A Sera from lean n 20 and morbidly obese n 20 men were analyzed for their DPP4 concentration by ELISA . Data are mean values 6 SEM , *P 0.05 vs. lean group . B DPP4 protein level in adipose tissue biopsies was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot . Data were normalized to the protein level of actin and are expressed relative to subcutaneous adi-pose tissue from lean subjects . Data are mean values 6 SEM , n 8 for lean and n 14 for obese patients , *P 0.05 respective subcutaneous or designated group . DPP4 is released from subcutaneous adipose tissue in vitro clinical study 2 . We investigated lean and obese subjects after weight reduction and analyzed the release of DPP4 from whole adipose tissue . Adipocytes from lean subjects were significantly smaller than those from obese patients Fig. 6A . Surgery-induced weight loss reduced the average size of adipocytes below the size from lean subjects . DPP4 release is significantly increased from ad-ipose tissue of obese subjects compared with lean subjects Fig. 6B , whereas weight reduction by bariatric surgery normalized the DPP4 release to the lean level . This was paralleled by a significant reduction in the circulating DPP4 level , supporting the notion that adipose tissue is an important source of serum DPP4 Fig. 6C . In the group of lean and obese subjects , DPP4 release from adipose tissue significantly correlates with BMI , waist circumference , percent body fat , triglycerides , HOMA , adipocyte volume , and leptin , whereas the correlation is negative with HDL-cholesterol Fig. 6D–K . All of these factors are denomi-nators of the metabolic syndrome . It is noteworthy that leptin shows similar correlations with the above men-tioned parameters , with the exception of triglycerides , for which no correlation could be found . Notably , the release of DPP4 from adipose tissue correlates with many param-eters that correlate with circulating DPP4 concentrations . There is also a strong correlation between adipose secre-tion of leptin and DPP4 Fig. 6K . DPP4 serum concentrations and release from adipose tissue are significantly related to the metabolic syndrome . In both obese patient groups providing data for circulating DPP4 levels and DPP4 release from adipose tissue explants , the respective concentrations of DPP4 are significantly increased in subjects with a risk score for the metabolic syndrome of $ 3 , as calculated according to the Adult Treatment Panel-III guidelines Fig. 7A and B . By performing the same analysis for the circulating levels of leptin , monocyte chemotactic protein-1 , RANTES reg-ulated upon activation , normal T cell expressed and se-creted , plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 , chemerin , and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein , we did not find any such relationship with the metabolic syndrome data not shown . In contrast , adiponectin serum levels were sig-nificantly decreased in patients with the metabolic syn-drome data not shown . Including the lean subjects in this type of analysis does not change the outcome of this analysis , and it should be noted that the relationship of DPP4 with the risk score for the metabolic syndrome in the obese subjects is independent from BMI . DISCUSSION Our proteomics approach identified DPP4 as a novel adi-pokine released by fully differentiated human adipocytes . This was confirmed by Western blot , ELISA , and deter-mination of enzymatic activity . DPP4 release increased substantially on fat cell differentiation , and comparison with preadipocytes and adipose tissue macrophages showed that adipocytes most likely represent the major source of DPP4 released from the intact organ to the circulation . DPP4 is a multifunctional , type II integral membrane glycoprotein exhibiting ubiquitous expression , including adipose tissue 23 , being highly abundant in the kidney , on T lymphocytes and endothelial cells 22 . DPP4 is certainly different from many other adipokines in that 1 the protein is not secreted but released from the plasma membrane as soluble DPP4 subsequent to proteolytic cleavage 24 , 2 DPP4 exerts dual functions both as a regulatory protease and a binding protein , and 3 this protein is already an established target for treatment of type 2 diabetes 8 , supporting our notion that DPP4 may potentially link adipose tissue to type 2 diabetes and the metabolic syndrome . Regulators of DPP4 release are presently unknown , but we show that both insulin and TNF-a augment the shedding of soluble DPP4 by 50 % despite an unaltered expression . Thus , factors related to IR and adipose tissue inflammation enhance the release of this novel adipokine from the fat cell . In addition to the endocrine effects of DPP4 released to the circulation , both cell surface resident and soluble DPP4 may have multiple autocrine and paracrine functional implications for adi-pose tissue physiology . First , DPP4 recruits adenosine deaminase to the cell surface 25 , which may modulate the well established antilipolytic effects of adenosine . Sec-ond , DPP4 is a strong inhibitor of the antilipolytic activity of neuropeptide Y 23 , which is one of the best peptide sub-strates of the enzyme 26 . Therefore , enhanced abundance of both resident and soluble DPP4 within adipose tissue of obese subjects may substantially augment the lipolytic activity of enlarged adipocytes . Finally , DPP4 inactivates or alters the specificity of many chemokines , including RANTES , eotaxin , macrophage-derived chemokine , stromal-derived factor-1 , and many others 22 , making it likely that DPP4 plays a yet undefined functional role in the intraorgan cross-talk among macrophages , adipocytes , and other com-ponents of the stroma-vascular fraction . So far , the direct effects of soluble DPP4 on isolated cells have not been investigated , although it binds to the extracellular matrix and may exert signaling functions 22 . We demonstrate for the first time that DPP4 consis-tently impairs insulin signaling at the level of Akt in three different primary cell types , namely , adipocytes , skeletal muscle , and smooth muscle cells . Enzymatic activity of DPP4 seems to be involved in this process , but DPP4 inhibitors may also affect the binding properties of sDPP4 to a putative receptor . This issue is currently under in-vestigation in our laboratory . It may be speculated that DPP4 exerts an autocrine action on adipocytes , which may be of particular interest for perivascular fat , where DPP4 may also act in a paracrine endocrine fashion on the vas-cular wall . DPP4 induces proliferation of human vascular cells in parallel to an impairment of insulin signaling , suggesting a potential role in obesity-associated vascular complications . In this study , we used DPP4 concentrations that match circulating levels that were measured in both lean and obese subjects . Because obese patients are char-acterized by significantly increased circulating DPP4 , it may be speculated that DPP4 may interfere with insulin sensi-tivity not only in adipose tissue but also in other insulin-sensitive peripheral organs . This would substantially extend the current view of DPP4 as a target for treatment of type 2 diabetes . Future work will be needed to address the mech-anism and the functional role of these effects in the patho-genesis of IR and obesity-associated complications . Serum DPP4 is altered in many pathophysiologic con-ditions , such as different types of cancer , allergic asthma , or hepatitis C 10 . To the best of our knowledge , this is the first study to analyze circulating DPP4 in the context of obesity and adipose tissue . Morbidly obese men are char-acterized by elevated DPP4 levels compared with lean controls . DPP4 serum concentrations are significantly correlated with the BMI , the size of adipocytes in sub-cutaneous and visceral fat , and the adipocyte hormones adiponectin negatively and leptin , showing that DPP4 is related to not only increased body weight but also other important parameters of adipose tissue in particular . DPP4 is negatively associated with age , but all of the above mentioned parameters are still significantly correlated with DPP4 , even after adjustment for age . In a different manner , BMI adjustment causes the disappearance of most of these correlations , with the exception of the size of subcutaneous adipocytes . In addition to circulating DPP4 , the protein expression of this adipokine is significantly different not only between lean and obese subjects but also between their fat depots . Former studies report con-tradicting data , describing both decreased and increased mRNA expression of DPP4 in adipose tissue of obese men FIG. 7 . DPP4 in serum and release from adipose tissue explants in re-lation to a risk score for the metabolic syndrome . A risk score for the metabolic syndrome was calculated for all obese subjects in whom se-rum and adipose tissue explants were analyzed . Patients with a risk score of ‡3 were qualified as “with metabolic syndrome MS .” Patients with a score of £2 were qualified as “without MS.” Data were analyzed using a t test . Data are mean values 6 SEM . *P 0.05 , **P 0.01 . 23,27 . We now clearly demonstrate at the protein level that obesity leads to a prominent induction of DPP4 abundance in both subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissue and that the visceral fat exhibits the highest DPP4 level in obese subjects . Therefore , we conclude that en-largement of visceral adipocytes in obesity may sub-stantially contribute to the augmented level of circulating DPP4 in obese patients . It is noteworthy that we measured DPP4 serum concentration and not its activity . However , in additional experiments , other samples from the same patients were used to determine DPP4 activity that is sig-nificantly correlated with circulating DPP4 levels data not shown . Thus , DPP4 activity is also significantly increased in obese compared with lean subjects . DPP4 expression in adipose tissue is increased in obese compared with lean individuals , a fact that is reflected by an increased release of DPP4 from adipose tissue explants of obese patients compared with lean controls . Similar to circulating DPP4 , its release from adipose tissue correlates with various classic markers for the metabolic syndrome , namely , BMI , waist circumference and plasma triglycerides , and HOMA as an index of IR , as well as with fat cell vol-ume and the adipokine leptin . In addition , DPP4 release can be reversed to normal levels by surgery-induced weight loss , which is also reflected by DPP4 being signif-icantly reduced in serum of these patients . With the ex-ception of one study reporting on DPP4 levels in obese children before and after weight loss 28 , this is the first description of significantly decreased DPP4 levels after weight loss induced by obesity surgery in adults . Thus , in obesity , both circulating levels of DPP4 and DPP4 release by adipose tissue are increased but can be reduced to control levels by substantial weight loss . Both circulating DPP4 and DPP4 release by adipose tissue correlate strongly with the metabolic syndrome . Thus , DPP4 may be of relevance as a novel biomarker of the metabolic syndrome and for detection of obese sub-jects at high risk for obesity-associated complications . Future studies are needed to address this important issue and to define the molecular pathways that link adipose DPP4 to the metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes . An adipose-specific knockout of DPP4 would be required to prove a causal role of this protein , and this mouse model is currently under development in our laboratory . However , several lines of evidence support our notion that the novel adipokine links obesity to the metabolic syndrome . First , DPP4 impairs the function of the incretin system , which is of key importance for glucose homeostasis 29 . Incretin-based therapies are known to preserve b-cell function and to exert salutary effects on blood pressure and lipid profile 30 . Second , DPP4 inhibitors are well known to improve glucose tolerance in animal models of obesity 31 . More important , chronic DPP4 inhibition in ZDF rats was shown to delay the onset of type 2 diabetes 31 . Finally , pre-clinical data suggest that GLP-1 is cardioprotective 32 , and DPP4 inhibition was shown to improve cardiovascular outcomes in rodents 33 . Our data strongly support the current view 20 that adipocytes and specifically adipose tissue play a major , most likely causative role in the pathogenesis of metabolic diseases . In summary , we showed that DPP4 is a novel adipokine that is substantially overexpressed in visceral fat from obese subjects and exhibits an augmented release in obe-sity . Soluble DPP4 exerts autocrine and paracrine effects and impairs insulin signaling . We further observe a tight correlation of DPP4 release to adipocyte cell size , and plasma levels of DPP4 strongly correlate with the risk of having the metabolic syndrome . Therefore , we suggest that DPP4 is a novel biomarker and a potential link be-tween obesity and the metabolic syndrome .

Introduction Cataract , the accumulation of light-scattering aggregates in the eye lens , affects an estimated 20 million people , and is the leading cause of blindness worldwide Brian and Taylor , 2001 . In the United States , cataract affects one in six persons over the age of 40 , and with prevalence increasingwith age , affects 50 % of persons over theage of 80 Friedman et al. , 2008 . No successful preventive therapies have beendeveloped , andsurgeryremainstheonlyeffectivetreatmentfor cataract Nanavaty et al. , 2006 . Though cataract surgery has a high success rate , surgery is costlyand remains unavailable to much of the developing world , leading to a disproportionate occurrence of blindness in poverty-stricken regions Brian and Taylor , 2001 . The gamma crystallins are members of the bg superfamily of structural proteins , and are a major component in the mature fiber cells of the vertebrate lens McFall-Ngai et al. , 1985 Siezen et al. , 1987 . These proteins are expressed early in lens development , and enriched in the nucleus , the oldest part of the lens Graw , 2009 Siezen et al. , 1988 . The nucleus is densely packed with protein , where concentrations reach as high as 450 mg ml , accounting for nearly 70 % of the wet cell mass Fagerholm et al. , 1981 . Packing of crystallin proteins into the fiber cells contributes structure to the lens tissue , and helps maintain the shape of the lens , which is critical for focusing light on the retina Cooper et al. , 1994 Delaye and Tardieu , 1983 Oyster , 1999 . Human Gamma D Crystallin HgD-Crys is one of the most abundant members of the bg-crystallin family in the lens . This 173 residue protein has two homologous domains , each containing two Greek key motifs with intercalated anti-parallel beta sheet structure Basak et al. , 2003 Slingsby and Clout , 1999 . The folding and unfolding pathways of HgD-Crys have been extensively character-ized in vitro . Equilibrium experiments with HgD-Crys demonstrated that folding proceeds via an intermediate consisting of an unfolded N-terminal domain N-td and a folded C-terminal domain C-td Flaugh et al. , 2005a , b Mills et al. , 2007 . Kinetic unfolding and refolding studies indicate that the folding of HgD-Crys is nucleated by the more stable C-td Flaugh et al. , 2005a , b Mills et al. , 2007 . Both hydrophobic and polar interactions at the domain interface helps to stabilize the N-td Das et al. , 2010 Flaugh et al. , 2005a , b Mills et al. , 2007 . Analysis of human cataract indicated that proteins found in lens aggregates are heavily damaged and modified in comparison to soluble lens proteins Hanson et al. , 2000 . As the lens ages , proteins in the lens can experience damage due to post-translational modi-fications such as truncation , deamidation , and glycation Hains and Truscott , 2010 Hanson et al. , 2000 Lampi et al. , 1998 Takemoto et al. , 1985 Ueda et al. , 2002 , as well as photo-oxidation of tryp-tophans and other residues Kurzel et al. , 1973 McCarty and Taylor , 2002 . These damages lower the kinetic barrier to unfolding , and induce partial unfolding of lens proteins David et al. , 1996 Flaugh et al. , 2006 Takata et al. , 2008 . The partial unfolding of the protein structure exposes hydrophobic residues normally buried in the native state , making them more susceptible to aggregation in vitro Roder and Colón , 1997 . Glutamine to glutamic acid replacement in HgD-Crys , which mimic oxidative damage in the lens , destabilized HgD-Crys in vitro , generating aggregation-prone partially unfolded intermediates Flaugh et al. , 2006 . In age-related cataract , damaged proteins can accumulate over time without clearance from the lens , and these aggregation-prone conformations may seed the formation of cataract Hains and Truscott , 2007 Harrington et al. , 2007 Zigler and Goosey , 1984 . Lens protein modifications resulting from mutations can also provide insight into cataract formation . A progressive cataract phenotype in mice was caused by a single point mutation F9 S , in Murine gS Crystallin Everett et al. , 1994 . Histological studies of mutant homozygous mice revealed that F9S Murine gS Crystallin impeded the differentiation of lens epithelial cells to lens fiber cells , while biochemical experiments revealed the protein is temperature-sensitive to unfolding in vitro , which can lead to aggregation Sinha et al. , 2001 . When the analogous mutation was made in HgD-Crys , in vitro folding studies demonstrated that the mutant destabilized the N-td , but had no effect on the stabilityof the C-td Moreau and King , 2009 . Furthermore , these studies showed that destabilization in the N-td accelerated unfolding in vitro , which suggests that reduced stability of the mutant is related to the pathology of the cataract Lee et al. , 2010 Moreau and King , 2009 . A congenital mutation shown to cause cataract , I90 F , was identified in Murine gD Crystallin Graw et al. , 2004 . Studies on the stability of the analogous mutation in HgD-Crys demonstrated that the amino acid replacement disrupts the buried core of the C-td Moreau and King , 2009 . This replacement destabilized the partially folded intermediate in the folding pathway , and induced a concerted unfoldingerefolding mechanism Moreau and King , 2009 . In this study , WT HgD and the two HgD-Crys mutants , I90 F and L5 S were used to investigate the stabilizing effect of citrate on partially unfolded conformations of HgD-Crys . Developing pharmacological agents that can stabilize damaged proteins or slow the aggregation of lens proteins may have a significant impact on public health . It has been estimated that retarding the progress of cataract by ten years may reduce the number of individuals affected by up to 50 percent Livingston et al. , 1995 . Preliminary experiments in vivo suggested that the antioxidant carnosine suppressed radical oxygen species in the lens , and inhibited glycation of lens proteins in diabetic rats Shi et al. , 2009 Yan et al. , 2008 . Topical ocular application of a carnosine derivative , N-acetylcarnosine was used in a study of 75 patients with age-related cataract , which demonstrated that 9 months of treatment increased visual acuity and in some cases cleared cataract from treated eyes Babizhayev et al. , 2009 . Stabilization of proteins by ions in solution has been extensively studied Street et al. , 2006 Tadeo et al. , 2009 . For a number of proteins , the binding of ions has a stabilizing effect Muzammil et al. , 2000 Pace , 1992 Pace and McGrath , 1980 Ramos and Baldwin , 2002 . Structural studies of the molten globule protein a-lactalbumin demonstrated that the binding of a single calcium ion induced a conformational change that stabilized the protein and increased the DG of unfolding by 40 kJ Kronman et al. , 1981 Van Ceunebroeck et al. , 1985 . Subsequent studies demonstrated that sodium , potassium , lithium and magnesium bound to the same site , and also induced a more stable conformation Permyakov and Berliner , 2000 . Similar studies using the enzyme superoxide dis-mutase showed that while zinc binding plays no catalytic role , it is critical to stabilizing flexible loops between the b-strands of the Greek key fold Getzoff et al. , 1989 Parge et al. , 1992 . The bound zinc ion forms a hydrogen-bond network that bridges the active site channel and stabilizes critical charged amino acids in Loop VII Banci et al. , 2003 Parge et al. , 1992 . Recent studies of ancestral members of the bg-crystallin superfamily revealed a common calcium binding motif Aravind et al. , 2009 Barnwal et al. , 2009 . Thermodynamic studies of several members of the crystallin family demonstrated that calcium binding increases stability by bridging the loops which connect the b-strands of the Greek key fold Wenk Jaenicke , 1999 Kretschmar et al. , 1999 . These in vitro studies have demonstrated that ion binding can have a dramatic influence on tertiary structure and protein stability . In the physiological context , these findings suggest that the kinetic intermediates populated on these unfolding and aggregation pathways need to be considered , particularly for b-sheet proteins Roder and Colón , 1997 . Stabilization of kinetic precursors to off-pathway aggregation may slow unfolding and prevent aggregation . Conversely , stabilization of conformations on the aggregation pathway may accelerate aggregation . Elucidation of the mechanism by which ions stabilize crystallin to prevent unfolding may facilitate the development of new therapies that can prevent the progression of cataract . Orally delivered citric acid was shown to slow the progression of cataract in diabetic rats , and also reduce glycation end products in the lenses of treated animals Nagai et al. , 2010 . Recent studies demonstrated that sodium citrate slowed unfolding and aggregation of the protease inhibitor a1-Antitrypsin in vitro , and increased inhibitory activity of the enzyme Bottomley and Tew , 2000 Pearce et al. , 2008 . The enzyme was crystallized in the presence of sodium citrate , and it was found that citrate binds to A and B b-sheets of the protein , a region thought to maintain stability . This result suggests that citrate binding induces stabilization of the protein , which can slow unfolding and prevent aggregation Pearce et al. , 2008 . Sodium citrate was also found to stabilize soluble beta sheet structure of Human gC Crystallin and slow aggregation at low pH Wang et al. , 2010 . The purpose of this work is to further investigate the stabi-lizing effect of sodium citrate and its potential as a small molecule inhibitor of aggregation of Human gD Crystallin HgD-Crys . 2 . Materials and methods 2.1 . Protein expression and purification Plasmids for WT HgD-Crys , L5S HgD-Crys , and I90F HgD-Crys were the generous gift of K.M. N-terminal His-tagged constructs of WT HgD-Crys and I90F HgD-Crys were expressed as described previously Kosinski-Collins et al. , 2004 . Briefly , M15 Escherichia coli was grown at 37 C to an OD600 of 1.0 , and expression was induced with 1 mM IPTG for 4 h . Cells were pelleted and resuspended in lysis buffer 50 mM NaPi , 300 mM NaCl , 18 mM Imidazole , 1 mM EDTA , pH 8.0 and stored at 80 C. L5S HgD-Crys was expressed as described previously Moreau and King , 2009 . M15 E. coli was grown at 37 C to OD600 of 1.0 , then expression was induced overnight at 17 C with 1 mM IPTG . For all HgD-Crys variants , cells were lysed by sonication , and cell debris was pelleted by centrifugation at 20,000 g for 45 min . DNA was precipitated using 0.12 % PEI , followed by centri-fugation at 20,000 g for 10 min . Supernatant was filtered and loaded onto a Ni-NTA Qiagen affinity column , and purified using an AKTA fast protein liquid chromatography system GE Healthcare by eluting the HgD-Crys using a linear gradient of imidazole from 0 to 100 % . Fractions containing pure HgD-Crys were pooled and dialyzed in 10 mM ammonium acetate , pH 7.0 . 2.2 . Equilibrium unfoldingerefolding Equilibrium unfoldingerefolding experiments were performed as previously described Flaugh et al. , 2006 . Buffers were prepared as appropriate , adjusted to pH 7.0 , and then filtered . The unfol-dingerefolding curves were fit to a two-state Greene and Pace , 1974 or three-state model Clark et al. , 1993 using Kaleidagraph Synergy Software . Increase in fluorescence intensity due to light-scattering at low concentrations of GuHCl in refolding samples were not included in data used to fit refolding curves . Average and standard deviations of transition midpoint , DG0 , and m-values were calculated using three separate trials . 2.3 . Unfolding kinetics Unfolding kinetics were performed as previously described Moreau and King , 2009 . Briefly , WT HgD-Crys was diluted into unfolding buffer 5.5 M GuHCl , 100 mM NaPi , 5 mM DTT , 1 mM EDTA , pH 7.0 at 18 C for a final protein concentration of 10 mg ml . The concentration of GuHCl was reduced to 3.5 M GuHCl in unfolding buffer for mutant HgD-Crys . In citrate samples , 250 mM sodium citrate was added to unfolding buffer . Excitation wave-length was set to 295 nm , and fluorescence emission at 350 nm was measured over time using a Hitachi F-4500 fluorimeter . Kinetic unfolding data were fit to single or double exponentials using Kaleidagraph Synergy Software . Best fits were chosen based on random distribution of fit residuals , and agreement of parameters with previous results Moreau and King , 2009 . Experiments were performed in triplicate for each condition , and fit parameters for the three trials were averaged . 2.4 . Refolding kinetics WT , I90F and L5S HgD-Crys were unfolded in buffer containing 5.5 M GuHCl , 100 mM NaPi , 5 mM DTT , 1 mM EDTA , pH 7.0 , at 37 C Table 1 Kinetic unfolding at a concentration of 100 mg ml for 5 h . Citrate samples were unfolded under identical conditions with the addition of 250 mM sodium citrate in the unfolding buffer . Samples were diluted to 10 mg ml into refolding buffer containing 1 M GuHCl , 100 mM NaPi , 5 mM DTT , 1 mM EDTA , pH 7.0 , at 37 C , and citrate samples were diluted into refolding buffer containing 250 mM sodium citrate . Excitation wavelength was set to 295 nm , and fluorescence emis-sion at 350 nm was measured over time using a Hitachi F-4500 fluorimeter . Kinetic refolding data was fit to single or double exponentials using Kaleidagraph Synergy Software . At high concentrations of sodium citrate , long-lived intermediates pre-vented the fitting of the data with a double exponential . In these cases , the discrete transitions were estimated , then fit separately with single exponential equations . Best fits were chosen based on random distribution of fit residuals , and agreement of parameters with previous results Moreau and King , 2009 . Experiments were performed in triplicate for each condition , and fit parameters for the three trials were averaged . 2.5 . Aggregation turbidity Aggregation experiments were performed as described previ-ously Knee et al. , 2011 Acosta-Sampson and King , 2010 WT , L5S and I90F HgD-Crys were incubated in unfolding buffer 5.5 M GuHCl , 100 mM NaPi 1 mM EDTA , 5 mM DTT for 16 h at 37 C at a concentration of 0.5 mg ml in the presence and absence of stabilizing anions . Unfolded protein was then rapidly diluted ten-fold into buffer 100 mM NaPi , 1 mM EDTA , 5 mM DTT at 37 C in the presence and absence of stabilizing anions for a final protein concentration of 50 mg ml . Solution turbidity was measured by apparent absorbance at 350 nm using a Cary 50 UV Vis Spectro-photometer Varian . 3 . Results The unfoldingerefolding pathway of WT HgD-Crys follows a three-state folding pathway , and populates a meta-stable inter-mediate consisting of an unfolded N-td and a folded C-td Flaugh et al. , 2005a Kosinski-Collins et al. , 2004 Kosinski-Collins and King , 2003 Mills et al. , 2007 . When either 100 mM sodium phosphate or 100 mM sodium phosphate and 250 mM sodium citrate was included in the buffer , the characteristic three-state transition of HgD-Crys was observed . In the presence of 100 mM sodium phosphate , the N-td had an unfolding midpoint of 2.2 0.1 M GuHCl , and the C-td had an unfolding midpoint of 2.8 0.1 M GuHCl Table 1 , values consistent with previous reports Kosinski-Collins et al. , 2004 . In the presence of 250 mM sodium citrate both of the unfolding midpoints increased , from 2.2 0.1 to 2.5 0.1 M GuHCl for the N-td and from 2.8 0.1 to 3.4 0.1 M Equilibrium unfolding GuHCl for the C-td Fig. 1 , Table 1 . Sodium citrate increased the DG of unfolding of WT HgD-Crys from 16.6 kcal mol to 22.2 kcal mol Table 1 . In these unfoldingerefolding experiments , the ionic strength of the sample is dominated by the high concentration of GuHCl . The observed effect of the citrate ion must be through specific interactions with the protein or the solvent . Though not as effective as sodium citrate , increased stability was also observed for other kosmotropic anions in the Hofmeister series Zhang and Cremer , 2010 , including sodium phosphate and sodium sulfate data not shown . The stabilizing effect of the sodium citrate on the unfolding of HgD-Crys was further examined by varying the concentration of sodium citrate the stability of each domain increased linearly with increasing concentration of sodium citrate , but the effect was more pronounced in the C-td than in the N-td Fig. 2 , Table 1 . The presence of sodium citrate had a greater effect on the C-td of WT HgD-Crys as shown by the 0.6 M GuHCl increase in the unfolding midpoint in the presence of sodium citrate , as compared to 0.3 M GuHCl increase observed for the N-td . The kinetic unfolding of WT HgD-Crys was also measured in the presence and absence of sodium citrate . Previous studies have established that HgD-Crys has a 3 state unfolding pathway , in which the N-td unfolds , followed by the C-td Kosinski-Collins and King , 2003 Mills et al. , 2007 . In 100 mM sodium phosphate buffer , the N-td unfolded with a half-time of 900 60 s , followed by the Fig. 3 . Kinetic unfolding of WT HgD-Crys . Sample was rapidly diluted into unfolding buffer containing 5 M GuHCl in the absence -and presence of 250 mM sodium citrate . more stable C-td , which unfolded with a half-time of 6000 300 s , consistent with previous reports Moreau and King , 2009 . When 250 mM sodium citrate was added to the buffer , no change was observed in the unfolding kinetics . In the presence of 250 mM Table 2 Equilibrium unfolding Kinetic unfolding sodium citrate , the N-td unfolded with a half-time of 910 90 s , and C-td unfolded with a half-time of 6500 900 s . This result suggests that citrate does not act by stabilizing the native state , but more likely by an effect on a partially folded intermediate . 3.2 . Stabilization of N-terminal domain mutant L5S HgD-Crys Previous work extensively characterized the thermodynamic properties of the congenital cataract associated mutant L5S , which has a destabilized N-td , but an unaffected C-td Moreau and King , 2009 . The unfolding of L5S HgD-Crys creates a long-lived folding intermediate consisting of an unfolded N-td and a folded C-td , as evidenced by a plateau in the equilibrium unfoldingerefolding curves from 1 M to 2.3 M GuHCl Fig. 4 . When L5S HgD-Crys was equilibrated with 250 mM sodium citrate , the stabilizing effect was of similar magnitude to the effect observed for WT HgD-Crys . In the presence of 250 mM sodium citrate , the unfolding midpoint of the N-td was increased by 0.3 M GuHCl , from 0.7 0.1 M GuHCl , to 1.0 0.1 M GuHCl , and the unfolding midpoint of the C-td was increased by 0.6 M GuHCl from 2.8 0.1 M GuHCl to 3.4 0.1 M GuHCl Fig. 4 , Table 2 . For kinetic unfolding experiments , the destabilization caused by the mutation necessitated a change in the concentration of dena-turant from 5.5 M to 3.5 M GuHCl , in order to more accurately observe the rapid unfolding of the N-td . Dilution of L5S HgD-Crys into 100 mM sodium phosphate unfolding buffer resulted in rapid unfolding of the destabilized N-td with a half-time of 1.5 0.2 s , which is in agreement with previous reports Moreau and King , 2009 . The addition of 250 mM sodium citrate to the unfolding buffer resulted in a half-time of unfolding of the N-td of 1.9 0.1 s Fig. 5 , Table 2 . Thus , the presence of citrate did not appreciably slow the rate of unfolding of the N-td . As a result of the low concentration of denaturant used in the experiment , the C-td did not fully unfold , and therefore no observations could be made concerning the unfolding of the C-td of L5S HgD-Crys . These kinetic unfolding results are consistent with those found for wild-type , suggesting that citrate does not act by stabilizing the native state . 3.3 . Stabilization of C-terminal mutant I90F HgD-Crys Previous studies demonstrated that the cataract associated I90F mutation in the C-td eliminates the intermediate in the folding pathway and induces a two-state concerted unfolding mechanism Moreau and King , 2009 . Equilibrium unfoldingerefolding exper-iments indicated that in the presence of 100 mM sodium phos-phate , the unfolding midpoint of I90F HgD-Crys was 1.7 0.1 M GuHCl . In the presence of 250 mM sodium citrate , the unfolding midpoint was increased by 0.4 M GuHCl to 2.1 0.1 M GuHCl Fig. 6 , Table 3 . In the presence of citrate , the increase in stability of the two-state unfolding midpoint of I90F HgD-Crys was larger than the increase in stability of the N-td of WT HgD-Crys , but smaller than k1 Fig. 5 . Kinetic Unfolding of the N-td of L5S HgD-Crys . Sample was rapidly diluted into unfolding buffer containing 3.5 M GuHCl in the absence C and presence of 250 mM sodium citrate . the increase in stability of the C-td of WT HgD-Crys . This may be the result of conformational change in the C-td caused by perturbation of the hydrophobic core of I90F HgD-Crys . In the presence of 100 mM sodium phosphate , I90F HgD-Crys was observed to unfold with a half-time of 380 20 s Fig. 7 , in agreement with previously published results Moreau and King , 2009 . When 250 mM sodium citrate was added , a folding inter-mediate appeared in the unfolding pathway , which was not apparent in the absence of citrate . In the presence of 250 mM sodium citrate , the first transition has a half-time of 173 4 s , while the second transition has a half-time of 2600 200 s Fig. 7 , Table 3 . Sequential unfolding of the N-td and C-td was previously observed in kinetic unfolding studies of WT HgD , therefore , it is likely that the two transitions observed for I90F HgD unfolding in the presence of sodium citrate can be attributed to the unfolding of N-td and C-td Kosinski-Collins and King , 2003 Mills et al. , 2007 . 3.4 . Sodium citrate slows aggregation of mutant HgD-Crys When HgD is rapidly diluted from high to low denaturant concentration , the proteins do not spontaneously refold to a native state , but rather associate into amorphous aggregates . The rate of aggregation of HgD-Crys can be measured in vitro by solution turbidity , and can be used to quantify the effects of small mole-cules on the HgD-Crys aggregation pathway . WT , L5S , and I90F HgD-Crys were rapidly diluted from 5.5 M GuHCl to 0.55 M GuHCl , in the presence and absence of 250 mM sodium citrate , and the rate of aggregation was measured . For WT HgD-Crys , an aggre-gation rate of 45 5 s was observed in 100 mM sodium phos-phate , and a rate of 50 10 s was observed in the presence of 250 mM sodium citrate Table 4 . These rates are consistent with previously published aggregation rates for HgD-Crys Knee et al. , 2011 and indicate that sodium citrate had little effect on the aggregation of WT HgD-Crys , a result similar to that seen in the kinetic unfolding experiments . For the N-td mutant L5S HgD-Crys , an aggregation rate of 21 1 s was observed for 100 mM sodium phosphate . However , in the presence of 250 mM sodium citrate , the aggregation rate was slowed by 120 % , to 46 6 s Table 4 . The decreased rate suggests that the presence of the sodium citrate is influencing the aggre-gation of L5S HgD-Crys to a greater degree than WT HgD-Crys . The Table 3 Thermodynamic parameters for equilibrium unfolding refolding and kinetic unfolding of I90F HgD-Crys .

Table 4 Half-time of aggregation for HgD-Crys . largest effect of sodium citrate on aggregation rate was seen with the C-td mutant I90F HgD-Crys . In 100 mM sodium phosphate , the rate of I90F HgD-Crys aggregation was 34 5 s , while in the presence of 250 mM sodium citrate , the rate of aggregation was slowed by 135 % , to 80 10 s Table 4 , the slowest rate of aggre-gation for all three HgD variants used in this study . This result mirrors what was observed for the unfolding kinetics , in which the presence of the sodium citrate had the largest effect on the kinetic unfolding of I90F HgD-Crys . 3.5 . Sodium citrate slows HgD crystallin refolding Previous reports have demonstrated that refolding of HgD-Crys begins with the folding of the C-td , followed by the folding of the N-td , passing through an intermediate likely consisting of a folded C-td and an unfolded N-td Das et al. , 2010 Kosinski-Collins and King , 2003 Mills et al. , 2007 . Rapid dilution of HgD-Crys into buffer containing varying amounts of sodium citrate initiated the refolding reaction . In phosphate buffer , the C-terminal domain of WT HgD-Crys refolded with a half-time of 10.9 0.2 s , and the N-terminal domain refolds with a half-time of 60 4 s Fig. 8 , Table 5 , consistent with previous reports Kosinski-Collins and Table 5 Rate of kinetic refolding of HgD-Crys . WT HgD-Crys King , 2003 Mills et al. , 2007 . When refolded in the presence of 250 mM sodium citrate , an additional intermediate was observed in WT HgD-Crys . Initial collapse of the protein structure occurred with a half-time of 130 3 s , which populated a stable interme-diate . Following the formation of the stable intermediate , WT HgD-Crys followed a three-state folding pathway beginning with refolding of the C-td with a half-time of 600 100 s , followed by refolding of the N-td with a half-time of 8000 1000 s Fig. 8 , Table 5 . These results suggest that citrate interacts with and stabilizes a partially folded intermediate , thus retarding the rate of refolding . In refolding studies of L5S HgD-Crys , the N-td of L5S HgD-Crys , which was significantly destabilized in equilibrium unfolding-refolding studies , refolded with a half-time of 1970 280 s , thirty-three times slower than the rate of refolding of WT HgD-Crys N-td Fig. 8 , Table 5 . On the other hand , the C-td refolded on a similar time scale to WT HgD-Crys , with a half-time of 14.2 0.7 s Fig. 8 , Table 5 , further demonstrating that the N-td mutation has no effect on the folding and stability of the C-td . In refolding studies of L5S HgD-Crys in the presence of 250 mM sodium citrate , the lag phase observed in the refolding of WT HgD-Crys was no longer present , and the C-td refolds rapidly with a half-time 39 2 s Fig. 8 , Table 5 . Folding of the N-td follows with a half-time of 1630 60 s . The decreased stability of the N-terminal domain of L5S HgD slowed the refolding , which influences the populations of intermediate conformations in the folding pathway . As a result , citrate may interact differently with these intermediates than those which dominate the folding pathway of WT HgD-Crys . In the case of I90F HgD-Crys , in which both the C-td and N-td are destabilized , kinetic refolding was slower when compared to WT HgD-Crys . In phosphate buffer , the C-td of I90F HgD-Crys refolded with a half-time 55.2 0.6 s Fig. 8 , Table 5 , five times slower than the refolding of the C-td of WT HgD-Crys . The N-td of I90F HgD-Crys refolded with a half-time of 2200 200 s in Fig. 8 , Table 5 , over thirtytimesslowerthantherefoldingof theN-tdinWT HgD-Crys.In the presence of 250 mM sodium citrate , the refolding of I90F HgD-Crys was further slowed when compared to refolding in phosphate . After an initial lag phase , the C-td refolded with a half-time of 540 10 s Fig. 8 , Table 5 , and the N-td followed with a half-time of 5700 600 s Fig. 8 , Table 5 . Kinetic and equilibrium results indi-cate that the interaction of citrate is strongest when the buried hydrophobic core of the protein is exposed , and this interaction can interfere with the folding pathway of all three HgD-Crys variants . 4 . Discussion Numerous studies on the interaction of proteins with ions in solution have demonstrated that cosolutes are critical to main-taining protein solubility and stability Busby et al. , 1981 Ramos k3 and Baldwin , 2002 Tadeo et al. , 2009 . In this study , equilibrium unfolding-refolding results with WT HgD-Crys demonstrated that the presence of sodium citrate increased protein stability . The free energy of unfolding increased 5.6 kcal mol in the presence of sodium citrate , which is similar to the increase in DG of unfolding of Ribonuclease A in the presence of 200 mM sodium sulfate Ramos and Baldwin , 2002 . The presence of sodium sulfate has also been shown to increase the thermal stability of immunoglobulin light chain , increasing the Tm from 46.1 C to 59.3 C Sikkink and Ramirez-Alvarado , 2008 . A comprehensive study of protein stability in the presence of salt demonstrated that a specific inter-action with neutral salts increased the stability of Ribonuclease A in a linear manner as measured by thermal unfolding Von Hippel and Wong , 1965 . Despite the increase in protein stability observed in equilibrium unfoldingerefolding studies , the presence of sodium citrate had no effect on the rate of kinetic unfolding of WT and L5S HgD-Crys . However , the presence of citrate did have an effect on the kinetic unfolding of I90F HgD-Crys . In the presence of citrate , unfolding of the mutant was slowed significantly , and a kinetic intermediate was observed that was not observed in the absence of citrate Fig. 7 . Kinetic analysis of the folding and unfolding of I90F HgD-Crys reveal that the lifetimes and rates of the mutant intermediates differ from that of the wild-type Figs . 3 , 5 , 7 , and 8 Moreau and King , 2009 . It is also reasonable to infer that the conformation of the mutant intermediates differs from that of the wild-type . We propose that the kinetic unfolding data demonstrate that the I90F mutant has a longer-lived conformation accessible to citrate binding . The I90F mutation destabilizes the hydrophobic core of HgD-Crys , leading to increased solvent exposure . I90F HgD-Crys is the most destabilized of the three HgD-Crys proteins studied , and thus it is reasonable that the sodium citrate would have the strongest stabilizing effect . Simulations by Das et al. show that folding of WT HgD-Crys is nucleated by the A and B strands in motif 4 of the C-td , which is stabilized by a non-native salt bridge between Q135 and R142 Das et al. , 2010 . Citrate stabilization of these critical char-geecharge interactions may play a role in slowing the unfolding of the perturbed hydrophobic core of the C-td of I90F HgD-Crys . A systematic study of surface mutants of Protein L from Strepto-coccus magnus demonstrated that an increase in solvent-exposed surface area increases the stabilization effect of solvated ions Tadeo et al. , 2009 . Furthermore , studies have shown that the presence of sodium citrate slowed the unfolding of a1-Antitrypsin by direct binding Pearce et al. , 2008 . These results indicate that citrate can bind directly to b-strands , thereby stabilizing the protein and slowing the unfolding . To better understand the interaction of sodium citrate with folding intermediates , kinetic refolding of HgD-Crys was studied in the presence and absence of sodium citrate . In kinetic unfolding studies of WT and L5S HgD-Crys , presence of citrate showed no effect on the rate of unfolding . However , in the presence of citrate , the refolding kinetics of both WT and L5S HgD-Crys slowed dramatically . This suggests that citrate stabilizes partially folded intermediates in the folding pathway , which slows progress to the native state . A similar slowing of the refolding kinetics of I90F HgD-Crys is observed , further indicating that citrate interacts with partially folded conformations . In aggregation experiments in this study , sodium citrate demonstrated negligible effect on rate of aggregation of WT HgD-Crys , but adding 250 mM sodium citrate considerably slows the rate of aggregation of both L5S HgD-Crys and I90F HgD-Crys . Similar results were reported in studies of a1-Antitrypsin , which showed that the presence of sodium citrate slowed aggregation in vitro Bottomley and Tew , 2000 Pearce et al. , 2008 . These results suggest that citrate may slow the rate of aggregation of destabilized or damaged proteins by stabilizing partially unfolded conformations . If we assume that the precursor conformer in aggregation is derived from the partially unfolded intermediate on the productive pathway , then stabilizationofpartiallyunfoldedintermediateswouldslowthe rate of unfolding and aggregation . A second possibility is that citrate acts directly to inhibit the aggregation reaction without interacting with the productive intermediate . Recent studies have shown that moleculeswhich donot interact stronglywith theproteinin solution can slow aggregation by increasing the energy required to exclude the solvent from hydrophobic interactions in the aggregated state Schneider and Trout , 2009 Vagenende et al. , 2009 . There are two different mechanisms which may explain the observed stabilization of HgD-Crys by citrate a global stabilization via the Hofmeister effect , or direct ion binding . Computational models suggest that solvated ions can stabilize native protein structure by increasing surface tension surrounding aliphatic side chains , and stabilizing the surface charge interaction by polarizing the first hydration shell of the protein Baldwin , 1996 Dill et al. , 2005 Ramos and Baldwin , 2002 Tadeo et al. , 2009 . These effects can combine to shift equilibrium to favor the folded state by stabilizing both surface charge interaction and hydrophobic inter-action between aliphatic side chains without direct ion binding . However , the domain-specific effect of citrate stabilization of HgD-Crys is not completely explained by the Hofmeister effect . In equilibrium unfoldingerefolding studies of both WT and L5S HgD-Crys , the C-td was stabilized to a much higher degree than the N-td , suggesting that citrate preferentially interacts with the C-td . The presence of 250 mM sodium citrate had the same effect on the N-td of WT HgD-Crys as on the N-td of L5S HgD-Crys , which is signifi-cantly destabilized Tables 1 and 2 . The presence of sodium citrate increased the stability of the N-td of L5S HgD-Crys by 0.3 M GuHCl , and the C-td by 0.6 M GuHCl , the same effect as observed in WT HgD-Crys . This difference may be attributed to the increased dipole moment of the C-td , resulting in chargeecharge interactions between the C-td and citrate anions Purkiss et al. , 2007 , but direct binding of citrate to a partially unfolded conformation of the C-td can not be excluded . Studies of the effect of ions on the equilibrium unfoldingerefolding of human serum albumin HSA show that the first transition in unfolding of HSA is stabilized in the presence of 1 M potassium chloride , while the second transition remains unaffected Muzammil et al. , 2000 . Muzammil et al. attribute this stabilization effect to a direct binding of the ion to the protein , rather than interaction at proteinewater interface . Protein stabili-zation by sodium citrate was also observed in equilibrium unfold-ing studies of a1-Antitrypsin , and these studies concluded that the effect was the result of binding of citrate in the turn between strand A and B , a region of the protein known for importance to stability Pearce et al. , 2008 . Our studies on the effect of sodium citrate on HgD-Crys demonstrate that the presence of an anion can have a profound influence on both the stability of protein in solution and the intermediate conformations along the folding and unfolding pathways . Structural studies of a1-antitrypsin show that citrate can bind in the turn between two b-strands , which suggests that citrate may stabilize other b-sheet proteins in a similar manner Bottomley and Tew , 2000 Pearce et al. , 2008 . Evolutionary studies of the bg-crystallin superfamily have demonstrated that members of this family are known to bind ions , which stabilize tertiary structure Aravind et al. , 2009 Barnwal et al. , 2009 . Comparative analysis of protein ion binding sites revealed that ions bind tightly to charged amino acids buried within a hydrophobic shell Yamashita et al. , 1990 . The hydrophobic interface of HgD-Crys contains a number of glutamine residues , and it is possible that citrate binds to these residues at the interface between the N-td and the C-td . Citrate may also bind to charged residues that are exposed in kinetic interme-diates of HgD-Crys folding Das et al. , 2010 Flaugh et al. , 2005b , 2006 . Alternatively , many studies have demonstrated that solvated ions can strengthen hydrophobic interactions in the native state via the Hofmeister effect Ramos and Baldwin , 2002 Zhang and Cremer , 2006 . Slowing the progression of cataract by preventing the formation of light-scattering aggregates is an important public health concern as life expectancy increases and the average age of the world pop-ulation rises Abraham et al. , 2006 . In a recently proposed model of cataract formation , damage to the Crystallins accumulates over time , inducing partially unfolded conformations which aggregate and scatter light Acosta-Sampson and King , 2010 . These results demonstrate that citrate may slow the unfolding of damaged or partially unfolded conformations by stabilizing interactions of buried resides that are exposed to the solvent . The stabilizing effect of sodium citrate on the unfolding of HgD-Crys may have implica-tions for individuals who are at risk of developing cataract .

Episcleral venous pressure and aqueous humor dynamics Dr. Carl Camras spent much of his professional career studying aqueous humor dynamics and ways of modifying intraocular pressure to treat glaucoma , a complex multifactorial disease and a leading cause of vision loss and blindness . Treatment of glaucoma continues to be focused on the reduction of intraocular pressure IOP , which is currently the only modifiable risk factor Weinreb and Khaw , 2004 . Dr. Camras had a particular interest in prosta-glandin analogs , drugs that reduce IOP by increasing the outflow of aqueous humor through the uveoscleral tissues Johnson et al. , 2010 Toris et al. , 2004 , 2007 . To determine uveoscleral flow in many of his studies , Dr. Camras either measured or assumed a specific episcleral venous pressure EVP . EVP measurement is not trivial , and this paper will review some of the challenges Dr. Camras and others have encountered as they explored the effects of pros-taglandin analogs on aqueous humor dynamics and their action in reducing IOP . IOP is dynamic and determined by several variables . The rela-tionship between IOP and these variables can be modeled by the modified Goldmann equation IOP ? EVP ? ? Q U ? c 1 where EVP is the episcleral venous pressure , Q is the aqueous humor flow rate , c is the conventional outflow facility , and U is the pressure-insensitive uveoscleral outflow rate . IOP can be thought of as the pressure required to move aqueous humor out of the eye through the resistance of the trabecular meshwork 1 c and against the pressure in the episcleral veins . EVP can be described as a back-pressure against which aqueous humor must flow , and is a direct determinant of IOP . Measurement of EVP is important to our understanding of uveoscleral flow , a variable that can not be measured non-invasively . In humans , uveoscleral flow must be calculated from the Goldmann equation and the other four variables . Accurate assessment of EVP is necessary , because small errors in EVP can cause much larger errors in the estimate of uveoscleral flow . Consider an example where IOP ? 18 mmHg , Q ? 2.3 mL min , c ? 0.22 mL min mmHg , and EVP is 9 mmHg . By rearranging equation 1 , the uveoscleral outflow is 0.32 ml min , or 14 % of total aqueous humor outflow . If EVP were erroneously estimated to be 10 mmHg an 11 % error , the estimate of uveoscleral outflow rate would be 0.54 mL min , or 23 % of total aqueous humor outflow , an overestimate of uveoscleral flow by 69 % . Clearly , accurate and reproducible measurements of EVP are critical to understanding aqueous humor dynamics and neces-sary for understanding physiologic principles that determine IOP and its variation over the circadian cycle . As well , accurate measurement of EVP and calculation of uveoscleral flow rate provide an understanding of several glaucoma therapies and may provide a basis for developing new therapies to reduce IOP . 2 . Physiology of the episcleral vascular system The distal outflow system between Schlemm’s canal and the episcleral vasculature was first described by Ascher in the 1940s Ascher , 1942 . Ascher noted that aqueous humor from Schlemm’s canal exited through collector channels that drained into vessels devoid of blood , which he termed aqueous veins . These vessels subsequently merged and drained into episcleral veins . One of the key characteristics of the vessels at these anastomoses was laminar flow , which hedescribedas “stratifiedcurrent , ” withparallelstreams of aqueous humor and blood visible in the vessel Ascher , 1942 . Compression of the episcleral vein distal to an anastomosis produced two phenomena Ascher , 1942 . In some cases , the aqueous vein would fill with blood , indicating that the pressure or fluid velocity in the recipient vessel was higher than in the aqueous vein , while in other cases , the recipient vessel would fill with clear aqueous humor , indicating that the pressure or velocity in the recipient vessel was lower than in the aqueous vein . This dynamic behavior indicated that compression of the episcleral vein could alter the pressure profile along the vein . Whether or not EVP is actively regulated is still unclear , although the anatomy of the distal outflow system is consistent with a vascular system capable of pressure regulation . The epis-cleral vasculature consists of arteries , veins , and arteriovenous anastomoses , with significant variation in the anatomy of the vessels draining Schlemm’s canal Ashton , 1951 , 1952 Ashton and Smith , 1953 . One possible mechanism for the regulation of EVP is the direct modulation of vascular resistance in the episcleral venous system . According to Grant and others Ellingsen and Grant , 1972 Grant , 1958 Rosenquist et al. , 1989 approximately 25 % , and perhaps as much as 50 % , of outflow resistance resides distal to Schlemm’s canal . However , calculations of the outflow resistance based on histological measurements of collector channels and aqueous veins suggest that passive distal outflow resistance is negligible . A variation in the caliber of these channels and the episcleral vasculature might explain their resistance episcleral vessels , including the veins , stain intensely for smooth-muscle a-actin , Selbach et al. , 2005b which suggests the presence of muscular walls . Relatively small changes in vascular tone may result in venous constriction that increases fluid resistance and EVP . Dynamic modulation of connections between the arterial and venous vessels might also adjust EVP . There are relatively few capillaries between the arterial and venous segments except in the limbal region Gaasterland et al. , 1970 Selbach et al. , 1998 where episcleral arteries and veins connect through a network of anasto-moses that are innervated Selbach et al. , 2005b . The identification of neurotransmitters in this tissue suggested that the vascular plexus was under neural control . Modulation of the arteriovenous connections , possibly through nitric oxide signaling , could modu-late EVP by controlling the degree to which the episcleral venous system is exposed to the higher pressure arterial system . This mechanism has been supported by the work of Funk et al. 1996 who found that topical administration of a vasodilator and nitric oxide donor nitroprusside increased EVP in rabbits . Recently Table 1 Zamora and Kiel 2010 further investigated the effects of nitric oxide and confirmed that topical nitroprusside increased EVP , and demonstrated that a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor N-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester reduced EVP . These results suggest that vasodilation of the episcleral arteriovenous anastomoses , mediated by nitric oxide , increase EVP . Importantly , IOP also changed as EVP changed . Whether or not a similar mechanism exists in humans is unknown . Zamora and Kiel 2009 also noted that a topical anesthetic proparacaine decreased EVP in experimental animals . They sug-gested that the anesthetic blocked efferent neural inputs in the episcleral vasculature and decreased EVP through the mechanism discussed above , further evidence for neural control of resistance . A sensitivity of EVP to anesthesia affects glaucoma management because IOP is usually measured after topical anesthesia . If topical anesthetics indeed affect EVP , then the IOP measured after topical anesthesia may not reflect the IOP at other times . 3 . Techniques for EVP measurement Assessment and understanding of physiologic properties of EVP , including its neuralcontrol in humans , requires methods foraccurate and precise EVP measurement , and our incomplete understanding of EVP is a result of the difficulty of its measurement . EVP can be measured by using two approaches , invasive and non-invasive . Invasive methods are more accurate , but can not be used in humans . Non-invasive measurements are typically easier and are suitable for human use , but may be subject to measurement biases . Withbothapproaches , the measurementprocessitselfcanaffectEVP . 3.1 . Invasive measurement of EVP EVP has been measured invasively by direct cannulation of episcleral veins and indirectly by controlling the pressure in the anterior chamber Table 1 . Direct cannulation entails measuring pressure through a cannula inserted into an episcleral vein , a vessel that has a diameter of 50e100 mm in humans and smaller in animal models . Two approaches have been used to measure EVP by can-nulation 1 use of plastic tubing that occludes the lumen of the vessel , and 2 use of glass pipettes drawn to a 2-to 5-mm tip diameter that minimally disturbs flow through the vessel . The use of large cannulas that occlude the lumen Brubaker , 1967 Gaasterland and Pederson , 1983 Linner , 1949 minimizes the effects of fluid viscosity as fluid moves between the cannula and the vessel . However , the direction of cannula placement relative to flow in the vessel can affect the measurement . For example , if the opening of the cannula is placed facing the flow so fluid is forced into the cannula , the EVP can be overestimated Brubaker , 1967 . Accurate measurement of EVP requires that the cannula face downstream , provided that there are sufficient anastomoses to prevent a significant decrease in vascular fluid volume after the cannula occludes the vessel . Smaller glass pipettes tip diameters between 2 and 5 mm have the advantage of minimally affecting pressure within the episcleral vein , but are technically more diffi-cult to use Zamora and Kiel , 2009 , 2010 . The small diameter and the low volume of fluid in the vessel preclude direct measurement by a pressure transducer through the cannula . Instead , Brubaker Brubaker , 1967 used a “zero-flow” technique pressure in the cannula was adjusted by using a manometer until fluid stopped moving through the cannula in either direction . At that point , the boundary between the blood in the vein and the perfusion fluid oscillated with the cardiac pulse , indicating that the pressure set by the manometer was equal to average venous pressure . Other investigators have used the servo-null technique adapted from microvascular measurements in other organs Maepea and Bill , 1989 Reitsamer and Kiel , 2002 . With this method , a fast piezoelectric valve connected to positive and nega-tive air pressure sources is used to adjust the pressure in a micro-pipette that is filled with fluid of different electrical resistance than serum . When the pressure inside the pipette differs from pressure in the vein just outside the tip , the fluid moves either into or out of the pipette , changing the electrical resistance of the pipette . The valve pressure is then adjusted until the fluid within the micropi-pette tip , and its resistance , returns to the null position indicating equilibrium with the vascular pressure Avila et al. , 2001 . With smaller animals , such as mice , this direct method is diffi-cult because of the small size of the episcleral veins . An alternate , indirect measurement technique was developed by Aihara et al. 2002 and Aihara et al. 2003 . Pressure in the anterior chamber was controlled through a glass intracameral needle connected to a water-filled reservoir and pressure transducer . The investigators gradually reduced the intracameral pressure until blood refluxed into the collector channels and Schlemm’s canal , and the pressure that allowed blood to reflux was assumed to be equal to the EVP . 3.2 . Non-invasive measurement of EVP Non-invasive measurement of EVP is based on the principle of venous compression . An episcleral vein is identified , a force is applied to the vein until it collapses , and venous pressure is determined from the pressure required to collapse the vessel to a predetermined endpoint . 3.2.1 . Pressure chamber technique The most common method for non-invasive EVP measurement involves the use of a clear flexible membrane attached to a pressure chamber to apply a force sufficient to collapse an episcleral vein . A wide variety of membrane materials have been used in various devices , including latex Phelps and Armaly , 1978 , serosal membrane Weigelin and Lohlein , 1952 , frog pericardium Brubaker , 1967 , and silicone rubber Zeimer et al. , 1983 . In all cases , the membrane was placed against the surface of an episcleral vein , the pressure in the chamber was gradually increased , and when the vein collapsed , the pressure in the chamber was assumed to be equal to the venous pressure . Vessels do not collapse instantaneously , but collapse gradually over a range of several mmHg of applied pressure . The critical measurement endpoint of collapse has usually been assumed to be between baseline , when the pressure in the chamber is equal to atmospheric pressure , and total collapse of the vein . However , this endpoint has been deter-mined by direct observation and is subjective . As a result , the measurement of EVP can be variable and uncertain . The endpoint that provides the best estimate of EVP has been an ongoing point of discussion concerning these measurements . Bru-baker compared EVP measured by using the pressure chamber technique to EVP measured invasively by using episcleral vein cannulation in rabbits Brubaker , 1967 . He obtained similar results with the two techniques when he used a subjective endpoint for the pressure chamber method defined as “the point at which some portion of the preselected vessel collapsed.” Gaasterland and Pederson 1983 compared EVP measured by using the pressure chamber technique with pressures determined by cannulation in rhesus monkeys . They found that pressing the pressure chamber membrane to the sclera affected the EVP being measured , and increasing the pressure produced a 3-phase response . Initially , cannulation pressure increased minimally as the membrane pres-sure increased , but no vein collapse was visible . As indentation of the vein became obvious with increasing membrane pressure , the cannulation pressure rose rapidly , and as the vein approached complete collapse , the change in cannulation pressure again stabilized . They concluded that the smallest detectable collapse was associated with the pressure closest to the true initial cannu-lation pressure , while later endpoints overestimated EVP . Despite its limitations , the pressure chamber technique is the only method for non-invasive measurement of EVP that can be used with a commercially available device Episcleral Venom-anometer , Model EV-310 , EyeTech Ltd , Morton Grove , IL . This device Fig.1 consists of a clear flexible tip that contacts the surface of the eye while the episcleral vein of interest is viewed through the clear membrane . The tip is connected to an air chamber with a piston that compresses the air , and a dial adjusts pressure in the chamber . The dial is calibrated in mmHg so that the pressure can be read directly . This device is essentially unchanged since it was first developed by Zeimer et al. 1983 and requires a subjective judgment of the endpoint . In their original work , Zeimer et al. recommended observing when the vein was “half-blanched , ” although this endpoint is subject to different interpretation by various users . Because of this lack of a definite endpoint , EVP measurements have been highly variable , and studies that used the device have repor-ted a wide range of normal human EVPs that are difficult to compare and interpret Sultan and Blondeau , 2003 Toris et al. , 1999 Zeimer et al. , 1983 . In addition , the user can sense how much the dial is being turned . This tactile sense of EVP presents a temptation to set the dial to the expected pressure . Combined with the lack of a definitive endpoint , measurements of EVP with this device can potentially be biased . 3.2.2 . Other non-invasive measurement techniques EVP has also been measured non-invasively by using other methods that measure the force required to collapse an episcleral vein . With the torsion balance method Brubaker , 1967 Linner et al. , 1950 , a clear plastic applanation tip was connected to a torsion spring via a lever arm similar to a Goldmann applanation tonometer . The applanation tip was placed against an episcleral vein and viewed through a slit-lamp , and the force applied by the tip against the surface of the eye was increased by turning a dial until the episcleral vein collapsed . Because the area of the tip was fixed , pressure could be calculated from the force applied , and this was assumed to be equivalent to EVP . Podos et al. 1968 developed a modification of this technique , by using a joystick to adjust the device position and a force-displacement transducer to measure force automatically . Krakau et al. 1973 developed an alternate method in which the force to compress an episcleral vein was applied to the surface of the eye by a jet of air . As with the pressure chamber technique , the air flow required to collapse the episcleral vein was correlated with the EVP . Each of these techniques required subjective endpoints similar to those of the pressure chamber technique . In addition , the air jet method assumed laminar flow and required a fixed distance between the air jet outlet and the surface of the eye . None of these techniques has been used as widely as the pressure chamber method . Our group recently developed an objective technique to measure EVP in humans based on the pressure chamber method , with the goal of objectively and consistently identifying a specific endpoint of vessel compression Sit et al. , 2011 . Key features include a high-definition video camera to capture images of the vein as it is compressed , a computer-controlled motor drive to increase pressure in the chamber as a linear ramp , a pressure transducer to measure the pressure in the chamber , and a computer and software to control these components . The membrane is inflated at a constant rate for a preset duration and pressure in the chamber and images of the episcleral vein are recorded and synchronized by the software . In the video stream , episcleral veins appear straighter and deeper than the conjunctival vessels , and are often bifurcated . The vein being measured is assumed to be uncollapsed prior to increasing the chamber pressure above ambient pressure . As pressure in the chamber is increased by the motor drive , the collapse of the vein can be seen as a reduction of vessel intensity and sometimes vessel narrowing in sequential frames of the video . Each video frame corresponds to a pressure measured in the chamber . Image processing techniques can be used to identify an objective endpoint of vessel collapse by using several image metrics to analyze the video stream . We first select the green color channel of each image to maximize contrast between the vessels and back-ground vessels appear dark against a light background in red-free images . A homogenization filter is used to render a uniform back-ground image brightness around the vein . An observer then selects a vessel and draws a line across and perpendicular to the vessel Fig. 2 . The image intensity along the line is displayed , and the episcleral vein appears as a trough in this profile . As pressure across the membrane increases , collapsing and blanching the vein , the intensity difference between the sclera and mid-vein decreases , and in many cases the width of the profile also decreases as the vein becomes narrower . These and other metrics of the image profile can be used to identify various degrees of collapse , including the point where the vessel is “half-blanched” or , by back projection , where the vessel just begins to collapse . The pressure in the chamber is associated with each video frame , because of the synchronous recording , and EVP is inferred from the pressure associated with a particular endpoint of collapse . Several metrics of vascular status calculated from the bright-ness profile are illustrated in Fig. 3 . The simplest is the ‘Peak , ’ defined as the difference between the background intensity and the minimum intensity . In fact , this is a trough , although we call it a peak because it represents the maximum difference between brightness of the vein and the background . The background intensity is determined from the mean of the five points at each end of the line . The vein ‘Width , ’ is the width of the curve at half of the intensity drop from background to minimum . We have also examined the ‘Area’ of the intensity profile , the sum of the differences between the curve and the background along the entire curve , and the ‘Bounded Area , ’ the area under the intensity profile , bounded by the Width . These metrics typically show three phases of change as the vessel collapses with increasing applied pressure Fig. 4 . While the applied pressure is less than the vascular pressure , they demon-strate an initial stable phase with no compression . As the pressure increases and the vessel begins to collapse , the metric decreases approximately linearly . Finally , after complete compression , the variable stabilizes . These phases correspond to the vascular changes described by Gaasterland and Pederson 1983 . The pres-sure applied when the vessel just begins to collapse , as suggested by Gaasterland and Pederson as the endpoint for the best estimate of EVP , can be determined by fitting a line to the transition region and finding the intersection of this line with the mean pressure during the initial stable phase . Collapse to any degree can be determined from the position along the best-fitted line through the transition . 140 Brightness Image Brightness Peak 4 . Episcleral venous pressure in humans Numerous investigators have studied EVP in human subjects . Not surprisingly , because of the inability to identify a clear endpoint of vascular collapse , a wide range of normal EVP has been reported . Mean EVP in seated humans has ranged from 7.6 mmHg to 11.4 mmHg depending on the study Table 2 . Linner et al. 1950 used the pressure chamber technique and the torsion balance technique to measure EVP in 33 normal subjects , and reported a mean of 11.4 0.2 mmHg and 10.0 0.4 mmHg , respectively . Phelps and Armaly 1978 used the pressure chamber technique to measure EVP in 56 normal subjects and found a mean of 9.0 1.6 mmHg with a range of 5.6e12.0 mmHg . Podos et al. 1968 used the force transducer technique and found that mean EVP in 39 eyes of 31 normal subjects was 9.0 1.4 mmHg , with a range of 6.0e11.7 mmHg . Zeimer et al. , using their slit-lamp mounted ven-omanometer the basic instrument for our computerized venom-anometer , found that among a sample of 122 eyes of 68 normal subjects EVP was 7.6 1.3 mm Hg Zeimer et al. , 1983 . Virtually all studies of EVP in humans have used the device developed by Zeimer et al. since it became available commercially . Nevertheless , a wide range of mean EVP has been reported for normal subjects Sultan and Blondeau , 2003 Toris et al. , 1999 Zeimer et al. , 1983 . Mean EVP probably varies by less than 1 mmHg throughout life . Sultan and Blondeau 2003 reported EVP of 7.9 1.5 mmHg in Table 2 Episcleral venous pressure EVP in normal subjects in the sitting position , measured by using non-invasive techniques selected studies . Study Technique Number of EVP mmHg subjects mean SD Table 3 Metric Endpoints normal subjects 18e30 years old and 8.6 1.9 mmHg in normal subjects 65 years and older . However , Gaasterland et al. 1978 as well as Toris et al. 1999 investigated the effects of aging on aqueous humor dynamics , and neither found an association between age and EVP . Toris et al. 1999 found that in normal subjects without prescription medications , the EVP was 9.1 1.6 mmHg for individuals between 20 and 30 years old , and 9.4 1.8 mmHg for individuals 60 years and older . We measured EVP in a group of 18 normal subjects unpublished data , mean age , 29.7 7.5 years by using the computerized epis-cleral venomanometer described above Sit et al. , 2011 . EVP was determined from several objective endpoints based on the profile of image intensity on a line drawn across the vessel Table 3 . The estimate of EVP varied through as much as 6 mmHg , depending on the specific degree of vessel collapse chosen as the endpoint . If we consider Gaasterland and Pederson’s measurements of vascular pressure during vessel collapse , the true EVP is close to the applied pressure that just begins to compress the vessel , and was repre-sented in our analysis as the 100 % or 90 % patency of the vessel . The pressures associated with these endpoints were similar to the pressures reported by Zeimer et al. 1983 . These investigators may have used an endpoint that corresponds more closely to the beginning of vessel collapse than subsequent investigators who used a similar instrument . Again , this demonstrates the difficulty with subjective measurement endpoints . While an observant individual investigator may be able to approximate the same endpoint with sufficient fidelity to detect large differences in EVP , smaller differences may be lost in measurement error . Because of these uncertainties , whether or not EVP is altered in glaucoma is unclear . Talusan and Schwartz 1981 found that EVP was lower in OHT patients than in normal subjects , but EVP in POAG patients was similar to EVP in normal subjects . However , Selbach et al. 2005a found that EVP was higher in POAG patients Table 4 than it was in normal tension glaucoma patients , and in both groups EVP was higher than it was in normal age-matched controls . Some types of glaucoma , such as glaucoma associated with SturgeeWeber Syndrome , are widely believed to be caused by elevated EVP Greenfield , 2000 . Phelps 1978 measured EVP by using a pressure chamber technique in a series of 10 patients with SturgeeWeber syndrome and glaucoma 8 unilateral , 2 bilateral and found that EVP varied significantly between different vessels in these patients , in contrast to normal eyes . The mean EVP in patients with unilateral hemangioma and glaucoma was 18.1 6.4 mmHg IOP ? 32.0 12.2 mmHg in the affected eye , compared with 9.1 1.6 mmHg IOP ? 16.0 2.3 mmHg in the unaffected contralateral eye . In the patients with bilateral hemangioma and glaucoma , the mean EVP was 19.3 5.0 mmHg and IOP was 28.3 2.1 mmHg . It is not clear why the difference between IOP and EVP was greater on the side with hemangioma this suggests an alteration in the outflow facility as well as EVP . However , EVP measurements in this study are also limited by the use of subjective endpoints , which rendered the exact elevation of EVP in Sturgee Weber patients uncertain . 5 . Effect of glaucoma medications on EVP Measuring EVP is necessary to understand the mechanisms of action of medications that affect aqueous humor dynamics . The concept of pharmacologic modulation of EVP is not new . Ascher showed nearly 70 years ago that medications could affect episcleral veins Ascher , 1942 . As discussed above , when an episcleral vessel was occluded just downstream of an anastomosis with an aqueous vein , the aqueous vein could fill with blood , or the episcleral vein could fill with aqueous humor , which he termed the “glass-rod phenomenon.” Ascher found that instiliation of 1 % eserine solution , 2 % pilocarpine , or l % butyn , could induce the glass-rod phenom-enon , and concluded that an increase in fluid velocity cleared the vessels giving them the glass-rod appearance . Alternatively , this phenomenon may have been caused by a reduction of the pressure in the episcleral vein to below that in the aqueous vein . His experiments suggested that episcleral venous pressure can be modified by medications . However , Gaasterland et al. 1975 measured the effect of pilocarpine 4 % drops on EVP in young healthy volunteers by using a pressure chamber technique , and in contrast to Ascher’s observations of the effects of cholinergics , Gaasterland et al. did not find an effect on EVP . Since that time , several studies have reported that most glau-coma medications do not reduce EVP as part of their mechanism of action in humans when measured by non-invasive methods Table 4 . Beta-adrenergic blockers , such as timolol , reduce IOP by decreasing aqueous humor production , with little or no known effect on other parameters of aqueous humor dynamics , including EVP Schenker et al. , 1981 Yablonski et al. , 1987 , 1978 . Yablonski et al. assessed the effect on aqueous humor dynamics of levobu-nolol 0.5 % in patients with ocular hypertension Yablonski et al. , 1987 . EVP was not different between eyes treated with levobu-nolol and eyes treated with placebo . Kupfer et al. 1971 investi-gated the effects of systemic acetazolamide 250 mg and topical L-epinephrine bitartrate 2 % on aqueous humor dynamics of young healthy subjects , and neither medication showed a significant effect on EVP . Most studies suggest that prostaglandin analogs , which are believed to decrease IOP by increasing uveoscleral outflow , have little or no effect on EVP . Sponsel et al. 2000 assessed the effects of latanoprost and timolol gel-forming solution on normal subjects and did not detect any change in EVP with either medication . Toris et al. 2007 evaluated the effects of travoprost 0.004 % once daily in ocular hypertensive subjects and did not find any change in EVP . In another study of ocular hypertensive and primary open angle glaucoma patients , Toris et al. 2004 evaluated the mechanisms of action of unoprostone 0.15 % twice daily , and did not find a signifi-cant change in EVP . Dr. Carl Camras worked on these investigations and had a particular interest in uveoscleral outflow and its modu-lation by glaucoma medications . The effect of alpha-adrenergic agonists on EVP has been a little more interesting . Toris et al. 1995b reported a significant decrease in EVP in ocular hypertensive subjects treated with apraclonidine 0.5 % twice daily for 1 week in one eye . In that study , EVP decreased from 9.7 0.3 mmHg at baseline to 8.7 0.3 mmHg after 1 week P 0.001 in the treated eye . However , EVP also decreased in the control eye from 9.9 0.4 mmHg at baseline to 8.6 0.2 mmHg after 1 week P 0.001 , which suggests a systemic effect . Further evidence for an effect of alpha-adrenergic agonists on EVP was reported by Reitsamer et al. 2006 , who found that EVP decreased 42 % P 0.01 within 5e10 min after topical application of bri-monidine in rabbits . In contrast , a study on ocular hypertensive humans treated with brimonidine tartrate 0.2 % twice daily for 1 week in one eye did not show any significant change in EVP Toris et al. , 1995a . Calcium channel blockers also appear to reduce IOP in part by reducing EVP . Abreu et al. 1998 found that a single drop of verapamil 0.25 % reduced EVP by 7.7 % , while one drop administered 3 times a day for two weeks reduced EVP by 12 % from a baseline of 8.4 1.0 mmHg in normal subjects . As with apraclonidine , the EVP in the contralateral , control eyes also decreased significantly , sug-gesting a systemic effect . In all studies that evaluated the effect of medications on EVP in humans , measurements of EVP were subject to the limitations of the techniques , in particular the lack of objective methods to identify vascular collapse consistently . This is particularly impor-tant for medications with complex mechanisms of action , such as prostaglandin analogs , that may modulate both trabecular and uveoscleral outflow Weinreb et al. , 2002 . Accurate measurement of EVP is required to understand the relative contributions of each of these parameters , and in some studies of humans , the measurement uncertainty associated with non-invasive measure-ments of EVP may have masked the effects of prostaglandin analogs . In an analogous recent study in mice , that measured EVP by using blood reflux into Schlemm’s canal , latanoprost reduced EVP by 50 % , from 5.7 0.2 mmHg to 2.8 0.3 mmHg P 0.001 , while betaxolol and brimonidine had no effect on EVP Millar et al. , 2010 . It is not clear why this change has not been found in humans , although measurement uncertainty may have limited the ability to detect this difference . Alternatively , mice may react differently to latanoprost than humans do . Further measurements of EVP by using objective measurement methods are needed to clarify the effects on EVP of prostaglandin analogs and other drugs that affect outflow pathways . 6 . Summary Understanding the daily variations of IOP in normal and glau-comatous eyes requires a fundamental understanding of aqueous humor dynamics . We will only obtain a complete picture of aqueous humor dynamics with objective and reproducible measurement of EVP . As well , a full understanding of the action of glaucoma therapies requires accurate and precise measurement of EVP . However , the subjective techniques that have been available for measurement of EVP in humans over the last 60 years have provided an uncertain picture of the normal range of EVP , its physiologic variation , and how EVP changes in glaucoma . The role of EVP in the therapeutic effects of medications remains unclear , particularly for compounds with complex actions , such as prosta-glandin analogs . Recent advances in technology have enabled improvements in non-invasive EVP measurement . In particular , automated identifi-cation of specific , objective , venous compression endpoints are now possible by using video capture synchronized with a record of pressure applied to the vein . Further work will allow us to under-stand fully the measurement parameters that provide the best estimates of EVP .

21646389	RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS—To induce acute E nergy demand of the heart is met by oxidation of multiple substrates , which include glucose and fatty acids FA 1,2 . The latter substrate is a favorite fuel , with almost 70 % of ATP generated from oxidation of FA under normal conditions 3 . How-ever , based on their availability under different physio-logical and pathophysiological conditions , the heart can rapidly switch its substrate selection 4,5 . In diabetes , when glucose consumption is restricted as a result of im-paired glucose transport , glycolysis , and pyruvate oxida-tion , the heart adapts to use FA exclusively 2 . Regrettably , this adjustment could be deleterious , since excess FA delivery leads to lipid overload lipotoxicity , and eventu-ally cardiomyopathy . Exogenous FA are provided to the heart from FA bound to albumin or subsequent to breakdown of circulating tri-glyceride TG -rich lipoproteins by lipoprotein lipase LPL 6,7 . This enzyme , bound to heparan sulfate proteoglycan HSPG binding sites , and strategically located at the vas-cular lumen side of endothelial cells , hydrolyzes TG to re-lease FA 8 . Endothelial cells do not express LPL 9 . In the heart , LPL is synthesized and processed in cardiomyocytes , transported to myocyte cell-surface HSPGs , and eventually transported to the coronary lumen 10,11 . Studies from our laboratory have demonstrated a robust increase of coronary LPL in an animal model of moderate diabetes these animals develop hyperglycemia without any change in circulating TG or FA 12–14 . As the in-crease in LPL occurred in the absence of any change in gene expression in the whole heart , we hypothesized that LPL is regulated by post-transcriptional mechanisms . In this regard , we reported an augmented trafficking of LPL from the Golgi to the myocyte surface , and ultimately the vascular lumen 12,13,15 . Notwithstanding this augmented trafficking , other posttranslational mechanisms could also play important roles in regulating LPL after diabetes . Cata-lytically active LPL at the vascular lumen is a homodimer , with two inactive monomeric subunits assembled non-covalently in a head-to-tail fashion 16–18 . This assem-bly relies on processing in the endoplasmic reticulum ER and involves multiple steps , including early associa-tion with the ER-resident chaperones calnexin calreticulin and subsequent dimerization facilitated by lipase matura-tion factor 1 LMF1 19–23 . Association with calnexin calreticulin allows nascent LPL folding into a proper tertiary structure qualified for dimerization only dimeric LPL is active and competent to exit the ER , en route for secretion 19,20,22 . Compared with moderate diabetes , animals with severe diabetes demonstrate a decline in coronary LPL 13 . As these animals exhibit elevated circulating FA in addition to hyperglycemia , we assumed that LPL-mediated FA de-livery would be redundant , and hence is “turned off” 13 . Mechanisms proposed for this decline in vascular LPL in-clude impaired LPL vesicle transport , FA-induced dis-placement of enzyme from endothelial HSPGs , and direct inactivation of the enzyme by product inhibition 13,24,25 . A newly identified member of the angiopoietin family , angiopoietin-like protein 4 Angptl-4 , could also be added to this list . Angptl-4 converts dimeric LPL into inactive monomers , thereby reducing LPL activity at the vascular lumen 26,27 . It is possible that in severe diabetes , ele-vated circulating FA stimulates Angptl-4 expression , and eventually LPL inhibition . The objective of the current study was to determine the contribution of enzyme assembly and disassembly in regulating cardiac LPL activity after mod-erate and severe diabetes . RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS In vitro inhibitory effect of Angtpl-4 on LPL activity . LPL from vascular RESULTS General characteristics of the experimental animals . Injection of DZ resulted in stable hyperglycemia within 4 h . These animals also exhibited an increase in circulating levels of NEFA . Although administration of STZ at both doses produced hyperglycemia of equal intensity as that seen with DZ , only D100 animals showed a robust eleva-tion in circulating FA and TG levels Table 1 . Processing of LPL into an active dimeric enzyme is increased after DZ . LPL is an enzyme present in two forms based on its affinity to a heparin–sepharose column . Monomeric LPL has low affinity to the column , is pre-dominantly eluted in 0.4–0.75 mol L NaCl fractions , and has no catalytic activity . Active LPL is a homodimer eluted at higher concentrations of NaCl 1.0–1.5 mol L 20,27 . We found that the majority of LPL in the heart is mono-meric eluted at 0.75 mol L NaCl , with only 30 % of the enzyme in the form of dimers eluted in 1.0 mol L NaCl fractions accounting for all of the LPL activity Supple-mentary Fig. 1 . Consistent with our previous studies , total LPL protein remained unchanged after acute hyperglycemia induced by DZ Fig. 1A . However , when equal amounts of homogenate protein were loaded onto a heparin–sepharose column , the 1.0 mol L fractions from DZ hearts demon-strated higher LPL activity Fig. 1B and protein Fig. 1C , suggesting the presence of more dimeric LPL in these hearts .

To determine vascular LPL , hearts were perfused with heparin , and LPL activity was measured in the perfusate . DZ hearts possessed in-creased LPL activity at this site Fig. 2A . After stripping of the dimeric enzyme from the vascular lumen with heparin , hearts with predominantly myocyte LPL were then sub-jected to a heparin–sepharose column . Interestingly , in addition to the vascular lumen , DZ hearts also harbored increased dimeric LPL in cardiomyocytes Fig. 2B , lane 1 vs. 3 . Maturation of LPL including dimerization occurs within the ER of cardiomyocytes . To further localize myocyte LPL dimers , we used endo H to digest dimeric LPL . Endo H cleaves the glycan chains of LPL based on their processing stages in different cellular organelles the 57-and 55-kDa products represent LPL that has ei-ther passed or is present within Golgi apparatus , respec-tively , whereas the 52-kDa band refers to LPL undergoing processing inside the ER 19,20 . Interestingly , DZ hearts had a higher proportion of dimeric LPL at a post-ER process-ing stage Fig. 2B , lane 2 vs. 4 , implicating augmented maturation of LPL after DZ . To examine whether this is due to acute exposure to a hyperglycemic and hyper-lipidemic environment seen in DZ animals , isolated car-diomyocytes were incubated with HG+PA for 2 h . Using the same conditions , we have previously found an accel-erated LPL trafficking from Golgi to the myocyte surface . HG+PA also increased dimerization of LPL Fig. 2C , in-dicating that processing of LPL could be a prerequisite for trafficking . Calnexin is required for LPL processing and is en - hanced after diabetes . LPL is a glycan protein whose processing into active dimers requires its association with ER-resident chaperones like calnexin calreticulin to allow proper folding . Using immunofluorescence , LPL and cal-nexin were found to be intensively colocalized at the perinuclear region Fig. 3A . LPL association with this chaperone was further confirmed by immunoprecipitation Fig. 3A , inset . Cs is a glucosidase inhibitor that blocks trimming of LPL glycan chains , such that it can not be recognized by calnexin 22 . Using Cs , we were able to inhibit the association between LPL and calnexin a com-plete absence of the perinuclear colocalization of these proteins was observed Fig. 3B , inset . This hindered LPL secretion and processing both secreted Fig. 3B and in-tracellular Fig. 3C LPL activity declined in the presence of Cs , likely due to reduced LPL dimerization Fig. 3C , inset . To determine whether HG+PA augmented LPL processing by affecting the association between calnexin and newly synthesized LPL , cardiomyocytes were pre-treated with the protein synthesis inhibitor CHX . After 1 h , as a result of no newly synthesized LPL entry into the ER , CHX abolished the association between LPL and calnexin Fig. 3D , inset 2 . Upon removal of CHX and renewal of protein synthesis , association between newly synthesized LPL and calnexin was visualized in the pres-ence or absence of HG+PA . One hour after re-entry of LPL into the ER , newly synthesized LPL was observed colo-calized with calnexin at the perinuclear region Fig. 3D , inset 3 . However , in contrast to Cs , even though HG+PA attenuated this colocalization Fig. 3D , inset 4 , more LPL was observed present at the cell surface , suggesting that more enzyme had completed processing under these conditions . Increased LPL processing was also re-flected by more active LPL being released into the media Fig. 3D . To examine LPL processing subsequent to chronic di-abetes , 55 mg kg of STZ was administered to generate “moderate diabetes” . Similar to DZ , although chronic di-abetes did not increase total LPL protein data not shown , D55 hearts also demonstrated higher amounts of dimeric LPL Fig. 4A . The importance of calnexin in LPL process-ing is also suggested in D55 hearts augmented LPL di-merization in these hearts was accompanied by increased calnexin expression Fig. 4B . However , we did not observe the same increase in calnexin when cardiomyocytes were acutely exposed to HG+PA data not shown . Another crucial factor for LPL dimerization , LMF1 , was found to be unchanged after D55 Supplementary Fig. 2 . Overall , our data suggest that after diabetes , more LPL is processed into its active dimeric form , which appears to involve the ER chaperone calnexin . Severe diabetes reduces dimeric LPL in the heart with increased expression of Angptl-4 . Increasing the dose of STZ to 100 mg kg D100 produced hypergly-cemia similar to that observed in D55 animals . However , unlike D55 , D100 animals developed severe hyperlipidemia Table 1 . Additionally , in contrast to D55 , D100 animals showed a decline in dimeric LPL , both in the whole heart Fig. 5A and at the vascular lumen Fig. 5B . This effect on LPL was not a result of decreased calnexin expression in D100 Fig. 5C but was accompanied by a robust increase in Angptl-4 serum concentrations Fig. 5D . Furthermore , cardiac expression of Angptl-4 protein Fig. 5E and mRNA Fig. 5E , inset was also found to be higher in D100 animals . Angptl-4 is capable of inhibiting LPL activity and its expression is stimulated by FA . To test the direct in-hibitory effect of Angptl-4 on LPL , dimeric LPL collected FIG. 4 . Chronic diabetes also augments LPL processing with increased expression of calnexin . For chronic diabetes , animals were injected with 55 mg kg STZ D55 and after 4 days , hearts were removed . Equal amounts of total protein from control CON and D55 heart homoge-nates were loaded onto a heparin–sepharose column , prewashed with 0.25 mol L NaCl , and eluted with 0.75 , 1.0 , and 1.5 mol L NaCl . LPL activity in each fraction was analyzed A , and fractions from 1.0 mol L NaCl containing LPL dimers were combined to determine LPL amount by Western blot after TCA precipitation . Only a representative chro-matography A and blot of LPL A , inset are shown from five repeated experiments . Dividing lines on Western blot images describe where bands from the same blot have been juxtaposed . Calnexin protein ex-pression Cn in CON and D55 hearts was determined by Western blot and normalized to GAPDH B . Results are the mean 6 SE of five animals in each group . **Significantly different from control , P 0.01 . from the vascular lumen of D55 animals was incubated with purified Angptl-4 in vitro . The inhibition of LPL ac-tivity by Angptl-4 was fast within 15 min and dose dependent , with 1 mg mL Angptl-4 inhibiting 85 % of the enzyme activity at 2 h Fig. 6A . It should be noted that the serum concentration of Angptl-4 in D100 animals 1 ng mL was effective in inhibiting 20 % of LPL activity in vitro Fig. 6A . When this concentration of Angptl-4 was per-fused through D55 hearts for 1 h , LPL activity remaining at the vascular lumen was reduced Fig. 6C . Interestingly , this reduction in LPL activity correlated with an increased appearance of monomeric LPL in the perfusion buffer Fig. 6B and a decline in dimeric LPL remaining at the coronary lumen Fig. 6C , inset , suggesting that the inhibitory action of Angptl-4 on LPL is through the conversion of dimeric LPL into monomers , which in turn reduces its affinity to the binding sites at the vascular lumen . This inhibitory effect of Angptl-4 was also observed in isolated hearts Supplementary Fig. 3A and cardiomyocytes Supple-mentary Fig. 3B and C from control animals . To duplicate the elevated serum NEFA level seen in D100 animals , isolated cardiomyocytes were treated with 1.0 mmol L PA for 4–24 h . Within 4 h of exposure to PA , Angptl-4 mRNA did not change significantly . However , at 12 h , increase in Angptl-4 mRNA was observed , an effect that was even more dramatic after a 24-h exposure to PA Fig. 6D . DISCUSSION The majority of FA provided to the heart comes from breakdown of circulating TG , a process catalyzed by LPL located at the vascular lumen 35 . In mice with cardiac overexpression of LPL , excess lipid uptake is evident , with development of dilated cardiomyopathy 36 . Paradoxi-cally , chronic cardiac depletion of LPL is also associated with a decrease in cardiac ejection fraction 37 . Thus , cardiac LPL is of crucial importance for regulating lipid metabolism in hearts , and disturbing its innate function is sufficient to cause cardiomyopathy . Diabetes is a unique metabolic disorder during which either an increase mod-erate type 1 diabetes or decrease severe type 1 diabetes in vascular LPL activity is observed . Data from this study suggest that after acute hyperglycemia and moderate di-abetes , more LPL is processed into an active dimeric form , whereas severe diabetes is associated with increased con-version of LPL into inactive monomers Fig. 7 . In type 1 diabetic patients , insulin supplementation can never mimic the exquisite control of glucose by pancreatic insulin seen in normal individuals . Multiple finger pricks and insulin injections three to four per day mean poor patient compliance , repeated exposure to bouts of in-adequate glucose control and a shift in cardiac metabo-lism , and cardiovascular disease in the long term . To imitate this poorly controlled type 1 diabetic patient ex-posed to acute hyperglycemia , we used DZ . Measurement of LPL protein expression in the heart revealed no change after acute hyperglycemia . However , the drawback with this measurement is that it does not distinguish active LPL from its inactive monomeric form . Using the heparin– sepharose column , our data for the first time show that acute hyperglycemia can indeed increase the amount of dimeric LPL in the heart . We are unaware of a similar in-crease in dimeric LPL in other physiology or pathology . In fact , the reverse is often seen with lipid metabolism dis-orders . In one case of human familial LPL deficiency , the Tyr262 ? His mutation of the LPL gene results in shifting of dimeric LPL to monomers 38 . In addition , in cell lines derived from animals with a mutation cld that impairs posttranslational processing of LPL , a significant amount of inactive LPL is produced as aggregated monomers 21 . The increased dimeric LPL in the whole heart after acute hyperglycemia correlated well with the elevated LPL ac-tivity at the vascular lumen . Our data suggest that after a rapid rise in circulating glucose , a unique augmentation in LPL dimerization contributes toward increased coro-nary enzyme , delivering more FA to the heart . After stripping of dimeric LPL from the vascular lumen , more LPL dimers were still evident in the myocytes from acute diabetic animals . These dimeric LPL could be lo-cated inside the ER , Golgi , or secretion vesicles or at the myocyte surface . Interestingly , the majority of dimeric LPL displayed resistance to endo H digestion 20 . This sug-gested that after DZ , LPL processing is very efficient , with more LPL completing its maturation in the ER before moving to the Golgi . Early processing of LPL into a con-formation competent for dimerization is suggested to in-volve chaperones like calreticulin calnexin . For example , in a transfected sf21 cell line , folding dimerization of hu-man LPL is only promoted when calreticulin is coex-pressed 39 . In addition , the impaired LPL processing seen in cld cld mice is related to a decreased expression of calnexin 40 . In our study , LPL in control cardiomyocytes was found associated with calnexin . As interruption of this association by Cs hindered LPL dimerization and secre-tion , our data imply that calnexin is important for LPL processing in the heart . We have previously found that HG+PA increased LPL trafficking from the Golgi to myocyte surface 12,15 . The current data suggest that HG and PA are also responsible for enhanced LPL dimerization . To test whether the effect of an acute diabetic environment on LPL processing is not a transient response , we turned to a more chronic diabetes model using D55 animals . A significant increase in the amount of LPL dimers correlated with an increased ex-pression of calnexin in D55 hearts . As no change in LMF1 gene expression was observed , our data suggest that chronic diabetes may have a profound impact on the early processing events of LPL dimerization . It is possible that the increased calnexin expression after chronic diabetes is related to the unfolded protein response UPR , an adaptive mechanism that augments protein processing efficiency af-ter ER stress 41 . One of the three well-defined arms of UPR includes up-regulation of ER chaperone expression through activation of inositol-requiring kinase 1 IRE-1 on the ER membrane 42,43 . It should be noted that acute exposure to HG+PA had no effect on calnexin expres-sion . Nevertheless , this environment could still alter the processing efficiency of LPL by affecting chaperone activity and accessibility in the ER through calcium and extracellular signal–regulated kinase ERK-1 . Calcium is an important FIG . 7 . Moderate and severe diabetes have a differential impact on LPL at the coronary lumen . In moderate diabetes , more monomeric LPL is processed into dimeric , catalytically active enzyme with the help of the ER chaperone calnexin . This increases LPL at the vascular lumen , breaking down more circulating TG to deliver increased FA to the heart when glucose utilization is compromised . In severe diabetes , when FA are excessive , an FA-induced expression of Angptl-4 leads to conver-sion of LPL to inactive monomers at the coronary lumen to impede TG hydrolysis . EC , endothelial cells Nu , nucleus . cofactor for protein folding in the ER , facilitating LPL di-merization , and can also impact the structural stability and substrate recognition of calnexin 44,45 . ERK-1 , activated in an IRE-dependent manner , can directly phosphorylate calnexin at Ser563 , resulting in its recruitment to ribosomes , potentially rendering it more accessible to newly synthe-sized proteins 46,47 . The role of calcium and ERK-1 on LPL maturation , and how diabetes could potentially alter LPL processing through these pathways , requires investi-gation . In contrast to D55 , D100 animals have a more profound loss of pancreatic b-cells and reduction in circulating in-sulin . Under these conditions , excessive lipolysis and he-patic lipoprotein secretion increases serum FA and TG , respectively . Thus , these doses of STZ represent a contin-uum of poor glycemic control , from moderate D55 to severe D100 . To avoid lipid overload , LPL activity at the coronary lumen decreased in D100 hearts , and this could be due to enzyme inactivation by conversion from a di-meric to monomeric conformation 26 . Angptl-4 , identi-fied to bring about this conversion , is expressed in various tissues , including white adipose tissue , liver , heart , and skeletal muscle 48 . This secreted protein can function in circulation , breaking down vascular LPL 49 . Our data , for the first time , report a robust increase of Angptl-4 protein , both in the serum and heart tissue from D100 animals , an effect that was not seen in D55 . Given that the serum concentration of Angptl-4 in D100 was capable of inhibit-ing the activity of vascular LPL released from D55 hearts in vitro , we assumed that introduction of Angptl-4 to D55 hearts would give these hearts a D100 phenotype . Indeed , a drop of LPL activity was observed at the vascular lumen in D55 hearts perfused with Angptl-4 , an effect that cor-related well with the inhibitory efficiency in vitro . The reduction of coronary LPL activity could be due to the increased conversion of dimeric LPL into monomers , with subsequent detachment from the vascular binding sites . This effect of Angptl-4 was also evident in control hearts . Long chain FA , through activation of proliferator-activated receptor d , has been reported to increase the transcrip-tion of Angptl-4 in skeletal muscle cells 50 . In our study , as Angptl-4 expression in cardiomyocytes was also up-regulated after exposure to PA more than 4 h , the de-crease of LPL in D100 could be through an FA–Angptl-4 pathway . As this effect was absent in DZ that had short term hyperlipidemia less than 4 h , our data suggest that “turning off” LPL requires prolonged exposure to FA . Whether the increased expression of Angptl-4 seen in D100 hearts could contribute toward inhibition of LPL at the coronary lumen is currently unknown . Nevertheless , purified Angptl-4 was capable of directly inhibiting LPL in or on cardiomyocytes . In addition , in mice overexpressing Angptl-4 specifically in the heart , a reduced cardiac LPL activity was found without affecting this enzyme in other LPL-expressing tissues , implying a tight link between tissue-specific Angptl-4 and local or proximal vascular LPL activity 48 . In summary , after diabetes , recruitment of LPL to the vascular lumen could represent an immediate compensa-tory response to guarantee FA supply . In moderate type 1 diabetes , an exaggerated LPL processing to dimeric , cat-alytically active enzyme increases vascular LPL , delivering more FA to the heart when glucose utilization is com-promised . In severe diabetes , FA-induced expression of Angptl-4 leads to conversion of LPL to inactive monomers at the coronary lumen to impede TG hydrolysis and FA supply . We suggest that both compensatory processes that alter the innate function of LPL at the vascular lumen during diabetes could be the forerunner for cardiomyopathy seen with this disease . Limitations . When examining LPL in humans , heparin has been used to displace LPL , and either a decrease or no change in its activity has been reported in type 1 diabetic patients . As this approach releases LPL from other tissues , including skeletal muscle and adipose tissue , it is inca-pable of establishing cardiac LPL content . However , even if heart homogenates from patients with diabetes were used , it would still be inappropriate , as it would reflect total cardiac LPL and not the functional pool of enzyme at the coronary lumen . The animal models used in this study may not perfectly mimic the clinical condition . Neverthe-less , they allowed us to distinguish functional LPL from total enzyme , and uncovered how inadequate glycemic control could lead to cardiovascular disease through ma-nipulation of LPL-governed lipid metabolism .

21659498	RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS—Enzyme-linked im - 2011 Vhas ascular calcification is a strong independent pre-dictor of cardiovascular mortality 1 . In people with diabetes , medial arterial calcification MAC emerged as a strong predictor of lower limb amputation and cardiovascular mortality 2,3 . This may be to the result of an increase in arterial stiffness , pulse wave velocity , and systolic blood pressure , ultimately leading to reduced coronary perfusion and ventricular hypertrophy 4 . MAC in people with diabetes is more common in those with peripheral neuropathy , who also display increased bone resorption osteolysis 5–7 , typi-cally seen in Charcot neuroarthropathy CN . The signal-ing pathway of the receptor activator of nuclear factor-kB RANK , RANK ligand RANKL , and its decoy receptor osteoprotegerin OPG has been suggested as the link be-tween vascular and bone metabolism 8,9 . In fact , RANKL has been shown to mediate osteolysis in CN by stimulating osteoclastic differentiation of monocytes macrophages , an effect that is attenuated by OPG , the decoy receptor 10 . This has led to nascent theories implicating RANKL OPG signaling as the potential pathogenetic basis for CN . RANKL exists in two biologically active soluble forms secreted by T cells , endothelial cells , or osteoblasts or proteolytically cleaved from cell surfaces . RANKL binds to its target receptor RANK on cell surfaces including vas-cular smooth muscle cells [ VSMCs ] to generate multiple intracellular signals that regulate cell differentiation , func-tion , and survival 8,11,12 . In the vasculature , RANKL is expressed and upregulated in calcifying vascular cells 13 and enhances the recruitment and infiltration of cells that have been shown to stimulate VSMC mineralization 14 . Most of the evidence for a direct role of RANKL OPG signaling in vascular calcification is derived from animal studies with limited human data . For instance , with the use of VSMCs from rat aorta , RANKL has been shown to in-crease VSMC calcification via activation of the alternate nuclear factor-kB NF-kB pathway 15 . However , to en-hance translational applications , we extend these data to human VSMCs and use of patient serum . In diabetic CN , there is osteolysis and simultaneous vascular calcification , potentially leading to amputation 16,17 . Therefore , the aim of this study was to determine the role of RANKL OPG signaling in MAC in diabetic CN by using an in vitro model of vascular calcification . RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS RANKL and OPG enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay . Serum RANKL Tissue collection and immunohistochemistry for RANKL expression . Explanting and culture of human VSMCs .

TABLE 1 General characteristics of study patients eGFR , estimated glomerular filtration rate . Localized RANKL expression and medial arterial calcification . To determine whether local RANKL ex-pression was upregulated in calcified versus noncalcified arteries , sections of calcified tibial artery and noncalcified IMA were stained immunohistochemically with anti-human RANKL antibody and Alizarin red. Figure 1 shows a rep-resentative section of calcified human tibial artery and a noncalcified IMA . The tibial artery displayed both medial and intimal calcification with positive RANKL staining detected within the vicinity of the calcified areas B1 , B2 , and B3 C1 and C2 . There was a distinct lack of positive RANKL staining in noncalcified areas D1 and D2 and control IMA segments A1 , A2 , and A3 . Serum OPG and RANKL levels in patients with CN , diabetic patients , and healthy control subjects . ELISA was performed to determine serum levels of RANKL and OPG in the two patient groups and control subjects . Se-rum OPG levels were higher in patients with CN 8.2 6 2.7 pmol L , ANOVA P 0.031 compared with diabetic patients 7.7 6 3.3 pmol L and healthy control subjects 4.2 6 0.7 pmol L Fig. 2A . The Bonferroni post hoc test showed that OPG levels were higher in patients with CN versus control subjects P 0.01 and in diabetic patients versus control subjects P 0.029 , but not significantly different between patients with CN and patients with di-abetes P 0.638 . In a similar trend , RANKL levels in patients with CN were 0.3 6 0.042 pmol L , approximately 8-and 15-fold higher than in patients with diabetes 0.04 6 0.05 pmol L and healthy control subjects 0.02 6 0.01 pmol L , respectively ANOVA test , P 0.055 . The Bonferroni test showed that patients with CN had higher serum levels of RANKL than diabetic patients P 0.033 or healthy control subjects P 0.063 , but there were no significant differences between diabetic patients and control subjects P 0.895 Fig. 2B . Most important , the RANKL OPG ratio was significantly higher in patients with CN [ 36.8 6 43.1 ] 3 1023 , ANOVA P 0.033 com-pared with those with diabetes [ 5.2 6 4.9 ] 3 1023 or healthy control subjects [ 4.6 6 3.1 ] 3 1023 Fig. 2C . The Bonferroni test showed that the RANKL OPG ratio was higher in patients with CN than in diabetic patients P 0.019 and in patients with CN than in control subjects P 0.051 , but differences between diabetic patients and control subjects were not significant P 0.974 Serum protein analysis of inflammatory and angiogenic cytokines . To determine whether an inflammatory milieu stimulus may be modulated in patients with CN and thus driving elevated RANKL expression and subsequent se-cretion into systemic circulation in this group , we analyzed a panel of nine cytokines using a Bio-plex multiarray suspension assay Fig. 3 . We demonstrated that two proinflammatory cytokines GCSF and IL-8 were signif-icantly higher in patients with CN compared with diabetic patients and control subjects . This may well reflect an elevated inflammatory environment in patients with CN acting as the stimulus for elevated RANKL secretion . The serum levels of noninflammatory cytokines were not significantly different among the patients with CN , com-pared with patients with diabetes , and control patients . Charcot serum accelerates osteogenic differentiation and mineralization of VSMCs. Figure 4A shows results from the culture of human VSMCs at day 7 under the dif-ferent conditions . Cells treated with Charcot serum dis-played increased calcification as evidenced by Alizarin red staining . After dye elution and quantification , there were overall differences ANOVA P , 0.0001 in the ex-tent of mineralization between the different culture con-ditions Fig. 4C . Mineralization was higher in human VSMCs coincubated in Charcot serum OD 0.16 6 0.01 vs. OM control subjects 0.09 6 0.003 , P 0.0003 compared with diabetic serum OD 0.15 6 0.01 vs. OM , P 0.0004 or healthy serum OD 0.14 6 0.03 vs. OM , P 0.037 Fig. 4C . Likewise , one-way ANOVA test showed that the early osteogenic differentiation marker , ALP , was significantly different P , 0.0001 in human VSMCs subcultured in any of the three patient sera compared with OM that contained FBS same concentration in place of patient serum . The effect was most marked in Charcot than in diabetes serum . At day 7 , the ALP activity of human VSMCs cultured in Charcot serum 49.9 6 7.3 was approximately twofold higher than that induced by diabetes serum 29.8 6 3.7 mmol L phosphate mg protein min , P 0.013 and threefold higher than either healthy serum 17.6 6 10.1 , P 0.011 or OM control subjects 15.3 6 5.4 mmol L phosphate mg protein min , P 0.003 Fig. 4B . Charcot serum and RANKL induce human VSMC min-eralization in the absence of a high calcium phosphate milieu . To establish whether factors in Charcot serum or RANKL triggered the mineralization process per se or needed the presence of the elevated calcium and phosphate in the osteogenic conditions , cells were grown in ordinary growth medium to which the Charcot serum or RANKL was added . The VSMCs were shown to have a greater capacity to mineralize when cultured in the presence of Charcot se-rum OD 0.07 6 0.003 , P 0.0009 or recombinant RANKL OD 0.072 6 0.003 , P 0.0002 compared with ordinary growth medium only OD 0.059 6 0.002 data not shown .

OPG attenuates Charcot serum-induced osteoblastic differentiation of VSMCs . The anti-RANKL effect of OPG on VSMC osteoblastic differentiation and minerali-zation induced by Charcot and diabetes sera is shown in Fig. 5A–C . Compared with VSMCs subcultured in Charcot FIG. 2 .

A high-quality color representation of this figure is available in the online issue . serum alone , coincubation of VSMCs with Charcot serum plus OPG resulted in an attenuation of osteoblastic dif-ferentiation ALP activity 49.9 6 7.3 vs. 12.2 6 8.6 , P 0.004 and mineralization OD 0.16 6 0.01 vs. 0.13 6 0.003 , P 0.018 of these cells Fig. 5B and C . However , VSMCs coincubated with diabetes serum and OPG showed only a trend toward less mineralization OD 0.14 6 0.004 and reduced osteoblastic differentia-tion ALP activity , 20.9 6 10.9 compared with those cul-tured in diabetes serum alone Fig. 5B and C the difference failed to achieve statistical significance . Charcot serum and RANKL induce mineralization by NF-kB nuclear translocation in vitro . To establish the downstream effects of Charcot serum or RANKL on tran-scription factors that may be involved in the mineralization of human VSMCs , we investigated the activation of the NF-kB pathway . VSMCs were subcultured for 1 h in Charcot serum 5 % v v or recombinant RANKL 20 pmol L and stained immunocytochemically for the p65 component of NF-kB to detect its intracellular localization . Representa-tive photomicrographs obtained after immunofluorescent staining for NF-kB are shown in Fig. 6A and B. After 1 h of culture of VSMCs in osteogenic media to which Charcot serum was added , NF-kB translocated from its cytoplas-mic location to a predominantly nuclear and perinuclear location Fig. 6A , images D and G . When VSMCs were incubated with recombinant RANKL in lieu of Charcot serum , nuclear translocation of p65 component of NF-kB was equally observed Fig. 6B , images D and G . OPG blocks Charcot and RANKL-induced translocation of NF-kB . To validate that the RANKL OPG signaling in-volved translocation of NF-kB during mineralization of VSMCs , immunostaining was performed on subcultures of VSMCs Charcot or RANKL coincubated with OPG . The presence of OPG abrogated the NF-kB nuclear translocation induced by Charcot serum Fig. 6A , images E and H or recombinant RANKL Fig. 6B , images E and H , thus con-firming that NF-kB activation induced by Charcot serum directly involved RANKL RANK OPG signaling . DISCUSSION Our results have demonstrated that RANKL RANK OPG signaling is implicated in human MAC in people with di-abetes and CN . The RANKL immunolocalization data suggest a direct association between localized tissue ex-pression of RANKL and MAC . Patients with CN also dis-played high levels of inflammatory cytokines IL-8 , GCSF , OPG , RANKL , and particularly elevated RANKL OPG ratio compared with diabetic patients or healthy volunteers . The high systemic level of RANKL enables it to bind to its re-ceptor , RANK , and drive vascular smooth muscles cells into an osteoblastic differentiation pathway resulting in accelerated deposition of a mineralized matrix leading to MAC . This differentiation process is mediated by RANKL-induced translocation of NF-kB from the cytoplasm into the nucleus Fig. 6A and B , leading to downstream nu-clear mechanisms culminating in upregulated osteoblastic genes and increased ALP activity Fig. 4B . The specific decoy receptor for RANKL , OPG , abrogates the osteo-blastic differentiation of human VSMCs . It should be emphasized that this was an in vitro study , and we did not seek to correlate the clinical stage of CN to the extent of MAC or the serum level of RANKL OPG . This is an obvious limitation that will be addressed through future correlative clinical studies . High serum levels of inflammatory cytokines and RANKL OPG ratio expressed in patients with CN . The bone changes seen in CN are customarily thought to be triggered by events that enhance an inflammatory mi-lieu , inducing monocytes into an osteoclastic differentia-tion program 10,22,23 . We show that IL-8 and GCSF are two proinflammatory cytokines that are elevated in the serum of patients with CN . Inflammatory cytokines induce activated T cells to secrete RANKL 24,25 , and attendant to this , OPG levels increase to counteract the effects of RANKL 26 . Figure 2 illustrates that both RANKL and OPG levels are higher in patients with CN . The current study is the first to provide data on systemic levels of RANKL and OPG in patients with CN . There is evidence in the literature reporting elevated levels of RANKL and OPG in other disease conditions associated with high bone turnover and vascular calcification , notably rheumatoid arthritis 27,28 , Paget’s disease 29,30 , and osteoporosis 31–33 . In particular , most studies reveal that the RANKL OPG ratio is the more significant predictor of these disease conditions . Our data showing that the ratio of RANKL OPG is significantly higher in patients with CN than in diabetic patients or nondiabetic control subjects Fig. 2C support these findings . Whether there is a cutoff ratio that may be diagnostic of CN or the ratio can be used to monitor dis-ease activity remains to be elucidated . However , the high levels of the RANKL OPG ratio can be anticipated to or-chestrate deleterious effects on the vasculature as dis-cussed below . Local expression of RANKL in the vicinity of MAC . Local RANKL expression within the medial layer of the vasculature coincided with areas of MAC . Intense RANKL staining was observed in the vicinity of calcified areas confirmed by alizarin staining and a lack of staining in the negative tissue control shown here as IMA and the nonimmune IgG intra-assay control results not shown . These findings agree with and support results from pre-vious studies demonstrating increased RANKL protein and mRNA expression patterns in MAC Monckeberg’s scle-rosis 34,35 . Schoppet et al. 35 also found that OPG was predominantly adjacent to areas of calcification and areas of apoptosis throughout the whole circumference of their arterial specimens . However , the data for OPG immunostaining are less consistent in the literature . A study by Kaden et al. 13 on calcific aortic stenosis con-firmed the positive correlation between RANKL immunos-taining and calcification , but showed an inverse relationship between OPG immunostaining and calcified aortic steno-sis . However , in the study by Kaden et al. , decalcification was performed by placing tissue sections for 48 h in 270 mmol L EDTA , a protocol that has not been replicated elsewhere and that may affect epitope exposure . Charcot serum and RANKL accelerate mineralization and osteoblastic differentiation of VSMCs via NF-kB nuclear translocation . Our data demonstrate that ex-planted resident VSMCs undergo an osteogenic differentia-tion when cultured in media containing Charcot serum Fig. 4B , a milieu that we show contains a high RANKL OPG ratio Fig. 2C . Our data suggest that systemic OPG is in-creased in patients with CN probably in response to and to mitigate the effects of high levels of RANKL . It is worth noting that although both OPG and RANKL levels were higher in diabetic patients compared with healthy control subjects , the RANKL OPG ratio was not different between these two groups . It is therefore likely that elevated OPG levels in diabetic patients do compensate for elevated RANKL levels such that the ratio remains comparable to that of nondiabetic control subjects . To further support the hypothesis that RANKL mediates MAC in patients with CN , immunocytochemical studies reveal that both RANKL-and Charcot-induced differenti-ation of human VSMCs are associated with the trans-location of NF-kB from the cytoplasm into the nucleus Fig. 6 . Of note , RANKL and Charcot serum enhanced miner-alization of human VSMCs even in nonosteogenic con-ditions , i.e. , normal growth medium without any added b-glycerophosphate or calcium . This finding refutes com-monly held suggestions that MAC is merely a direct pre-cipitation of inorganic calcium and phosphate ions when their levels are high in systemic circulation . Our data provide direct evidence of mineralization of human VSMCs in vitro by using nonosteogenic culture conditions . In fact , vascular calcification is an intricate and highly organized process involving cell differentiation , matrix deposition , and sec-ondary ossification resulting in the formation of hydroxy-apatite . In this study , we show that the cells are not only depositing a mineralized matrix but also actually switching their phenotype into osteoblastic cells as suggested by the elevated ALP activity , which is a marker of early osteogenic differentiation . There is some controversy regarding the origin of cells that undergo osteogenic differentiation in MAC . Although some authors have suggested that circulating osteogenic precursor cells migrate from the blood through the vessel wall to differentiate locally into osteoblastic cells , others have maintained that these osteoblastic cells originate from residential human VSMCs displaying marked pheno-typic plasticity under specific stimuli . Our study supports the latter hypothesis because it demonstrates using an in vitro model that explanted human VSMCs of medial origin directly differentiate into an osteoblastic phenotype . Our data support those of Schoppet et al. 35 , who found that the medial tissue surrounding calcified lesions in MAC contained only smooth muscle cells , whereas macro-phages and lymphocytes were absent . By using VSMCs from rat aortas , Panizo et al. 15 demonstrated that RANKL induced mineralization in a dose-dependent manner , an effect abrogated by OPG . Data reported in this study support and extend those of Panizo et al. , implicating RANKL OPG signaling in MAC by using smooth muscle cells from human origin . OPG blocks RANKL-and Charcot-induced NF-kB nu-clear translocation , and mineralization of human VSMCs . This study showed that OPG , a specific decoy receptor for RANKL , attenuated mineralization and osteo-blastic differentiation of VSMCs induced by Charcot serum or RANKL . Our data also suggest a more pronounced effect of OPG on Charcot-mediated differentiation and minerali-zation of VSMCs compared with that induced by diabetes serum . Because OPG directly and specifically blocks the action of RANKL , these data provide additional evidence of RANKL RANK signal modulation in CN-induced MAC . The nuclear translocation of NF-kB was also abrogated by coincubation with OPG , thus lending support to the key mechanistic role played by NF-kB in RANKL-induced min-eralization . In fact , binding of RANKL to its receptor RANK may activate the canonical or the alternative pathway of NF-kB signaling 36,37 . Tseng et al. 38 recently used a murine model of calci-fication to show that atherosclerotic calcification involves bone remodeling with simultaneous activation of both osteoclastic and osteoblastic differentiation . Although OPG attenuated Forskolin-induced osteoclastic differentiation , thus confirming similar reports by Mabilleau et al. 10 , Tseng et al. reported that calcification was not abrogated by OPG and concluded that pathways different from RANKL OPG signaling were implicated . This is not sur-prising because murine models of calcification , and like-wise , atherosclerotic calcification , may involve different pathways than in humans . However , we provide evidence for the direct involvement of RANKL OPG in human MAC as typified in CN . In summary , patients with CN have high levels of in-flammatory cytokines potentially modulating the RANKL OPG signaling pathway . They further display elevated systemic serum RANKL levels and high RANKL OPG ratio , driving VSMCs into an osteoblastic differentiation pathway , resulting in deposition of a mineralized matrix in vitro . Differentiation of VSMCs occurs via the RANKL RANK signaling cascade , setting intracellular mechanisms involving the nuclear translocation of NF-kB . This study provides additional data demonstrating that MAC in CN is independent of the high calcium-phosphate microenvi-ronment . Furthermore , OPG is shown to prevent nuclear translocation of NF-kB and abrogate differentiation and mineralization of VSMCs induced by RANKL or Charcot serum . On the basis of the findings from this study , a working model of MAC as occurs in patients with CN is proposed Fig. 7 . When interpreted in the light of other studies confirming the crucial role of RANKL OPG signaling in osteoclastic bone resorption 10 , our data provide a potential unifying hypothesis for the underlying pathogenetic mechanisms resulting in diabetic CN . Abnormal RANKL OPG signaling , therefore , may be proposed as the mechanism underpinning the paradoxical osteolysis and MAC seen in CN and similar disease conditions . This holds promise for the treatment of CN , especially because new drugs specifically targeting RANKL are already marketed for use in osteoporosis . Clini-cal trials are warranted to assess the efficacy of anti-RANKL therapy in the treatment or prevention of CN and vascular calcification .

21668587	113-8613 , Japan Introduction The transcription and processing of ribosomal RNA rRNA genes and ribosome biogenesis are carried out within the nucleolus of eukaryotic cells . Mamma-lian rRNA gene transcription is regulated by upstream binding factor UBF , transcription initiation factor IA TIF-IA , selectivity factor 1 SL1 complex and RNA polymerase I during the cell cycle , and activated by serum stimulation Russell Zomerdijk 2005 . In addition , rRNA gene transcription is con-trolled by other transcriptional factors in response to nutrients or growth factors . For example , cAMP-responsive element-binding protein CREB -binding protein CBP and c-MYC stimulate rRNA gene transcription , whereas Rb and p53 block it Pelletier Communicated by Kozo Kaibuchi *Correspondence koiwaitm @ rs.noda.tus.ac.jp domain 103–133 residues and another DNA-binding domain homologous to HMG B DBD , 578–630 residues . TdIF2 has a typical nuclear local-ization signal , i.e. , 631-KKRRK , and localizes in the nucleus . Tip60 was first identified as a 60-kDa protein asso-ciated with HIV Tat Kamine et al. 1996 . Alternative splicing results in the expression of three splicing vari-ants Tip60 isoforms 1 , 2 and 3 . Tip60 isoform 2 has been well characterized and is referred to here as Tip60 . It consists of 513 amino acids , contains an N-terminal chromodomain and C-terminal conserved MYST MOZ , YBF2 ? SAS3 , SAS2 and Tip60 domain and forms a protein complex in vivo Cai et al. 2003 , 2005 Sapountzi et al. 2006 . Tip60 belongs to the MYST family of histone acetyltrans-ferases HATs and acetylates the core histone H2A at position Lys5 , H3 at position Lys14 and H4 at posi-tions Lys5 , Lys8 , Lys12 and Lys16 in vitro , but does not acetylate H2B Yamamoto Horikoshi 1997 Kimura Horikoshi 1998 . Tip60 also binds to his-tone deacetylase HDAC 7 , and this complex nega-tively regulates the transcription of target genes by binding to CREB , zinc finger E box-binding protein or signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 STAT3 Gavaravarapu Kamine 2000 Hlubek et al. 2001 Xiao et al. 2003 . The Tip60 yeast homologue Esa1p acetylates H2A , H3 and H4 and functions in rRNA gene silencing . Yeast mutants of esa1 display rRNA gene-silencing defects , show structural disruption of the nucleolus and accumulate in the G2 ? M phase Clarke et al. 1999 , 2006 . In contrast , Tip60 positively regulates p53-mediated p21 and puma transcription and induces apoptosis Tang et al. 2006 . Tip60 is also involved in rRNA gene transcription through UBF acetylation within the nucleolus in a prostate cancer cell line Halkidou et al. 2003 . In addition , Tip60 plays an important role in the DNA damage response . IR or UV irradiation or DNA double-strand breaks induce the transcription of Tip60’s target genes as well as the stabilization of the Tip60 protein , the activation of its HAT activity and its translocation to promyelocytic leukemia bodies Legube et al. 2002 Kusch et al. 2004 Sun et al. 2005 , 2007 Eymin et al. 2006 Ikura et al. 2007 Bhoumik et al. 2008 Cheng et al. 2008 Wu et al. 2009 . Here , we show that TdIF2 localizes within the nucleolus and promotes the transcriptional activity of the human ribosomal RNA gene promoter hrD-NAP . Furthermore , we show that TdIF2 binds directly to Tip60 to suppress Tip60’s HAT activity . Multiple sequence alignments of TdIF2 orthologs We previously isolated a human cDNA encoding TdIF2 as a TdT-binding protein , using the yeast two-hybrid system Fujita et al. 2003 . Here , we searched for the amino acid sequences of TdIF2 orthologs from the NCBI nonredundant database using a PSI-BLAST search and found homologues in species ranging from the yeast Schizosaccharomyces pom-be to higher vertebrates . Figure S1 in Supporting Information shows several amino acid sequence align-ments of TdIF2 orthologs . The sequence correspond-ing to the human TdIF2 C-terminus from residues 563 to 756 was conserved from yeast to human , whereas that corresponding to the N-terminal region residues 1–562 was conserved only in vertebrates and was more diverse even among these species . Human TdIF2 had a high degree of total amino acid sequence homology with the TdIF2s of other verte-brates 81 % for Mus musculus , 74 % for opossum Monodelphis domestica , and 49 % for Danio rerio and had amino acid sequence similarity at the C-terminus residues 446–756 in human with the TdIF2s of nonvertebrates , including the purple sea urchin , Strongylocentrotus purpuratus 41 % , a fruit fly , Drosoph-ila melanogaster 26 % , and a yeast , S. pombe 26 % . Notably , no acidic region , which is present in histone chaperones such as nucleosome assembly protein 1 NAP-1 Ishimi Kikuchi 1991 , was found in any nonvertebrate . These findings indicate that the N-ter-minus residues 1–562 , which includes the acidic region , might have a vertebrate-specific function , whereas the C-terminus might have a function common to all eukaryotes . TdIF2 localizes within the nucleolus The TdIF2 C-terminus shares a high degree of amino acid sequence homology with S. pombe FAF1 co-puri-fying factor 2 Fcf2p Fig. S1 in Supporting Informa-tion , which localizes within the nucleolus Rempola et al. 2006 . Because Fcf2p appeared to be a yeast homologue of human TdIF2 , we first examined whether TdIF2 also localizes within the nucleolus . TdIF2 was observed in HEK 293T cells by immuno-staining using an anti-TdIF2 antibody , under phase-contrast microscopy . As shown in Fig. 1A , endogenous TdIF2 was observed within the nucleolus indicated by arrows . Its localization was confirmed by its co-localization with UBF , a marker protein for the nucleolus , which we labeled with an anti-UBF antibody Fig. 1B . We also observed that an exoge-nous TdIF2 fusion protein i.e. , EGFP-TdIF2 local-ized to the nucleolus in HEK 293T cells Fig. 1C . The localization of the over-expressed EGFP-TdIF2 was consistent with that observed by immunostaining for the endogenous protein , indicating that the N-ter-minal EGFP-tag had no effect on TdIF2’s localization . N-and C-terminal regions of TdIF2 are crucial for its localization within the nucleolus We next sought to elucidate the functional region in TdIF2 that determines its localization . Although no consensus amino acid sequence has been established as a nucleolar localization signal NoLS , several nucleolar proteins , such as HTLV-1 Rex , Tat , and Rev , adenovirus PTP1 and PTP2 , c-Myc , heat-shock protein 70 HSP70 , P120 , parathyroid hormone - related peptide PTHrP , fibroblast growth factor 3 FGF3 , Marek’s disease virus MEQ , RNase P subun-its Rpp38 and Rpp29 , murine double mutate 2 Mdm2 , sirtuin-1 and proline-rich nuclear receptor coregulatory protein , have a lysine-or arginine-rich region K ? R-rich region that localizes them to within the nucleolus Liu et al. 1997 Jarrous et al. 1999 Lohrum et al. 2000 Lechertier et al. 2007 Wang et al. 2011 . Because TdIF2 has K ? R-rich regions in its N-terminus residues 60–70 and 103– 131 and C-terminus residues 631–639 , 707–712 , 726–732 and 746–755 , we reasoned that these regions function to direct TdIF2 to the nucleolus . To examine this possibility , we constructed four TdIF2 truncation mutants i.e. , N-ter1 , N-ter2 , C-ter1 and C-ter2 , shown in Fig. 2A and expressed them in HEK 293T cells . As shown in Fig. 2B , N-ter1 and C-ter2 were localized within the nucleolus , N-ter2 within the cytoplasm and C-ter1 within the entire cell . These findings indicated that two regions in TdIF2 , one in the N-terminus and one in the C-ter-minus residues 1–234 and 606–756 , respectively , serve as NoLS . Isolation of genes whose products bind to TdIF2 in a yeast two-hybrid system Given TdIF2’s localization inside the nucleolus , we reasoned that TdIF2 would bind to other proteins localized there . We sought to isolate genes whose products bound directly to TdIF2 using a yeast two-hybrid system . Thirty-nine candidate clones were iso-lated in the first screening . Among them , we found the nucleolar proteins , Tat interactive protein 60 Tip60 , ribosomal subunit protein S7 and 58-kDa microspherule protein MSP58 ? microspherule pro-tein 1 MCRS1 , strongly supporting our evidence for TdIF2’s localization within the nucleolus Lin Shih 2002 Shimono et al. 2005 Kruger et al. 2007 . TdIF2 promotes rRNA gene promoter activity Because TdIF2 binds to proteins such as Tip60 and MCRS1 that participate in rRNA gene transcription , we suspected that TdIF2 was also involved in rRNA gene transcription . We therefore examined whether TdIF2 affected rRNA gene promoter activity in a luciferase assay system . In this experiment , we used a reporter plasmid , pGL3-hrDNAP-IRES , harboring the human rRNA gene promoter hrDNAP Shimono et al. 2005 . We first determined whether the luciferase gene in pGL3-hrDNAP-IRES was actually transcribed by RNA polymerase I using an inhibitor of RNA polymerase I , Actinomycin D ActD , at low concen-tration . HEK 293T cells were transfected with pGL3-hrDNAP-IRES and a control plasmid , pRL-TK , and then treated with ActD for 6 h , and the Photinus pyralis and Renilla reniformis luciferase activities PA and RA , respectively were assayed . As shown in Fig. 3A , the relative luciferase activity RLA expressed by hrD-NAP was suppressed to 30 % after treatment with ActD , indicating that hrDNAP is really transcribed by RNA polymerase I in HEK 293T cells . We then examined whether TdIF2 affected rRNA gene pro-moter activity using pGL3-hrDNAP-IRES . HEK 293T cells were transfected with pEGFP-C1-TdIF2 , pGL3-hrDNAP-IRES and pRL-TK , and PA and RA were assayed . As shown in Fig. 3B , RLA expressed by hrDNAP with EGFP-TdIF2 over-expression was 4.5 times greater than that in the control . Because TdIF2 did not activate SV40 and GATA promoters , TdIF2 is considered to specifically promote hrDNAP activity . From these and our previous findings that TdIF2 has an acidic region and liberates H2A ? H2B from core histones in concert with TdT and PCNA Fujita et al. 2003 , we suspected that TdIF2 functions in chromatin remodeling within the nucleolus , to regu-late rRNA gene transcription by acting as a histone chaperone . We then confirmed the binding between full-length TdIF2 and the core histones by a GST pull-down assay in vitro , using GST-fused full-length TdIF2 TdIF2 FL as bait and the core histones from calf thymus as prey . The core histones bound to GST-TdIF2 FL as well as to its C-terminus C-ter aa 471–756 Fig. S2 in Supporting Information , sug-gesting that TdIF2 might promote rRNA gene tran-scription by chromatin remodeling . TdIF2 associates with hrDNAP Because TdIF2 promotes hrDNAP activity , we next examined whether TdIF2 associates with hrDNAP , by chromatin immunoprecipitation ChIP assay . We first determined whether TdIF2 binds to nucleosomes in a ChIP assay using an anti-histone H3 antibody . As shown in Fig. S3 in Supporting Information , TdIF2 was detected in the immunoprecipitant , indicating that TdIF2 binds to nucleosomes . Note that the cross-linked core histone was immunoprecipitated and detected at a higher molecular weight than that of Ig heavy chain using an anti-H3 antibody lanes 2 and 3 , indicated by an arrow . We next expressed FLAG-TdIF2 in HEK 293T cells and carried out a ChIP assay using an anti-FLAG antibody . We also carried out a ChIP assay using an anti-UBF antibody as a positive control . The purified DNA from the immunoprecipi-tant was amplified by PCR using an hrDNAP-specific primer set . As shown in Fig. 4 , the hrDNAP region was detected by PCR lane 3 as well as by the ChIP assay , using an anti-UBF antibody lane 4 , indicating that TdIF2 associates with hrDNAP . These and previ-ous results together suggested that TdIF2 promotes hrDNAP activity by associating with a transcriptional regulatory factor such as UBF or by directly binding to the hrDNAP . We therefore examined whether TdIF2 directly binds to hrDNAP encoded in the plasmid pGL3-hrDNAP-IRES , by atomic force microscopy . No direct binding between TdIF2 and hrDNAP was observed data not shown , suggesting that TdIF2 binds to hrDNAP through other proteins , such as UBF or histone , to promote hrDNAP activity . Knockdown of TdIF2 To confirm TdIF2’s promotion of hrDNAP activity , we carried out an RNA interference experiment using TdIF2-specific small interfering RNAs siRNAs in HEK 293T cells . As shown in Fig. 5A , TdIF2 was knocked down from its baseline level of expression by a cocktail of siRNAs at 80 lane 3 , 100 lane 4 and 200 nM lane 5 to 73 % , 12 % and 5 % , respectively . TdIF2 slightly reduced the Tip60 and UBF at 200 nM , suggesting that TdIF2 interacts with these proteins and the loss of TdIF2 by knockdown destabilizes Tip60 and UBF . We next observed the nucleolar formation in TdIF2-knocked-down HEK 293T cells after siRNA transfection . As shown in Fig. 5B , no apparent abnormality was observed in the knocked-down cells circled , solid lines in the nucleolar formation , the size of the nucleoli or the UBF localization , strongly suggesting that TdIF2 is not involved in nucleolar formation . We next investigated the effect of TdIF2 knock-down on hrDNAP activity using the luciferase assay system . HEK 293T cells were transfected with pGL3-hrDNAP-IRES , pRL-TK and a cocktail of TdIF2-specific siRNAs , and the luciferase activities were assayed . As shown in Fig. 5C , the relative luciferase activity expressed by hrDNAP decreased to 65 % of baseline in the presence of 100 nM siRNA . The relative luciferase activity expressed by the SV40 promoter was not noticeably affected by the TdIF2-specific siRNAs . These results support our finding that TdIF2 promotes hrDNAP activity . Interestingly , although 100 nM siRNA decreased the amount of TdIF2 to 10 % , the relative luciferase activity only decreased to 65 % , suggesting that the hrDNAP activation does not depend entirely on TdIF2 . We also confirmed that the level of rRNA was reduced by TdIF2 knockdown by RT-PCR . As shown in Fig. 5D , the pre-rRNA was reduced to 78 % of its original level by the TdIF2 knockdown . Many nucleolar proteins alter their localization after treatment with ActD . RNA polymerase I , UBF , fibrillarin , Nopp140 and RasL11a migrate from the nucleolus to the perinucleolar cap structure Jordan et al. 1996 Chen et al. 1999 Lechertier et al. 2009 Pistoni et al. 2010 , nucleolin and ribosomal proteins to spherical component Kruger et al. 2007 Pistoni et al. 2010 , and B23 ? nucleophosmin , UTP18 and Pes1 to the nucleoplasm by ActD treatment Holzel et al. 2010 Yao et al. 2010 . We suspected that TdIF2 also alter its localization by ActD treatment . HEK 293T cells were treated with 0.050 lg ? mL ActD and TdIF2 were observed under fluorescent microscopy using anti-TdIF2 and anti-UBF antibod-ies . As shown in Fig. 6A , TdIF2 was localized within the perinucleolar region and the nucleoplasm . We also checked the amount of TdIF2 in HEK 293T cells during 12 h after ActD treatment . As shown in Fig. 6B , the amount of TdIF2 in the cells was not affected by ActD treatment . These results indicate that TdIF2 within the nucleolus migrates to the peri-nucleolar region and the nucleoplasm by ActD treat-ment . This alteration of TdIF2 localization by ActD treatment is similar to nucleolar histone chaperone B23 or rRNA processing factors UTP18 and Pes1 , suggesting that TdIF2 regulates rRNA transcription through chromatin remodeling and ? or rRNA pro-cessing . TdIF2 and Tip60 co-localize within the nucleolus We next examined the molecular mechanism by which TdIF2 promotes the hrDNAP activity . Because , among the TdIF2-binding proteins identi-fied by yeast two-hybrid screening , Tip60 is deeply involved in rRNA gene regulation Halkidou et al. 2003 , we focused on elucidating the function of the binding between TdIF2 and Tip60 . The Tip60 yeast homologue Esa1p acetylates H2A , H3 and H4 and functions in rRNA gene silencing Clarke et al. 2006 . Moreover , Tip60 is localized within the nucleolus of LNCaP cells , a prostate cancer cell line Halkidou et al. 2003 . We first examined the TdIF2 and Tip60 localization in HEK 293T cells under con-focal laser microscopy . As shown in Fig. 1D , TdIF2 and Tip60 co-localized mainly within the nucleolus in HEK 293T cells . Binding between TdIF2 and Tip60 From the findings that TdIF2 binds to Tip60 in yeast cells and co-localizes with Tip60 within the nucleo-lus , we suspected that TdIF2 binds directly to Tip60 . To examine the direct binding between TdIF2 and Tip60 , we first carried out an in vitro GST pull-down assay using GST-TdIF2 and His-Tip60 as the bait and prey , respectively . As shown in Fig. 7A , His-Tip60 precipitated together with GST-TdIF2-bound beads lane 1 , but not with GST-bound beads lane 2 . To confirm the association between TdIF2 and Tip60 in HEK 293T cells , we carried out a co-immunoprecip-itation assay using an anti-Tip60 antibody as the bait . As shown in Fig. 7B , TdIF2 was detected in the immunoprecipitant , indicating that it associates with Tip60 in vivo . As Tip60 binds to UBF Halkidou et al. 2003 , we further examined whether UBF was present in the immunoprecipitant using an anti-UBF antibody . As shown in Fig. 7B , UBF was also detected in the immunoprecipitant , indicating that TdIF2 , Tip60 and UBF form a protein complex in vivo . These results strongly suggest that TdIF2 is involved in rRNA gene transcription together with Tip60 and UBF . TdIF2 suppresses Tip60 histone acetyltransferase HAT activity As TdIF2 binds to Tip60 , which has HAT activity Cai et al. 2003 , 2005 , we next asked whether TdIF2 affects the Tip60 HAT activity . We purified His-Tip60 with a nickel column Fig. 8A , lane 2 and then examined whether the purified His-Tip60 had HAT activity . Core histones , His-Tip60 and acetyl-CoA were mixed and incubated . As shown in Fig. 8B , the purified His-Tip60 had HAT activity . We next carried out HAT assays in which His-Tip60 was mixed with various amounts of purified GST or GST-TdIF2 FL . The purified GST-TdIF2 FL was detected in 158 kDa on the gel Fig. 8A , lane 1 because of TdIF2’s structural property , although esti-mated molecular weight of GST-TdIF2 FL is 110 kDa . As shown in Fig. 8C , the amount of core histones acetylated by His-Tip60 was reduced in the presence of GST-TdIF2 FL , indicating that TdIF2 suppresses Tip60 HAT activity . Recombinant Tip60 acetylates the core histone H2A at position Lys5 , H3 at position Lys14 and H4 at positions Lys5 , Lys8 , Lys12 and Lys16 in vitro but does not H2B Yamam-oto Horikoshi 1997 Kimura Horikoshi 1998 . As the core histone acetylated with His-Tip60 gener-ally reduced in the presence of GST-TdIF2 FL , TdIF2 is considered to prevent the histone acetylation by Tip60 at all of the acetylation sites . During the acetylation experiments using Tip60 and TdIF2 , we observed that TdIF2 is also acetylated by Tip60 data not shown and Tip60 is auto-acetylated in vitro Fig. 8B . Two molecular inhibitor of HAT INHAT enti-ties have been reported . One is an INHAT complex that contains a leucine-rich acidic nuclear protein LANP , also known as ANP32-A , PHAPI or pp32 and inhibits H3 and H4 acetylation by PCAF and p300 ? CBP . This LANP INHAT complex also down-regulates the neurofilament light chain NF-L gene expression Seo et al. 2001 Kular et al. 2009 . The other INHAT is Proline - , glutamic acid-and leu - cine-rich protein 1 PELP1 , which also suppresses the histone acetylation by p300 ? CBP , by masking histone and HDAC2 recruitment . PELP1 up-regu-lates ER-mediated transcription but down-regulates GR - , Nur77 - , AP1 - , NF-jB-and TCF ? SRF-medi-ated transcription Choi et al. 2004 . Thus , TdIF2 appears to be a third INHAT protein in addition to LANP and PELP1 . TdIF2 suppresses the down-regulation by Tip60 As TdIF2 associates with Tip60 to suppress its HAT activity , we next examined whether TdIF2 affected hrDNAP activity when co-expressed with Tip60 in HEK 293T cells , using a luciferase assay system . As shown in Fig. 9 , although over-expressed DsRed-Tip60 decreased the relative luciferase gene transcrip-tion to 75 % , when EGFP-TdIF2 was co-expressed with DsRed-Tip60 the luciferase gene transcription increased by up to 1.4-or 2.1-fold with increasing EGFP-TdIF2 expression . These results suggest that TdIF2 promotes hrDNAP activity by associating with over-expressed or endogenous Tip60 , to suppress Tip60’s down-regulation of hrDNAP . Although Tip60-mediated histone acetylation is reported to up-or down-regulate the transcription of specific genes Gavaravarapu Kamine 2000 Hlubek et al. 2001 Xiao et al. 2003 , whether Tip60 up-or down-regu-lates rRNA gene transcription has been unknown . Our results suggest that Tip60 solely down-regulates the hrDNAP activity . We further determined that the effect of Tip60 on hrDNAP activity is dose depen-dent . The activity was reduced to 30 % of the original level with increasing Tip60 Fig. S4 in Supporting Information . TdIF2 promotes UBF acetylation When we carried out a co-immunoprecipitation assay using an anti-Tip60 antibody as the bait , UBF was detected in the immunoprecipitant together with TdIF2 Fig. 7B . These results strongly suggested that TdIF2 , Tip60 and UBF form a protein complex in vivo . We therefore addressed whether TdIF2 is involved in UBF acetylation by TdIF2 knockdown in HEK 293T cells . UBF in the TdIF2-knocked-down cells was immunoprecipitated using an anti-UBF anti-body , and acetylated UBF was detected by immuno-blotting using an anti-acetyl-lysine antibody . As shown in Fig. 10A , UBF acetylation was reduced by TdIF2 knockdown lane 2 , suggesting that TdIF2 promotes UBF acetylation . We then examined whether TdIF2 promotes UBF acetylation by TdIF2 over-expression in HEK 293T cells . As shown in Fig. 10B , TdIF2 pro-moted UBF acetylation , supporting the results by TdIF2 knockdown . Our previous and these results suggest that TdIF2 is involved in up-regulation of rRNA gene promoter activity by suppressing histone acetylation with Tip60 and by promoting UBF acety-lation . Discussion We have shown that TdIF2 localizes within the nucleolus , promotes hrDNAP activity , directly binds Tip60 to suppress Tip60 HAT activity and promotes UBF acetylation . TdIF2 was originally identified as a TdT-binding protein . TdIF2 binds to core histones and liberates H2A and H2B in the presence of TdT and PCNA . Therefore , we initially suspected that TdIF2 functions in the chromatin remodeling of N region synthesis during V D J recombination Fujita et al. 2003 . However , we found that eukaryotes that lack an immune system have TdIF2 orthologs and that TdIF2 was localized within the nucleolus . In addition , we isolated a cDNA encoding Tip60 , which functions as a regulatory factor in rRNA gene transcription within the nucleolus , as a TdIF2-binding protein by yeast two-hybrid screening . The findings that TdIF2 co-localizes with Tip60 within nucleoli and promotes hrDNAP activity indicated that TdIF2 plays a role in rRNA gene transcription as well as in DNA synthesis . Thus , TdIF2 might function as a chromatin remodel-ing factor in both rRNA gene transcription and N region synthesis . Recently , TdIF2 was reported to be an estrogen receptor ER a-binding protein ERBP Bu et al. 2004 . ERa is a transcription factor that localizes within the nucleolus and stimulates ER-responsive gene transcription in a 17b-estradiol estrogen-depen-dent manner Cheskis et al. 1997 . Estrogen induces rRNA gene transcription in rat pituitary cells Ying et al. 1996 . These facts and our finding that TdIF2 promotes hrDNAP activity strongly suggest that estrogen induces ERa ? TdIF2-mediated rRNA gene transcription . Similarly , androgen binds to the andro-gen receptor , induces Tip60 to be loaded onto the rRNA gene promoter and regulates rRNA gene tran-scription Gaughan et al. 2002 Halkidou et al. 2003 . Because TdIF2 associates with UBF and Tip60 , androgen is thought to induce UBF ? Tip60 ? TdIF2-mediated rRNA gene transcription in prostate cancer cells . It would be interesting to examine whether TdIF2 or Tip60 actually participates in rRNA gene transcription in prostate cancer cells and pituitary cells , respectively . In addition to Tip60 , we isolated the MCRS1 gene with a product as a TdIF2-binding protein , by a yeast two-hybrid system . From the pre-vious finding that MCRS1 can increase transcription from the rRNA gene promoter by 200 % Shimono et al. 2005 , TdIF2 is likely to promote hrDNAP activity by binding directly to MCRS1 , UBF and Tip60 . Histone acetylation has been associated with the up-regulation of rRNA gene transcription Hirschler-Laszkiewicz et al. 2001 Grummt Pikaard 2003 Tsang et al. 2003 Grandori et al. 2005 . However , the Tip60 yeast homologue Esa1p functions in rRNA gene silencing and down-regulates ribosomal gene transcription Clarke et al. 1999 , 2006 Reid et al. 2000 . The Drosophila Tip60 complex has also been suggested to promote the generation of silent chro-matin Qi et al. 2006 . Thus , histone acetylation by Tip60 or Esa1p does not correlate with the up-regu-lation of gene transcription . p300 ? CBP acetylates UBP to facilitate rRNA gene transcription Pelletier et al. 2000 . Although Tip60 acetylates UBF , no evidence has been reported whether the acetylated UBF by Tip60 promotes rRNA gene transcription . From our findings that TdIF2 promotes UBF acetylation Fig. 10 , we can propose two possible mechanisms for UBP acetylation by Tip60 and rRNA gene transcription . One is that Tip60 acetylates UBF to enhance rRNA gene tran-scription . Given that TdIF2 suppresses and promotes Tip60’s acetyltransferase activity for histone and UBP , respectively . The other is that Tip60 acetylates UBF to down-regulate rRNA gene transcription . In this case , TdIF2 suppresses UBF acetylation by Tip60 as well as histones however , TdIF2 stimulates the acety-lation activity of p300 ? CBP to acetylate UBF higher level than that by Tip60 . We should determine whether TdIF2 really promotes p300 ? CBP’s and ? or Tip60’s acetyltransferase activity for UBF . From the results that Tip60 solely down-regulates the rRNA gene promoter activity Fig. 9 and Fig. S4 in Sup-porting Information , we suspect that Tip60 acetylates histone to facilitate the generation of silent chromatin before entering the stage of pre-initiation complex formation including RNA polymerase I and down-regulates the rRNA gene promoter activity . 1A6 ? down-regulated in metastasis DRIM is a dual-functional nucleolar protein that functions in 18S rRNA processing and rRNA gene transcription Wang et al. 2007 . The TdIF2 C-terminus shares a high amino acid sequence homology with S. pombe Fcf2p Fig. S1 in Supporting Information , which functions in 48S pre-rRNA processing Rempola et al. 2006 , strongly suggesting that TdIF2 not only promotes rRNA gene transcription but also partici-pates in rRNA processing as 1A6 ? DRIM . The migra-tion of TdIF2 to the nucleoplasm after ActD treatment Fig. 6A as well as pre-RNA processing factors UTP18 and Pes1 Holzel et al. 2010 also sup-ports our speculation . Tip60 was first identified as an HIV-1 Tat-inter-acting protein . Tat is an RNA-binding protein that is essential for viral replication and regulates productive and processive transcription Loret et al. 1992 Liang Wainberg 2002 . Tat localizes within the nucleo-lus , inhibits the Tip60 HAT activity and stimulates Tip60 degradation Dang Lee 1989 Col et al. 2005 . Tat disrupts rRNA processing , reduces the 80S ribosome level and leads to pre-rRNA accumula-tion Tollervey et al. 1993 Ponti et al. 2008 . Thus , Tat might negatively regulate rRNA synthesis by binding to Tip60 within the nucleolus . From the speculations that TdIF2 might function in rRNA processing , it is possible that Tat disrupts rRNA pro-cessing by inhibiting the TdIF2 function . That is , Tat might directly bind to both Tip60 and TdIF2 to abolish their function and eventually disrupt rRNA processing . We are currently examining whether Tat in fact binds to TdIF2 . In summary , we have shown that TdIF2 localizes within the nucleolus , promotes hrDNAP activity and directly binds to Tip60 to suppress the Tip60 HAT activity . The N-terminal residues 1–234 and C-ter-minal residues 606–756 regions in TdIF2 are crucial for its nucleolar localization . It is still necessary to clarify the functional role of TdIF2 in rRNA process-ing within the nucleolus in vivo .

21679745	Eosinophil granulocytes are part of our innate immunity and are known for their bactericidal , helminthotoxic , and antiviral activity and damage to body tissues in disease [ 1 ] . Eosinophils are associated with inflammatory response in many tumors , where they can have two fundamentally different functions [ 2 ] they may limit tumor growth by their destructive functions , which include recruitment and activation of other leukocytes or they may be immunoreg-ulatory and remodeling cells that suppress immune responses and promote tumor cell proliferation . How the balance is maintained between these two opposite functions in tumors is unknown . Classical Hodgkin lymphoma HL is characterized by the presence of a few malignant Hodgkin and Reed Stern-berg HRS cells among an abundance of inflammatory cells , including eosinophils [ 3 ] . In HL , interactions between tumor cells and inflammatory cells are important for tumor progression , which is achieved through direct cell-to-cell contacts and or cytokine signaling [ 4 ] . In most cases , HRS cells are of B-cell origin , however , T-cell derived HL also exists [ 5 ] . HRS cells of B-cell origin have downre-gulate many of their B-cell surface receptors , including CD20 [ 6,7 ] . In contrast , HRS cells almost always express CD30 , a tumor necrosis factor receptor family member , known to provide stimulatory signals either through autoac-tivation or cell-to-cell contacts [ 8 ] . Eosinophils and mast cells surrounding HRS cells express the ligand for CD30 CD30L in vivo and could therefore possibly stimulate proliferation of the tumor cells [ 9–11 ] . Twenty percent of HL cases show prominent tumor eosinophilia [ 12 ] , and patients with HL tumors heavily infiltrated with eosinophils have a poorer prognosis than those with few eosinophils , according to some studies [ 12,13 ] . Eosinophils mediate their immune function via degranu-lation and production of various mediators . Examples of proteins stored in the granules are eosinophil cationic protein ECP , a cytotoxic pore-forming membrane-desta-bilizing protein [ 14 ] , and eosinophil protein X EPX , also called eosinophil-derived neurotoxin , a protein with strong ribonuclease RNase activity . The majority 60 % of HL patients have elevated serum concentrations of ECP S-ECP , and high S-ECP levels correlate to negative prog-nostic factors [ 15 ] . High S-ECP also correlates to tumor eosinophilia , indicating that these eosinophils produce ECP . It has not yet been investigated how HRS cells sustain proliferation in the presence of ECP . A coding polymorphism in the ECP gene rs2073342 results in an amino acid substitution from arginine to thre-onine at position 97 . Among a Scandinavian population , the genotype corresponding to the ECP97arg variant of the protein was found to be common [ 16 ] , and this protein has cytotoxic properties in model systems in contrast to the noncytotoxic activities of ECP97thr [ 17 ] . Also , the substitution from arginine to threonine theoretically creates a new glycosylation site for either O-linked glyco-sylation to the hydroxyl group of threonine or N-linked glycosylation to the asparagine in the Asn-X-Thr sequence [ 18 ] . A lower level of glycosylation of ECP97arg potenti-ates the cytotoxic properties of ECP on a small-cell lung cancer SCLC cell line NCI-H69 [ 17 ] . In addition to its cytotoxic activity , ECP is involved in the development of fibrosis in various diseases [ 19,20 ] . The ECP97arg protein contributes more in terms of fibrosis in Schisto-soma mansoni infection than ECP97thr [ 21 ] . ECP has a suspected role in fibrosis in HL , indicated by a correla-tion between high serum levels and nodular sclerosis HL [ 15 ] . Because ECP has cytotoxic properties , but eosinophilia and high S-ECP levels in HL appear to stimulate tumor progression and are associated with negative prognostic factors , the aim was to investigate how ECP affects HRS cells in vitro . More precisely , we aim to investigate if ECP is cytotoxic or has stimulatory functions on cultured HRS cells . These results were then compared to the previ-ously studied SCLC cell line with regard to the effects of ECP [ 17,22 ] . Materials and methods Cell culture The HL cell lines used were HDLM-2 of T-cell origin no . ACC17 DSMZ , Braunschweig , Germany [ 23,24 ] , and two cell lines of B-cell origin , L428 and KMH2 [ 25–28 ] . Cells were cultured in RPMI Sigma-Aldrich , St Louis , MO , USA supplemented with 10 % heat-inactivated fetal calf serum , 2 nM glutamine , 100 U mL penicillin , and 100 mg mL streptomycin , all from Sigma Aldrich . ECP purification Native ECP was purified from healthy blood donors genotyped for the 434 GOC polymorphism , as described [ 17 ] . In short , eosinophil granules were collected from the buffy coats of donors with the ECP434GG genotype ECP97arg . After granule extrac-tion , the granule extracts were purified by gel filtration chromatog-raphy using a Sephadex G-75 superfine column GE Healthcare Biosciences , Uppsala , Sweden calibrated with 0.2 M NaAc pH 4.5 . The eluted proteins were pooled into 10 pools , of which 2 contained ECP the first pool contained high molecular weight HMW ECP and the second low molecular weight LMW ECP . These two ECP-containing pools were further purified sepa-rately by ion-exchange chromatography using the AKTAprime€ system and a Mono-S column GE Healthcare Biosciences equil-ibrated with 50 mM MES Merck , Darmstadt , Germany , 2 % betaine Sigma-Aldrich , and 0.1 M LiCl pH 6.0 Merck . Proteins were eluted with a linear gradient from 0.1 to 2.0 M LiCl pH 6.0 . The eluted fractions were pooled and ECP purifica-tion from donors with the ECP434GG genotype resulted in a total of nine ECP-containing pools , HMW-ECP I V and LMW-ECP I IV . The roman numerals correspond to the different ion-exchange chromatography pools , where ‘‘I’’ is the first eluted pool and also the most glycosylated . As the amounts of ECP obtained by these procedures are limited , five ECP pools with relatively high protein concentrations were selected for the functional testing HMW-ECP I , HMW-ECP IV , HMW-ECP V , LMW-ECP II , and LMW-ECP IV . All chosen ECP pools were analyzed with a surface-enhanced laser desorp-tion ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry SELDI-TOF MS assay described in [ 29 ] to monitor the molecular weight and level of glycosylation of the different ECP variants . To obtain ECP97thr , ECP was also purified from subjects with the ECP434GC genotype ECP97arg thr . As demonstrated in [ 17 ] the first ion-exchange chromatography pool of the LMW-ECP from ECP434GC donors contains O95 % of the ECP97thr variant . This ECP pool was referred to as ECP97thr . During the purification procedure of ECP , native EPX is also isolated . EPX elutes before ECP in the ion-exchange chromatography . Fluorometric microculture cytotoxicity assay A cell assay was used to measure the survival index SI of cells after culture with native ECP or EPX . Cells were washed twice with serum-free RPMI serum inactivates ECP . Cells were counted and seeded into 96-well microtiter plates , 10,000 cells well . ECP was diluted in 0.2 M NaAc buffer pH 5.5 in a volume of 20 mL and was added in duplicate samples to the plates . ECP concentrations ranged from 0.004 to 1.14 mM for HDLM-2 , from 0.004 to 0.57 mM for L428 and 0.018 to 0.57 mM for KMH2 . EPX diluted in 0.2 M NaAc buffer pH 5.5 was tested in one concentration , 0.14 mM , on all cell lines . Eight wells con-taining 0.2 M NaAc buffer and cells served as controls . As a posi-tive control for cytotoxicity , 0.01 % Triton X-100 was used . Plates were incubated at 37 C , in 5 % CO2 for 72 hours and were then washed with phosphate-buffered saline before the addition of 10 mg mL fluorescein diacetate FDA Sigma-Aldrich . Plates were incubated for 40 minutes at 37 C , 5 % CO2 before reading the fluo-rescence with filters set at 485 nm for excitation and 538 nm for emission Fluorescan 2 Labsystem OY , Helsinki , Finland , according to the fluorometric microculture cytotoxicity assay described in [ 30 ] . The fluorescence generated is proportional to the number of cells in the well with an intact plasma membrane , and data are presented as % SI , which is calculated as follows difference in SI at fixed concentrations and between the different cell lines was calculated by t-test . To establish the breakpoint of the curve for HDLM-2 when different ECP concentrations were compared , the contrast between adjacent concentrations was Criteria for a successful assay included a fluorescent signal in the control wells of more than five times mean blank values . All experiments for all ECP variants and EPX were performed in duplicate and repeated at least twice . Preparation of cells for continued cell culture HDLM-2 cells were washed and seeded in serum-free RPMI medium into 24-well plates , 60,000 cells per well . Cells were either cultured with 0.07 mM ECP in 0.2 M NaAc buffer ECP-treated cells or with 0.2 M NaAc buffer only buffer-treated cells for 72 hours in 37 C , 5 % CO2 . After incubation , plates were centrifuged and the serum-free medium was removed . New medium with serum was added and the cells were cultured monitored and photographed daily for an additional 72 hours . Flow cytometry HDLM-2 cells were prepared and seeded as described above . After 72 hours incubation , cells were retrieved from the wells by careful pipetting , washed once with fluorescence-activated cell sorting FACS buffer 1 phosphate-buffered saline , 0.1 % bovine serum albumin , and counted under a light microscope . Staining for cell surface markers Ten to twenty thousand cells were incubated for 30 minutes on ice , in the dark with FDA , or for 15 minutes with propidium iodide PI and fluorescein isothiocyanate FITC labeled Annexin V Beckman Coulter Inc. , Fullerton , CA , USA or for 30 minutes with a phycoerythrin PE -labeled anti-CD30 antibody Beckman Coulter and the corresponding irrelevant antibody . After incuba-tion , cells were washed twice with ice-cold FACS-buffer . For all experiments , cells were stored on ice , in the dark , until analysis . Analysis by flow cytometry The flow cytometer used was a Cytomics FC500 MPL Beckman Coulter . Five to ten thousand cells were counted and analyzed in each sample . Cells were gated by their forward and side scatter properties and using fluorescence channel 1 FDA and Annexin VFITC , channel 2 CD30PE , or channel 4 PI . Cell viability was measured as a percentage of cells stained with FDA measuring metabolism of cells with intact plasma membrane . Cell death was analyzed by DNA staining PI and staining of phosphatidylserine on the cell surface Annexin V . These data are presented as a percentage of living cells , and as a percentage of Annexin V and PI-positive cells , respectively . CD30 was used as a positive marker of HDLM-2 cells . For all analyses , compari-sons between ECP-and buffer-treated cells were performed . Statistical methods Repeated measures analysis of variance ANOVA was used to test differences in cytotoxicity of ECP between the cell lines . The analyzed . This contrast analysis was by planned comparisons of least squares means , in a repeated measures ANOVA . Due to the experimental design not all concentrations tested in the same experiment , concentrations between 0.004 and 0.57 mM were tested in one analysis , and concentrations between 0.57 and 1.14 mM were tested in another . All concentrations for ECP-treated cells were compared with non ECP-treated cells by Wilcoxon’s matched pair test . Differences in percent positive cells in ECP-and buffer-treated cells for the flow cytometry results were calculated by t-test . p 0.05 was considered significant . Results ECP purification The six ECP pools selected for functional testing were analyzed by SELDI-TOF MS. Figure 1 displays the spectra of the six ECP pools , the peak of highest peak intensity is labeled in each spectrum . All six ECP pools contained several different molecular species of ECP with different degrees of glycosylation . Several of the molecular species were present in more than one pool . Molecular weights varied from approximately 17.79 to 15.90 kDa , HMW-ECP I was the most glycosylated and HMW-ECP V and LMW-ECP IV were the least glycosylated pools . Fluorometric microculture cytotoxicity assay The cytotoxic effect of LMW-ECP II , in the concentration range of 0 to 0.57 mM on the three cell lines is shown in Figure 2 . All cell lines were sensitive to ECP but to various degrees . At low concentrations of ECP , HDLM-2 was more sensitive than the L428 and particularly the KMH2 cell lines inset Fig. 2 . At higher concentrations the opposite was seen , with a more pronounced reduction in SI for L428 and KMH2 as compared to HDLM-2 , where a plateau effect was seen . The cytotoxicity of ECP on the three cell lines differed significantly at all concentrations tested p 0.05 , repeated measures ANOVA with the exception of 0.07 mM . The toxic effect of ECP on KMH2 and L428 was similar to the effect on the SCLC cell line NCI-H69 [ 17 ] . The IC50 value for NCI-H69 was approximately 0.29 mM and for KMH2 and L428 with a similar ECP sample LMW-ECP II , approximately 0.2 and 0.15 mM , respectively . The IC50 was never reached for HDLM-2 . For HDLM-2 , a reduction in SI was evident at the lowest ECP concentration tested , 0.004 mM p 0.01 , Wilcoxon . At a concentration of 0.018 mM , a plateau in SI of about 70 % was reached . No statistically significant difference was determined from the concentration of 0.018 mM ECP and the higher ECP concentrations ECP up to 1.14 mM added , thus showing a true plateau . In total , 13 different ECP samples were tested in a dose-response manner on HDLM-2 , and all samples displayed very similar cytotoxicity . The glycosylation level of ECP did not affect the cyto-toxicity on the HDLM-2 cell line Table 1 . In contrast , KMH2 and L428 cells were more sensitive to ECP with a lower glycosylation degree HMW-ECP IV than to highly glycosylated ECP HMW-ECP I , and L428 was significantly more sensitive than KMH2 p 5 0.004 , t-test . Previous cytotoxicity experiments on NCI-H69 demonstrated that the gene product ECP97arg of the coding ECP 434 GOC polymorphism is toxic , while ECP97thr is nontoxic [ 17 ] . Since HDLM-2 responded similarly to all hitherto tested ECP variants , we also tested an ECP97thr sample on this cell line . The mean SI of ECP97thr at 0.14 mM was 68.3 % 6 1.9 % as compared to 68.4 % 6 1.4 % for LMW-ECP II an ECP97arg pool of similar glycosylation degree . Hence , the sensitivity to ECP vari-ants of the HDLM-2 cell line is very different from the other HL cell lines investigated here , and the previously investigated NCI-H69 . To exclude the possibility that the reduction in SI was due to an RNase effect , EPX , with an RNase activity approximately 100 times higher than ECP , was tested at 0.14 mM . The L428 cell line was insensitive to EPX the SI was 99.5 % 6 4.4 % , but there was a reduction in SI for KMH2 cells , 64.6 % 6 6.3 % . For HDLM-2 a small reduction in SI was seen , 89.3 % 6 6.0 % , which would indi-cate that this cell line is also generally insensitive to EPX . Whether the reduction in SI on KMH2 cells after EPX treatment is due to an RNase effect or reflects a general sensitivity to a highly charged protein is unknown . In an additional experiment HDLM-2 cells were incu-bated with or without ECP LMW-ECP II at 0.07 mM for 72 hours , after which new serum-containing medium without ECP was added . Figure 3 shows HDLM-2 cells first after 72 hours of incubation with ECP , and then after an additional 72 hours of culture with serum . The cells continued to grow in an apparently exponential fashion after serum was added this indicated that ECP caused no injury to the surviving HDLM-2 cells that affected their proliferation . Flow cytometry of HDLM-2 cells To investigate the survival of HDLM-2 cells after ECP incubation with another assay , the viability of ECP-LMW-ECP II at 0.07 mM and buffer-treated HDLM-2 cells was investigated by flow cytometry . All cells were positive for CD30 , a marker for HDLM-2 cells . FDA assay . Cell survival , measured as FDA metabolism , decreased in ECP-treated HDLM-2 cells , compared to buffer-treated cells . When ungated cells were analyzed , the total number of cells positive for FDA was 18.5 % 6 1.7 % after ECP treatment , and 32.8 % 6 2.3 % for buffer-treated cells p 5 0.02 t-test , n 5 3 . The relative difference in viable cells between ECP-treated cells and buffer-treated cells was 43 % [ 32.8 18.5 ] 32.8 100 . Annexin V PI . Annexin V-negative and PI-negative cells cells considered still alive were seen in 17.2 % 6 1.6 % of the ungated cells for the ECP-treated cell population and in 32.0 % 6 8.4 % in the buffer-treated cell population p 5 0.03 , t-test , n 5 4 . The relative difference between ECP-and buffer-treated cells was 46 % [ 32.0 17.2 ] 32.0 100 . Table 2 shows a summary of the cytotoxicity of HMW-ECP II at 0.07 mM on the HDLM-2 cell line , measured with three different methods . For ECP-treated cells 48.6 % 6 9.2 % were solely PI-positive , 0.7 % 6 0.4 % solely Annexin V-positive , and 33.5 % 6 8.7 % were double-positive n 5 4 . Table 1 .

Discussion Despite the fact that the presence of eosinophils in HL tumors is a negative prognostic factor and appears to stim-ulate tumor progression , a cytotoxic effect of ECP was seen when investigating three HL cell lines , HDLM-2 , KMH2 , and L428 , in vitro . ECP was cytotoxic even at low concen-trations however , ECP could not kill all tumor cells , espe-cially not HDLM-2 cells of T-cell origin [ 31 ] . A substantial fraction of those cells remained alive even at comparably high concentrations and a prolonged exposure time 72 hours . For KMH2 and L428 , of B-cell origin , ECP was cytotoxic in a dose-response manner . Variants with less glycosylation displayed more cytotoxicity than more heavily glycosylated variants of KMH2 and L428 , verifying previous findings on the NCI-H69 SCLC cell line [ 17 ] . A study on recombinant variants of the ECP434 GOC polymorphism showed that only the ECP97arg variant was cytotoxic to NCI-H69 however , when the ECP97thr was enzymatically deglycosylated , it regained cytotoxic activity [ 32 ] . Glycosylation seems to have an impact on the cytotoxic activity of ECP . The effect of ECP on HDLM-2 was twofold , a fraction of cells about 30 % stopped metabolizing FDA and were PI-positive.Thesimilarproportionsof nonviablecells seen in the different assays indicated irreversible damage to a frac-tion of cells . In 1986 , Peterson et al. [ 33 ] suggested the occurrence of irreversible damage to cultured lymphocytes at the same low concentrations that inhibited the HDLM-2 cell line . The surviving cell population seemed unaffected by ECP because removal of ECP allowed it to expand normally . Because of this observed plateau phenomenon , different ECP variants were investigated for HDLM-2 for adeeperunderstandingofits effects . However , no differences in cytotoxicity between ECP97arg and ECP97thr or between differently glycosylated ECP variants were seen . Thus , the action of ECP on HDLM-2 is obviously different from the action on the other tested cell lines . EPX , known to be a more potent RNase than ECP , did not have any , or very limited , activity on the HDLM-2 cell line , which excluded an RNase effect as the cause of the SI reduction . Recently , studies investigated different side populations in HL cell lines have been presented [ 34–36 ] . A side population that was more resistant to gem-citabine was found in both HDLM-2 and L428 cell prepa-rations [ 36 ] . Such results lend support to our findings of selective resistance of part of the cell population to ECP in the HDLM-2 cell preparation . One possible mechanism of such selectivity could be different sensitivities depending on the cell cycle stage of the cell population . Cells under-going serum deprivation , as in our cytotoxicity experi-ments , tend to arrest in G0 phase [ 37 ] . Perhaps HDLM-2 cells in G0 phase are insensitive to ECP , and only cells in active growth phases are killed by ECP . The capacity of the remaining cells to proliferate after the addition of medium containing serum may be interpreted in either of two ways . One is the reversible injury to the cells by ECP and the repair of the formed pore or , secondly , the fact that the cells in G0 phase are totally resistant and unable to bind ECP . The three HL cell lines are different in many aspects , but they are all derived from pleural fluid from patients with advanced disease stage IV . HDLM-2 and L428 originally presented with nodular sclerosis histology , KMH2 had the histology of mixed cellularity that transformed to lympho-cyte depleted at the time of relapse . HDLM-2 showed T-cell receptor rearrangements T-cell origin , KMH2 showed immunoglobulin rearrangements B-cell origin , and L428 showed rearrangements of both T-cell receptor and immu-noglobulin which may point to an immature lymphoid origin , considered as B-cell origin . The doubling time for HDLM-2 is 70 to 75 hours , for KMH-2 48 hours , and for L428 35 hours . Doubling time for the previously inves-tigated NCI-H69 is 65 hours . No obvious explanation to the differences in sensitivities between HDLM-2 and the other cell lines could be related to the doubling time with the possible exception of HDLM-2 , which has a longer G0 phase due to the longest doubling time 70 hours [ 23,26,28 ] . Method viability Differences in histology and microenvironment are evident in HL tumors e.g. , tumor eosinophilia , ranging from no eosinophils present to O200 10 high-power field [ 12 ] . It is therefore tempting to speculate that differences in tumor cell sensitivity to ECP could reflect the number of eosinophils in the original tumors . Possibly the microenvironment high number of eosinophils during tumor progression selects tumor cells resistant to a certain microenvironment for further survival . The specific micro-environment for the cell lines HDLM-2 , KMH2 , and L428 is to our knowledge not known in the reviewed literature . Growth inhibition , but not cell death , of several mamma-lian cell lines has been determined after ECP incubation [ 38 ] . With eukaryotic cells , recombinant ECP binds to the cell surface within minutes , and then within seconds induces transient cytosolic calcium increase [ 39 ] . The metabolic and cytotoxic effects of ECP take a longer time , however . The cytotoxic effect is both time and concentration-dependent however , no further effects were seen between 24 and 48 hours [ 39 ] . As we were interested in cell death , a longer period of 72 hours was chosen . Evidence suggests [ 40 ] that identical signals can be involved in the two different forms of cell death , i.e. , apoptosis and necrosis . ECP-treated HDLM-2 cells ex-pressed more necrosis than apoptosis markers , but it can not be ruled out that the process started as apoptosis . The generally low viability seen in the flow cytometry experi-ments is probably explained by the experimental design , with serum deprivation for 72 hours before retrieval of cells for staining and analysis . However , all comparisons of data were made with cells cultured and treated identically , but 6ECP . A strength of this study is that native ECP , purified from blood donors with known ECP 434 GOC genotype , was used . In previous studies on other eukaryotic cell lines , recombinant ECP was used . However , a limitation is the small amount of ECP available when purifying from blood donors , not allowing for multiple experiments , partic-ularly not at high concentrations . However , the repeated dose response experiments when testing identical ECP fractions within each cell line showed similar cytotoxicity . A cell line is not necessarily a good example of primary tumor material . Cells in an in vitro situation are removed from their normal tissue environment , which may influence the cell response to ECP compared to in vivo situations . The study of primary material in HL is hampered by the fact that HRS cells represent only a minority of the cells in the affected lymph node [ 41 ] , meaning that studies need to begin with cell lines . The consequence of ECP in vivo is still unknown , but ECP is evidently present within tumor tissue . HL patients carrying the ECP434GG genotype , coding for the cytotoxic protein ECP7arg , have more tumor eosinophilia than those with the ECP434GC and ECP434CC genotypes coding for the noncytotoxic ECP97thr Glimelius et al. , accepted [ 42 ] . The cytotoxic activity could cause more eosinophil recruitment , as eosinophils are prime candidates for ampli-fication of local immune responses via a feed forward loop . Eosinophils can be activated by danger signals released from damaged cells and , in doing so , possibly sustain them-selves in the tissue [ 43,44 ] . The more cytotoxic the ECP is to cells in the tumor tissue , the more factors attracting eosinophils may be secreted . This study may explain why many eosinophils are present around some tumor cells without eradicating them totally . If the in vitro cell lines are representative of HL in vivo , eosinophils may have different roles in different HL tumors . Possibly ECP helps in selecting HRS cells that are more resistant and would survive further in the tumor tissue however , this warrants further investigation . The mechanisms by which tumor cells escape immunity are biologically important to understand in the search for new treatment modalities .

21700880	OBJECTIVE—To understand the relationships between mater-nal glycemia during pregnancy and prenatal and early postnatal growth by evaluating cord C-peptide and IGF-I as mediating biomarkers in boys and girls separately . RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS—We evaluated 342 neonates within the EDEN mother-child cohort study born to mothers without diabetes diagnosis before pregnancy . We measured maternal glycemia at 24–28 weeks of gestation and neonates’ cord blood C-peptide used as a proxy for fetal insulin and IGF-I at birth . Reported maternal prepregnancy BMI and all measured infant weights and lengths in the 1st year were recorded . Growth modeling was used to obtain an individual growth curve for each infant in the 1st year . Path models , a type of structural equation modeling , were used for statistical analysis . Path analysis is a multivariate method associated with a graphical display that allows evaluation of mediating factors and distin-guishes direct , indirect , and total effects . RESULTS—Cord C-peptide at birth was positively correlated with maternal prepregnancy BMI and maternal glycemia and was higher in girls . In a path model that represented prenatal growth , there was no significant direct effect of maternal glycemia on birth weight , but the effect of maternal glycemia on birth weight was mediated by fetal insulin and IGF-I in both girls and boys . However , in girls only , higher concentrations of cord C-peptide but not cord IGF-I or maternal glucose were associated with slower weight growth in the first 3 months of life . CONCLUSIONS—Our study underlines the role of the fetal insulin–IGF-I axis in the relationship between maternal glycemia during pregnancy and birth weight . We also show for the first time that high insulin concentration in female fetuses is associ-ated with slower early postnatal growth . This slow , early growth pattern may be programmed by fetal hyperinsulinemia , and girls may be more susceptible than boys to its consequences . Diabetes 60 2152–2159 , 2011 AU-shaped1 relationship has been shown between birth weight and risk of developing type 2 di-abetes . Catch-up growth and rapid postna-tal growth have been associated with obesity and insulin resistance later in life 2,3 . However , other mechanisms may also be involved . In Pima Indians , off-spring of diabetic mothers had slower ponderal and statural growth in the first 1.5 years of life but were heavier by the age of 7.5 years 4 . In offspring of nondiabetic mothers , Eriksson et al. 5–7 have repeatedly shown a specific pattern of growth in individuals who develop type 2 diabetes that involves a lower weight gain in early infancy . The association between short stature in adult-hood and type 2 diabetes is also well documented 8 . Previous studies have generally focused on maternal hy-perglycemia during pregnancy and later diseases in the offspring . However , the specific role of fetal hyperinsu-linism itself has seldom been assessed in these relation-ships . In fetal life , insulin and the insulin-like growth factors are the two major growth–promoting factors 9 . Maternal hyperglycemia stimulates the production of fetal insulin , and fetal hyperinsulinism results in macrosomia the Pedersen hypothesis 10 but may also have programming effects that affect postnatal growth and later metabolism 11–14 . The international Hyperglycemia and Adverse Pregnancy Outcome HAPO study of 25,000 women and children recently demonstrated statistically significant linear relationships between maternal glucose and both cord serum C-peptide levels and neonatal adiposity . HAPO’s findings 15 support the Pedersen hypothesis 10 . In addition to its role in glucose homeostasis , insulin enhances tissue accretion via its anabolic effects on fetal metabolism and by stimulating the production of IGF-I 16 . Some years ago , Gluckman 17 proposed that the primary endocrine axis regulating fetal growth was the glucose–insulin–IGF-I axis . On the basis of the initial model depicted in this article , the aim of our study was to quantify and test the significance of these pathways in the EDEN cohort , using path analyses 18,19 . In addition to the fetal period , we hypothesized that fetal insulin and IGF-I may also affect postnatal growth . There are some indications in the literature of sex-specific differences in the relationship between fetal in-sulin and growth . The gender insulin hypothesis , based on the observation that girls have higher concentrations of insulin at birth albeit a lower birth weight than boys , suggests that girls might be more insulin resistant than boys at least to insulin’s growth-promoting effect 20,21 . Our objectives were to analyze the role of cord insulin , measured by C-peptide , and IGF-I in the associations be-tween maternal plasma glucose during pregnancy and 1 anthropometric measures at birth and 2 growth in the 1st year of life . Potential sex-specific associations were investigated . RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Analyses of growth between birth and 1 year . Finally , to better un - RESULTS At birth , boys were significantly heavier and taller , whereas girls had a tendency to have a greater amount of adiposity , although this was not significant P 0.12 .

The association between C-peptide and birth weight disappeared after adjustment for IGF-I , whereas the re-lation with IGF-I persisted after adjustment for C-peptide , suggesting that IGF-I may be on the causal pathway be-tween C-peptide and birth weight and not the contrary . This was confirmed by the path analyses . Path model for fetal growth .

In girls only Fig. 2 , C-peptide was directly and nega-tively associated with weight at 1 year 20.23 , P , 0.01 . The direct effect of C-peptide on height at 1 year was negative and was partially counterbalanced by a positive indirect effect Table 3 .

DISCUSSION Our data show that the effect of maternal plasma glucose on birth weight and length is mediated by fetal insulin and SD 0.05 , 0.001 IGF-I . The role of the glucose–insulin–IGF-I axis has been suggested previously 17 . However , to our knowledge this is the first time that this mechanism has been described and quantified using path analysis . Fetal insulin is a growth-promoting hormone that acts as a signal of nutrient avail-ability and is a major regulatory factor of IGF-I concentration 16 . Our results confirm the Pedersen hypothesis 10 . In the prenatal period , higher maternal plasma glucose and the associated higher insulin concentrations were associated with accelerated growth in both boys and girls 10 . Our other novel finding pertains to the association be-tween fetal insulin and growth in the 1st year of life . Contrary TABLE 3 to what happens during fetal life , in the postnatal period , higher insulin concentrations were associated with slower ponderal and statural growth in girls only . This opposite association of high-cord insulin concentration with prenatal and early postnatal growth in girls suggests a phenomenon related to the abrupt change from the intra-to the extra-uterine environment rather than to an intrinsic fetal defect . The slower rate of postnatal growth that we observed in girls may reflect a relative long-lasting peripheral insulin re-sistance that could have been induced by a peripheral effect of hyperinsulinism during fetal life . However , a central effect of fetal hyperinsulinism is also plausible . Indeed , the fetal Maternal glycemia and early postnatal period is critical for the development of the brain . A number of animal studies have shown that modifying this environment results in noticeable changes in the brain 27 . For example , modifications of the concen-tration of leptin as a result of experimental nutritional modifications seem to affect the maturation of the appetite regulatory system in the hypothalamus 28 . Fetal hyperin-sulinism may affect the structure or the function of the hy-pothalamus 29,30 and , thus , intervene in the programming of satiety 31 . The clinical relevance of our results is im-portant . They suggest that high insulin concentrations during fetal life may affect not only prenatal growth but also post-natal growth , with a weight difference close to 500 g at 1 year between the infants who belonged to the extreme tertiles of cord C-peptide at birth . The negative association between cord insulin and postnatal growth was seen only in girls . This is consistent with the gender insulin hypothesis that states girls may be more resistant than boys to insulin’s growth-promoting effect 20,21 . In addition to insulin’s effects on growth , insulin resistance may also involve metabolic pathways . One study has shown that girls were more insulin-resistant than boys at age 5 , even after accounting for the difference in fat mass 32 . In addition , the incidence of type 2 di-abetes in adolescence is higher in girls than in boys 21 . However , with puberty , the sex difference seems to re-verse 33 . The lack of association between insulin and postnatal growth in boys may be explained by a dose effect of hy-perinsulinism . We and others have shown that girls have higher insulin concentrations in the cord blood . It is pos-sible that girls are exposed to higher concentrations of insulin in fetal life than boys and that only those high in-sulin concentrations result in slower growth in the early postnatal period . These sex-specific associations might also be explained by a biological interaction of insulin with sex-steroid hormones . Boys experience a surge in plasma testosterone concentration in the first months of life 34 . This may mask the association between cord C-peptide and postnatal ponderal growth and may explain their dif-ferent growth pattern at this age compared with girls . In addition , in the 1st year of life , growth hormone starts to control IGF-I production 9 , and growth hormone is itself regulated by a number of factors , including sex-steroid hormones 35 . Other sex-specific mechanisms are in-creasingly revealed , such as sex-specific programming or epigenetics 36,37 . Unfortunately , animal studies of peri-natal plasticity and early development are often carried out in males only , to avoid confounding by sex , yet males and females have different growth patterns as early as during fetal life 38 . More studies taking sex into account are needed . Our path model failed to show a significant direct effect of maternal plasma glucose at the screening test on off-spring’s birth weight . We believe that this nonsignificant total effect can be explained by a lack of power and the low prevalence of glucose intolerance in our population . Indeed , this association has been clearly shown in pre-vious studies , in particular in the high-risk Pima population 39 and by the HAPO study in 25,000 women 15 . In addition , in the full sample of the EDEN women with 1-h glycemia available n 1,804 , the correlation between 1-h maternal glycemia and birth weight was 0.07 , and this as-sociation was significant P 0.008 . This correlation in the entire cohort is similar to the total effect of maternal 1-h glycemia on birth weight in the path analysis for our subsample Table 2 total effect 0.08 , P 0.13 . There was no significant total or direct effect of maternal plasma glucose on weight or length at 1 year for both girls and boys . This is consistent with the transitory disappear-ance of the association between maternal glycemia and offspring’s anthropometric measurements in the first months of life that we and others have previously shown 40–43 . Strengths of our study include the prospective mea-surement of maternal plasma glucose during pregnancy , cord blood C-peptide and IGF-I at birth , and infant growth during the 1st year of life . We also used an original approach path analysis that allowed us to better un-derstand and to quantify the mediating relationships in-volving insulin and IGF-I . Path analyses remain , however , a schematic approach of complex biological phenomena that should be verified in other studies . Although our models had good fit , there may be equivalent models that fit the data equally well 24 . A limitation of our work is that maternal plasma glucose was measured in the study only once during pregnancy— on average , 3 months before the cord blood sample was taken . Whether this is a good proxy of the mean fetal glucose concentration during gestation is a legitimate question , especially because our sample included women diagnosed for GDM who had been treated . Even though GDM management aims at lowering fetal insulin , cord C-peptide and IGF-I of infants of GDM mothers were still among the highest values of the distribution . It is important to note that a sensitivity analysis showed that GDM ex-clusion did not significantly alter the results . Another po-tential limitation is that the two EDEN centers used different thresholds for the 50-g glucose challenge test , which could have led to an increased number of GDM cases detected in Nancy compared with Poitiers . However , our results did not differ according to center , suggesting that the difference in diabetes screening procedure did not significantly affect the relationship between maternal gly-cemia , the IGF-I–insulin axis , and fetal growth as assessed over the whole range of maternal screening blood glucose concentrations . Conclusion . Our study shows for the first time that high insulin concentration in female fetuses is associated with slower early postnatal growth . Growth in the early postnatal period is critical for the risk of later diabetes 4–7,44,45 . Given our findings that maternal glucose mediates its effect on both sexes’ birth weight via insulin and IGF-I , we pro-pose that this slow , early growth pattern in girls may be programmed by fetal hyperinsulinemia and that girls are more susceptible than boys to its consequences . The as-sociation of slow , early growth with later diabetes sug-gests that both the mitogenic and the metabolic effects of insulin are involved . Additional studies evaluating males and females separately are warranted to better understand potential interactions between fetal insulin and chromo-somal sex or sex-steroid hormones on early postnatal growth .

21708261	a r t i c l e Article history Keywords DOPAC Mitochondria Introduction Parkinson s disease PD , the second most common neurodegener-ative disease after Alzheimer s disease , is characterized by the preferential loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta . The precise mechanisms underlying the cell death in PD are not yet clearly established but several studies have independently implicated an excessive inappropriate formation of nitric oxide •NO and its derivatives Duda et al. , 2000 Giasson et al. , 2000 Good et al. , 1998 Hantraye et al. , 1996 Klivenyi et al. , 2000 Przedborski et al. , 1996 Watanabe et al. , 2008 Yokoyama et al. , 2008 and an abnormal metabolism of dopamine , involving the potential formation of reactive derivatives , such as free radicals , quinones and 6-hydroxydopamine , Alexander et al. , 1997 Filloux and Townsend , 1993 Hastings et al. , 1996 Michel and Hefti , 1990 in cell dysfunction associated to this neurodegenerative disease . However , several other studies point to links between those two pathways Antunes et al. , 2005 namely a Interactions of •NO with dopamine with relevance for neurotox-icity , in particular the following i •NO activates tyrosine hydroxylase the limiting-enzyme in the synthesis of dopamine Roskoski and Roskoski , 1987 ii •NO regulates dopamine release in the hippocampus of rats Segieth et al. , 2000 Wegener et al. , 2000 , affecting also dopamine reuptake Cook et al. , 1996 iii dopamine oxidation by •NO or peroxynitrite ONOO-Daveu et al. , 1997 Laranjinha and Cadenas , 2002 LaVoie and Hastings , 1999 Rettori et al. , 2002 iv formation of reactive intermediates from the interaction of •NO with 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid DOPAC , a major metabolite of dopamine Laranjinha and Cadenas , 2002 . b glutamate potentiates both , •NO production and toxic effects of dopamine toward neuronal cells Garthwaite and Boulton , 1995 . c dopamine enhances mtNOS activity Czerniczyniec et al. , 2007 . d dopamine potentiates mitochondrial damage induced by •NO in PC12 cells Antunes et al. , 2002 . In spite of the potential interaction of •NO and dopamine in vivo , its concerted activity related to mitochondrial damage and its potential involvement in the neurodegenerative diseases have not been examined . So , in a previous work we have bridge •NO and dopamine metabolism demonstrating that DOPAC inhibits mitochondrial respi-ration synergistically with •NO in isolated brain mitochondria , leading to mitochondrial dysfunction Nunes et al. , 2005 . Later , and con-sidering that mitochondrial dysfunction could contribute to the mechanisms of cell death observed during PD , we examined the toxic effects of •NO and DOPAC , independently and in combination , in rat pheochromocytoma-derived PC-12 cells , a cell line widely used as a model for dopaminergic neurons Greene and Tischler , 1976 . We showed that DOPAC above 200 nmol DOPAC 106 cells when com-bined with •NO induced an enhanced cell death , involving mitochon-drial dysfunction that is mechanistically distinct from that induced by •NO Nunes et al. , 2008 . Further considering that major biochemical hallmarks of the PD include inhibition of mitochondrial complex I activity Bindoff et al. , 1989 Mann et al. , 1992 Schapira et al. , 1989 , 1990 as well as a strong depletion of reduced glutathione GSH Riederer et al. , 1989 , 1992 in the substantia nigra of PD patients , in this study , we explored the eventual involvement of the GSH depletion and ROS production in the mechanisms of cell death induced by DOPAC and •NO in PC-12 cells . In particular , we have been interested in the understanding of the sequence of events associated with cell dysfunction , in terms of a free radical production b modulation by glutathione GSH c energetic status and d outer membrane mitochondria permeabil-ity . The significance of these results is discussed in connection with the mechanisms of cell death underlying PD . Results Detection of free radicals by electron paramagnetic resonance Electron paramagnetic resonance EPR is the only technique that candirectlydetectoxygenfreeradicals.However , consideringthatsome of the radicals notably superoxide and hydroxyl radicals are not measurable directly at room temperature we have make use of the spin trap , DMPO , to detect the formation of free radicals in the cell system exposed during 8 h to DOPAC , S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine SNAP or DOPAC plus SNAP . Fig. 1 , shows a spectrum characteristic of the DMPO-OHadduct hydroxylradicaladduct consistingoffourlineswith relative intensity of 1 2 2 1 and splitting constants of 14 G . Such a spectrum was observed in the presence of DOPAC , SNAP and the mixture DOPAC plus SNAP but its intensity varies among the conditions , following the order DOPAC plus SNAPNDOPACNSNAP . Although due to the sink effect of the spin trap quantitative conclusions have to be cautiously taken , the measurements of the peak intensities suggest a synergistic effect in the production of free radicals by the mixture of DOPAC plus SNAP as compared with the individual effects . GSH and GSSG intracellular contents To determine if the free radical production induced by DOPAC , SNAP or DOPAC plus SNAP was associated with alterations of cellular glutathione content , the intracellular GSH and GSSG levels were measured by a fluorimetric assay as described in Experimental methods . As shown in Fig. 2A , in the cells incubated with DOPAC plus SNAP , a significant decrease in intracellular GSH content was early 1 h detected control 48.17±3.89 nmol GSH mg of protein DOPAC plus SNAP 35.75±2.75 nmol GSH mg of protein . The GSH depletion progressively increased over the incubation s time and after 8 h the levels of GSH were reduced to about half of the normal levels Fig. 2A . Concomitantly with the decrease of GSH , the GSSG levels show a tendency to increase in the cells treated with DOPAC plus SNAP as compared to control Fig. 2B . Control DOPAC SNAP Surprisingly , after 8 h of incubation with SNAP , GSH concentration was increased 2-fold over control control 45.8±2.9 nmol GSH mg of protein SNAP 98.8±3.7 nmol GSH mg of protein Fig. 2A . As shown in Fig. 2B , concentrations of GSSG were also significantly increased over the time in the cells incubated with SNAP . DOPAC alone , at the concentrations used , had no significant effect in the intracellular GSH and GSSG levels Fig. 2A and B . The GSH GSSG ratio , a parameter used to indicate cellular redox status Schafer and Buettner , 2001 was also calculated . Fig. 2C shows that only in the cells incubated with DOPAC plus SNAP , occurred a significant increase in the GSSG GSH ratio , suggesting an oxidized cellular redox environment as compared with that in the presence of the individual compounds . It is also apparent that the increase in the GSSG GSH ratio was mainly due to a GSH depletion . Although a GSSG increase was observed Fig. 2B in the cells incubated with SNAP , the GSSG GSH was identical to the control cells Fig. 2C , because a GSH increase was also observed Fig. 2A . The increase in GSH and GSSG observed in the presence of the •NO donor was not further explored , as it is aside of the goal of this work , but due to its relevance this observation is addressed in Discussion . Measurement of mitochondrial complex I activity A decrease in the activity of mitochondrial complex I activity in the substantia nigra of PD patients is well established in the literature Gu et al. , 1998 Janetzky et al. , 1994 Mizuno et al. , 1998 Schapira et al. , 1989 , 1990 . Additionally , several studies showed that GSH depletion can lead to a selective inhibition of mitochondrial complex I activity . So , we next examined the mitochondrial complex I activity in the cells incubated with DOPAC , SNAP and DOPAC plus SNAP for 8 h . A significant reduction of the mitochondrial complex I activity was only observed in the cells challenged with the combination of DOPAC plus A CONTENT 100 GSH protein B 8 GSSG protein C 0.35 0.30 0.25 GSH 0.20 GSSG 0.15 0.10 0.05 SNAP Fig. 3 . Whereas the individual effects of DOPAC and SNAP are insignificant , when in conjunction the compounds exert a synergistic inhibition of complex I . I Effect of glutathione-ethyl-ester GSH-EE and N-acetylcysteine NAC on DOPAC plus SNAP-induced cell death The results presented above suggest that the toxic effects induced by DOPAC plus SNAP in PC-12 cells are related with the generation of an oxidative insult , which likely results from an increased free radical production and a decrease in intracellular GSH levels . Thus , we examined whether thiol antioxidants , such as glutathione-ethyl-ester GSH-EE and N-acetylcysteine NAC , which are able to enhance cellular glutathione content , exert a protective effect against DOPAC plus SNAP-induced cell death . Firstly , we investigated the effect of GSH-EE and NAC on the intracellular GSH levels . For this propose , cells were incubated with 1 mM GSH-EE or with 1 mM NAC for 3 h . Then cells were washed and incubated with SNAP 1 mM or with DOPAC plus SNAP 800 nmol 106 cells 1 mM for 8 h . The intracellular GSH content was measured by a fluorimetric assay as described in Experimental methods . Fig. 4 shows that both , GSH-EE and NAC , protein GSH VIABILITY 40 CELL significantly enhance intracellular GSH content in PC12 cells . The compounds significantly prevented GSH depletion in cells treated with DOPAC plus SNAP , being the GSH content in these cells similar to the GSH content observed in the control cells pre-incubated with GSH-EE and NAC Fig. 4 . Also , GSH-EE and NAC significantly increased the GSH enhancement induced by SNAP Fig. 4 . After these preliminary experiments , cells were pre-incubated with 1 mM GSH-EE or 1 mM NAC for 3 h and then exposed to DOPAC , SNAP or DOPAC plus SNAP . After 24 h , the cell viability by the MTT reduction assay and the cell membrane integrity as measured by leakage of intracellular LDH were examined . We also examined the cellular and nuclear morphology of cells by using the May-Grünwald– Giemsa dye and the fluorescent nuclear dye Hoescht 33258 , respectively , after 14 h of incubation . Total 40 LEAKAGE LDH Control The treatment of cells with 1 mM SNAP alone induced a 51.9±1.6 % loss of cell viability , whereas DOPAC plus SNAP induced an 83±4 % loss of cell viability Fig. 5 . It is important to note that DOPAC alone had no effect in the cell viability Fig. 5 . However , pre-treatment with GSH-EE or NAC completely abrogated DOPAC plus SNAP-induced cell viability loss , being the cell viability of 92.2±1.2 and 99.2±3.4 , respectively Fig. 5 . GSH-EE or NAC per se had no significant effect on the cell viability loss induced by SNAP Fig. 5 . Also , the LDH leakage induced by DOPAC plus SNAP , but not the LDH leakage induced by SNAP alone , was significantly prevented by both , GSH-EE and NAC Fig. 6 . Morphological hallmarks of classic apoptosis include specific morphological changes , such as cell shrinkage , blebbing , chromatin condensation , nuclear fragmentation and loss of adhesion Kerr et al. , 1972 . Indeed , in a previous work aimed at investigating the process of cell death induced by SNAP and DOPAC , we observed morpholog-ical markers suggestive of an apoptotic-type mechanism , including cell shrinkage and nuclear condensation Nunes et al. , 2008 . Here , we examined whether GSH-EE or NAC pre-treatment prevents such nuclear and morphological alterations induced by SNAP alone or in combination with DOPAC . As shown in Fig. 7 , cells previously treated with GSH-EE or NAC and then exposed to DOPAC plus SNAP showed a round or spherical morphology with regular and round-shaped nuclei identical to control cells , not presenting morphological and nuclear modifications . Morphometric analysis showed that up to 90 % of cells exhibited an apoptotic morphology when incubated with DOPAC SNAP and that this was reversed to control values by GSH-EE 120 100 Control LEVELS 40 ATP 20 and NAC . So , GSH-EE and NAC completely protected PC-12 cells against DOPAC plus SNAP-induced cell death . However , GSH-EE and NAC had no effect on the morphological and nuclear alterations induced by SNAP alone data not shown . Taken together these results support that the pre-incubation with GSH-EE or NAC significantly protected PC-12 cells against DOPAC plus SNAP-induced cell death . Effect of glutathione-ethyl-ester GSH-EE and N-acetylcysteine NAC on DOPAC plus SNAP-induced cellular ATP depletion The cellular ATP concentration , a parameter widely used to indicate the mitochondrial function , was also calculated as described in Experimental methods . Cells were pre-incubated with 1 mM GSH-EE or 1 mM NAC for 3 h and then exposed to DOPAC , SNAP or DOPAC plus SNAP . ATP levels in the control condition after GSH-EE and NAC pretreatment are not statically different from the ATP levels in the control condition without GSH-EE and NAC pretreatment data not shown . Cellular ATP concentration was significantly decreased after 8 h of cell incubation with SNAP alone or with a combination of SNAP with DOPAC Fig. 8 but the decrease is clearly stronger in the later case Fig. 8 . The pre-incubation with GSH-EE or NAC significantly prevented the ATP depletion induced by DOPAC plus SNAP but not the ATP depletion induced by SNAP alone Fig. 8 . In summary , GSH-EE and NAC protected the cells from ATP depletion induced by the mixture of DOPAC plus SNAP . Bcl-2 and Bax intracellular levels Several studies suggest that changes in GSH intracellular content affect cell death by regulating protein expression of Bcl-2 family members , especially Bcl-2 and Bax Perovic et al. , 1996 Ranawat and Bansal , 2009 Watson et al. , 1996 Wu and Cederbaum , 2004 . Also , the Bcl-2 family is involved in apoptosis by regulating mitochondrial membrane permeability and , consequently , the cytochrome c release from mitochondria into the cytosol . Given the results above , indicating that GSH depletion has an important role in DOPAC plus SNAP-induced cell death , and also because we have previously observed that the cytosolic content of cytochrome c increased significantly in cells under such incubation condition Nunes et al. , 2008 , we next examined the effects of DOPAC and SNAP , individually and in combination , on Bcl-2 and Bax content . The anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 remained at normal levels up to 6 h of cell incubation in the presence of DOPAC or SNAP data not shown . However , as shown in Fig. 9A , after 8 h of treatment with the mixture of DOPAC plus SNAP , a 2-fold decrease in Bcl-2 intracellular levels was observed , whereas Bax intracellular levels remained unchanged . Thus , there was a rise in Bax Bcl-2 ratio , disrupting the intracellular balance between pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic pro-teins . SNAP alone had no significant effect on Bcl-2 level and an insignificant increasing trend in Bax level was observed after 8 h of treatment Fig. 9B . Consequently , the Bax Bcl-2 ratio in these cells was similar to the control cells . Discussion PD is a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by the slow degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta , leading to a decrease of dopamine concentrations in the striatum . Mechanistically , the details of the neurodegenerative process are still elusive but mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress have been pointed out as general basic mechanisms underlying cell death during neurodegenerative diseases , particularly in Parkinson s disease Henchcliffe and Beal , 2008 . Additionally , GSH depletion in substantia nigra has beenidentifiedasa criticalbiochemicalabnormality , occurring prior to other hallmarks of the PD , including decreased activity of mitochondrial complex I and dopamine loss Gu et al. , 1998 Jenner et al. , 1992 . Along these lines , several studies suggest that the decrease of GSH observed in the brain of Parkinsonian patients may be directly implicated in theselective inhibition of mitochondrial complex I activity and the subsequent mitochondrial dysfunction Martin and Teismann , 2009 . In turn , mitochondrial dysfunction results in an increased generation of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species RONS , entailing a vicious cycle that potentially leads to dopaminergic degeneration associated with PD . Recently , using PC12 cells , we have proposed a novel integrative mechanism , encompassing the interaction of •NO and dopamine metabolism leading to a synergistic mitochondrial dysfunction and cell death that may be operative in PD Nunes et al. , 2005 , 2008 . Given that GSH depletion and mitochondrial dysfunction potentially interconnect at early stages in a pathway leading to death of dopaminergic neurons in the PD , in this study we have followed up our previous hypothesis Nunes et al. , 2008 on the synergistic action of •NO and DOPAC , assessing whether GSH depletion and RONS may be mechanistically involved in cell death of PC12 cells . The production of RONS in the cellular system challenged with DOPAC and SNAP was clearly demonstrated by Electron Paramagnetic Resonance EPR Spectroscopy in the presence of the spin trap DMPO . It was also evident that the combined action of DOPAC and SNAP produced a synergistic increase of an EPR spectrum compatible with the DMPO-OH the hydroxyl radical adduct . It must be noted , however , that the observation of the spectrum characteristic of the DMPO-OH adduct does not necessarily imply the presence of the hydroxyl radical . In fact , the DMPO adduct of the superoxide radical DMPO-OOH is transient and decays in a spectrum identical to that of the DMPO-OH adduct . This is a common observation and , therefore , additional controls are required to distinguish between the two radicals . Nevertheless , the results herein obtained are relevant because support the presence of increased steady-state concentration of free radicals either superoxide or hydroxyl radical in the cellular system upon incubation with DOPAC plus SNAP , as compared with DOPAC or SNAP alone . GSH , a key role molecule in dictating cellular vulnerability of brain to RONS Dringen , 2000 , undergoes selective early depletion in the substantia nigra of PD patients , preceding mitochondrial dysfunction and signs of neurodegeneration Bergeron et al. , 1998 Jenner , 1996 Martin and Teismann , 2009 . We have previously shown that in cells treated with a combination of DOPAC and •NO an early mitochondrial A Bcl-2 B LEVELS 1.25 Bax C Bcl-2 1.5 Bax dysfunction occurs Nunes et al. , 2008 . Here , we demonstrate that , under the combined action of DOPAC and •NO , an early and significant decrease in intracellular GSH content was detected in the cells , but in the absence of a statistically significant GSSG increase . These results are in accordance with observations by other groups studying GSH depletion in the substantia nigra of PD patients , which showed a decrease in GSH content without a concomitant significant increase in GSSG Gerlach et al. , 1994 Perry and Yong , 1986 Riederer et al. , 1992 . Nevertheless , the GSH depletion observed in the cells incubated with DOPAC plus SNAP resulted in an increase of GSSG GSH ratio , suggesting that cellular redox environment becomes more oxidized . The relevance of this observation is that , in many cases , the increase of the ratio GSSG GSH has a direct effect upon signaling pathways with deleterious consequences . It is of note that although the ratio GSH GSSG in the cells challenged with the •NO donor alone is maintained closer to that of control cells , individually both , GSH and GSSG , were found at higher levels . This observation reproduces previous reports showing an increase in GSH levels in cells exposed to •NO Arteel et al. , 1999 Gukasyan et al. , 2003 Luperchio et al. , 1996 . Such GSH elevation was attributed to an induction of cystine uptake and consequently to an increased GSH synthesis . Several others studies also reported a rise of intracellular GSH in cells exposed to an oxidative stress Deneke et al. , 1989 Miura et al. , 1992 Ochi , 1995 . Thus , the GSH increase is likely an adaptative response whereby cells try to cope with the potentially damaging effects of oxidative nitrosative stress . The relevance of GSH steady state in Parkinson s disease is also connected with the notion that GSH loss is associated with a specific inhibition of complex I activity in neuronal cells , including PC-12 cells Barker et al. , 1996 Hsu et al. , 2005 Jha et al. , 2000 . •NO has also been implicated in GSH depletion Hsu et al. , 2005 . It has been emphasized that a decrease in the activity of mito-chondrial complex I is a central theme in the molecular mechanisms underlying Parkinson s disease . Indeed , the post-mortem analysis of mitochondrial respiratory chain activity showed a significant and specific reduction of the activity of mitochondrial complex I in the substantia nigra of Parkinsonic patients Janetzky et al. , 1994 Schapira et al. , 1989 , 1990 , 1992 . Consequently , our results indicate that a dysfunctional cross-talk between •NO and dopamine metabolism , via the interaction between DOPAC and •NO in vivo , resulting in early depletion of GSH connected to complex I impairment , seems to be a critical event that contributes to the neurodegeneration observed in this disease . The decrease in intracellular GSH as an early and relevant event in cellular dysfunction observed in the cells challenged with DOPAC plus •NO is further substantiated by the finding that N-acetylcysteine NAC and glutathione ethyl ester GSH-EE , compounds known to increase intracellular GSH Fig. 4 , exerted a protective effect in terms of the cell death Figs. 5 , 6 and 7 and ATP depletion Fig. 8 . Considering that the intracellular ATP concentration reflects the mitochondrial function , the protection exerted by GSH-EE and NAC is likely related with a strong protectionofmitochondria.Of note , GSH-EEand NACwere ineffectivein the protection of cell death induced by •NO donor alone . This observation was expected since in this experimental condition we did not observe a decrease in the intracellular concentration of GSH . Changes in GSH appear to affect apoptosis by regulating protein expression of members of the Bcl-2 family of proteins . In particular , several studies have shown that GSH depletion lead to a decrease in the intracellular Bcl-2 content , suggesting a relationship between GSH and this anti-apoptotic protein Celli et al. , 1998 Perovic et al. , 1996 Strack et al. , 1996 . However , the mechanism by which GSH depletion alters Bcl-2 protein levels remains unclear . Conceptually , GSH loss could cause a Bcl-2 intracellular decrease by altering the transcription , translation , or the half-life of the protein . Celli and collaborators demonstrated that the GSH depletion results in increased degradation of Bcl-2 protein and an increase in apoptosis Celli et al. , 1998 . Similarly , in our study , the cells facing the concerted action of DOPAC and •NO showed intracellular concentrations of both , GSH and Bcl-2 , significantly reduced when compared with control cells Figs. 2A and 9A . The temporal association between the two processes indi-cates , however , that GSH depletion precedes Fig. 2A any notorious change of Bcl-2 protein Fig. 9A . Preliminary experiments not shown indicate that an increase in mitochondrial GSH counteracts the inhibitory impact of DOPAC NO in the respiratory chain , suggesting that mitochondrial GSH pool may be the trigger for the cellular redox GSH imbalance . Overall , one may conclude that the concerted action of DOPAC and •NO in PC12 cells induces free radicals production followed by an early depletion of GSH which , in turn , translates in a chain of events that culminates in cell death and involves sequentially a reduction of the Bcl-2 content Fig. 9A , leading to a rise in Bax Bcl-2 ratio Fig. 9c and a disruption of the intracellular balance between pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic proteins b permeabilization of outer mitochondrial membrane and c release of apoptogenic factors , in particular of cytochrome c Nunes et al. , 2008 . Moreover , by modulating GHS levels via GSH-EE and NAC toxic events cell death , ATP decrease and Bcl-2 depletion may be inhibited . The sequence of events associated with cell death under experimental conditions relevant for Parkinson s disease , encompassing the interplay of •NO and dopamine metabolism , critically adds to the understanding of the mechanisms of disease .

21722622	a r t i c l e i n f o Article history Keywords Introduction Matrix metalloproteinases MMPs , a major family of zinc-dependent enzymes , are secreted by various inflammatory and non-inflammatory cells in the lung [ 1–3 ] . The MMP family members , categorized on the basis of their substrate specificity , can digest various components of the extracellular matrix ECM . Turnover of ECM , the balance between its degradation and synthe-sis , is the key feature of tissue remodeling that is believed to be the hallmark of several types of lung diseases [ 4,5 ] . MMPs are secreted as an inactive precursor proMMPs and are converted to active MMPs by a variety of stimulants under different pathophysiologi-cal conditions . Pulmonary hypertension PAH is a severe disabling disease characterized by elevation of pulmonary artery pressure and death attributable to right heart failure [ 6 ] . PAH often occurs as a second-ary complication of many pulmonary disorders such as broncho-pulmonary dysplasia , cystic fibrosis , chronic bronchitis and emphysema [ 7,8 ] . PAH is a progressive proliferative vascular disorder resulting from persistent vasoconstriction and remodel - ling of pulmonary vasculature associated with the activation of MMPs [ 9 ] . Of the MMPs , MMP-21 and MMP-9 , in particular , which degrade type IV collagen of basement membranes , are increased in the pulmonary vascular bed during PAH [ 10 ] . MMP activity is tightly regulated at the transcriptional and also at the post translational level where the enzyme activity could be controlled after secretion by tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases TIMPs [ 11 ] . Endogenously present tissue inhibitors of metallo-proteinases TIMPs are important factors in controlling the action of MMPs . Among the four distinct TIMP molecules TIMP-1 , TIMP-2 , TIMP-3 , and TIMP-4 , TIMP-1 appears to be the major inhibitor and forms a noncovalent complex with proMMP-9 and MMP-9 [ 12 ] . IL-1b is known as one of the major cytokines associated with pulmonary hypertension [ 13 ] . IL-1b induced expression of MMP-9 in lung epithelium has been suggested to play a crucial role in pulmonary diseases [ 14 ] . TNF-a , a proinflammatory cyto-kine and TGF-b , a growth factor have been shown to be upregu-lated in some cells upon stimulation with IL-1b [ 15,16 ] . Furthermore , involvement of TGF-b and TNF-a have been demon-strated to induce MMP-9 expression and activation in endothelial cells , fibroblasts and also in keratinocytes [ 17–19 ] . In some sys-tems , proMMPs have also been shown to be activated by a variety of proteases . One upstream mechanism for activation of proMMPs appeared to be due to the involvement of serine proteases such as plasmin , mast cell chymase and pancreatic and tumor cell derived trypsin-2 [ 20–22 ] . Although the proteolytic activation of proMMPs have been documented in some systems and under different conditions , yet the mechanism s associated with their activation especially in pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells SMCs under IL-1b stimu-lation is currently not clearly known . In the present study , we examined the role that TGF-b1 and TNF-a play in activating proM-MP-9 and proMMP-2 during IL-1b stimulation in pulmonary artery SMCs and the involvement of an aprotinin sensitive protease in this scenario . Materials and methods Chemicals Bovine pulmonary artery SMCs were obtained from Cell Applica-tions San Diego , CA . Cell culture supplies , fetal calf serum FCS , aprotinin–agarose , TAME Na-p-tosyl-L-arginine methylester , aprotinin bovine lung , Freund’s complete adjuvant and protein A-agarose were from Sigma Chemical Co .

ELISA kits for TNF-a , TGF-b1 , PDGF-AA , IL-6 , IL-8 , IL-10 , recombinant IL-1b , TNF-a , TGF-b1 , anti-TNF-a and anti-TGF-b1 antibodies were obtained from R D systems Minneapolis , MN . Peroxidase HRP -conjugated goat anti-mouse IgGandgoatanti-rabbitIgGwerepurchasedfromZymedlaboratories San Francisco , CA . Cell culture Bovine pulmonary artery SMCs were grown in Dulbecco’s mod-ified Eagle’s medium DMEM supplemented with 10 % fetal calf serum FCS and 2 % penicillin–streptomycin in T150 tissue culture flasks and kept at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5 % CO2 . The cells were used for experiments between passages 6 and 12 . All experiments were performed in serum free media . Assay of cytokines and growth factors The SMCs were treated with IL-1b 10 ng ml for 18 h , then TGF-b1 , TNF-a , PDGF-AA , IL-6 , IL-8 and IL-10 levels in the culture supernatant were quantified by ELISA kits using the manufac-turer’s suggested protocol . The concentration of IL-1b 10 ng ml was determined to be optimum in separate sets of experiments . Gelatin zymography Gelatinase activities in conditioned media of the cultured SMCs were analyzed by substrate-gel electrophoresis zymography using 0.1 % gelatin as previously described [ 23 ] . Equal volume of samples of conditioned cell culture media were mixed with gel loading buffer under non-reducing conditions , loaded onto the gel and separated by electrophoresis . Thereafter , the gels were washed 2 times for 30 min at room temperature in 2.5 % Triton X-100 and incubated overnight at 37 °C with buffer containing 100 mM Tris HCl and 1 mM CaCl2 pH 7.5 . Gels were stained with Coomasssie Brilliant Blue R-250 0.1 % . Marker lane was separated and destained in 40 % methanol and 10 % acetic acid . Gelatinolytic activity appeared as a clear band on a blue background . Estimation of protein Protein concentrations of the samples were determined by BCA protein assay reagent using bovine serum albumin as the standard [ 24 ] . Western blot analysis Western blot was carried out by following the procedure previ-ously described [ 25 ] . Briefly , proteins were separated in 10 % poly-acrylamide gel followed by transfer to nitrocellulose membrane . Membranes were incubated for 1 h in 5 % non-fat milk in 50 mM Tris–saline containing 0.05 % Tween 20 at pH 7.5 TTBS . Mem-branes were then rinsed four times 15 min each in TTBS and incu-bated in horseradish peroxidase conjugated secondary antibodies . The blots were then washed four times with TTBS and then devel-oped with 0.2 mM 4-chloro-1-naphthol . Assay of aprotinin sensitive protease activity Activity of the aprotinin sensitive protease was assessed by determining the hydrolysis of the synthetic substrate TAME Na-p-tosyl-L-arginine methylester [ 26 ] . Briefly , 300 ll of TAME 37.9 mg in 10 ml distilled water was added to appropriate amount of the enzyme protein , and then the total volume was made up to 3 ml with 0.05 M Tris buffer pH 7.5 . The reaction was monitored at 247 nm for 1–10 min at 37 °C . RNA isolation and semiquantitative RT-PCR analysis Total RNA was isolated with RNeasy Mini Kit Qiagen according to the manufacturer’s protocol . Aliquotes of 2 lg total RNA were used for first strand cDNA synthesis in 20 ll reaction volume with Omniscript reverse transcriptase Qiagen at 37 °C for 1 h . Primer pairs for cDNA amplification in the 50 30 direction were as follows CCCAGACAGTGGATGATGC forward and ACACGGACCACTTGTCCT TC reverse for MMP-2 AGATTCCAGACCTTTGAGGGCGAA for-ward and TTGCCCAGAGACCACAACTCTTCA reverse for MMP-9 GATGTC GTCATCAGGGCC forward and TCGCTCTGCAGTTTGCAG reverse for TIMP-1 CCTGCTGCTGGGGACGCTGC forward and AGTCCTGGTGGCCTGCTTACGGG reverse for TIMP-2 CCCAGAGG GAAGAGCAGT forward CCCTGAAGAGGACCTGTG reverse for TNF-a GGACCTGGGCTGGAAGTG forward and CTGCTCCACCTT GGGCTT reverse for TGF-b1 GTAGCCCTTCTGGTCCTCCT forward and TCTGATCATTCTGGCCTTGC reverse for aprotinin GAG-CGGGAAATCGTCCGTGAC forward and GTGTTGGCGTAGAGGTCCT TGC reverse for b-actin . Upon determining the linear range of PCR for each target gene , PCR amplification was performed on the Perkin Elmer Brinkmann Instruments Inc. , Westbury , New York using FastStart Taq DNA polymerase Roche . Fast StartTaq DNA polymerase was activated at 95 °C for 5 min before the beginning of the cycle . PCR products on 2 % agarose gels were stained with ethi-dium bromide and visualized under UV illumination . Purification of proMMP-9 and proMMP-2 Since treatment of the cells with TGF-b1 increased proMMP-9 and proMMP-2 expression in the culture media which under basal condition appeared insignificant , we treated the cells with TGF-b1 1 ng ml for purification of proMMP-9 and proMMP-2 . The purification steps for proMMP-9 and proMMP-2 were performed by following the procedure of Remacle et al. [ 27 ] . The conditioned medium of TGF-b1 1 ng ml treated pulmonary artery SMCs was precipitated with 70 % ammonium sulfate at 4 °C . The precipitate was centrifuged at 12,000g for 45 min , redissolved and dialysed in buffer A 0.02 % , Brij 35 in PBS , pH 7.4 . The solution was then passed through gelatin-sepharose affinity column , previously equilibrated in buffer A at 4 °C , in order to separate the gelatin binding proteins . Bound material was eluted with sample buffer for electrophoresis 5 % SDS , 4 % sucrose , 0.025 % bromophenol blue in 25 mM Tris buffer , pH 6.0 and loaded in a Prep Cell model 491 Bio-Rad , USA for the continuous elution electrophoresis . A 10 cm separation gel of 7.5 % polyacrylamide and a 2.5 cm stacking gel of 4 % polyacrylamide were cast in the 28 mm diameter tube for electrophoresis . Electrophoresis was performed at 40 mA max 300 V under cooling condition with an anode buffer 25 mM Tris , 192 mM glycine pH 8.3 at 60 ml min for about 16 h . During the run , all proteins were electrophoresed vertically through a cylin-drical sieving gel . The proteins were eluted through the elution tube with a cathode buffer 25 mM Tris , 192 mM glycine , 0.02 % Brij 35 , pH 8.3 onto a fraction collector . Fractions of 2.5 ml were collected and analyzed by gelatin zymography . The fractions containing proMMP-9 and proMMP-2 were pooled , concentrated by Amicon ultrafiltration YM 10 Millipore , and then Western blot studies were performed using their specific antibodies . Purification of aprotinin sensitive protease After stimulation of the cells with IL-1b 10 ng ml for 18 h , the culture medium was collected . It was then centrifuged at 5000g for 10 min at 4 °C . For purification of the aprotinin sensitive protease , all steps were performed at 4 °C unless otherwise mentioned . Solid ammonium sulfate was added in small increments to the fraction and was precipitated with 30–70 % saturation . The suspension was then centrifuged at 12,000g for 60 min at 4 °C . The precipitate obtained was resuspended in 10 mM Tris–HCl buffer pH 7.5 , dialyzed against the same buffer and concentrated using Amicon YM 10 ultra filtration cell . The filtrate was loaded onto 5.0 ml apro-tinin–agarose affinity column , which was previously equilibrated with 10 mM Tris–HCl pH 7.5 containing 5 mM CaCl2 . After re-peated washings 20 bed volumes , elution was performed with the same buffer containing 1.5 M NaCl without calcium . In each tube , 1 ml fraction was collected , kept in ice , and the protein peak was detected after measuring the absorbance of each fraction at 280 nm . The enzymatic activity of the fractions was determined with TAME as the substrate . The fractions containing the protease activity were pooled and concentrated in an Amicon concentrator 10 kDa mol . wt . cut off and the concentrate was applied to Seph-acryl S 200 column 1.4 70 cm previously equilibrated with 10 mM Tris HCl , 150 mM NaCl , pH 7.5 . Peak fractions from the gel filtration column were pooled and further purified by continu-ous elution electrophoresis with Prep Cell model 491 Bio-Rad , USA . The eluted fractions containing the aprotinin sensitive protease activity were pooled , concentrated and stored under liquid N2 for further studies . 2D gel electrophoresis Isoelectric focusing was performed on a PROTEAN IEF Cell Bio-Rad , CA according to the manufacturer’s instruction . The sec-ond dimension was run on to a 10 % polyacrylamide gel and it was silver stained . Isoelectric point of the sample was determined using PDQuest software in a gel documentation Bio-Rad system . Polyclonal antiserum against the purified serine protease was raised in rabbit by subcutaneous injection with 70 lg of the purified serine protease in Freund’s complete adjuvant . The rabbit was boosted two and four weeks later with the same quantity of purified serine protease , emulsified in Freund’s incomplete adjuvant and bled at 6 weeks . Polyclonal antibodies were purified by protein A-agarose affinity chromatography . The peak fractions were concentrated and kept frozen at 80 °C until further use . Effect of the purified aprotinin sensitive protease on the purified proMMP-9 and proMMP-2 We tested the role of aprotinin , an endogenous serine protease inhibitor , to determine the role of an aprotinin sensitive protease on IL-1b induced activation of proMMP-9 in the cells in culture . The logic behind using aprotinin as the inhibitor and TAME as the substrate of the serine protease stems from the fact that PAH caused by a variety of agonists in isolated lungs have been shown to be pre-vented upon pretreatment with aprotinin and TAME [ 28–30 ] . The cells were preincubated with aprotinin 10 lM for 30 min followed by IL-1b treatment for 18 h . The resulting conditioned media were analyzed by gelatin zymography and also by Western blot . To ascer-tain whether the aprotinin sensitive protease could directly activate proMMP-9 , 10 ll of the purified aprotinin sensitive protease 1 lg was incubated with 20 ll each of the purified proMMP-9 2 lg and proMMP-2 2 lg , separately , in 20 ll of 10 mM Tris buffer contain-ing 1 mM CaCl2 . The reaction mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min , and then gelatin zymography was performed . In case of inhibition experiments , aprotinin 10 lM was preincubated with the purified proMMP-9 and proMMP-2 , separately , for 15 min fol-lowed by the addition of the purified aprotinin sensitive protease , and then gelatin zymography was performed . Statistical analyses All experiments were performed at least four times and values are given as the mean ± SE . Data were analysed by ANOVA test . p values 0.05 were considered significant . Results TNF-a and TGF-b1 up regulation by IL-1b Treatment of the cells with IL-1b caused a marked increase in both TNF-a and TGF-b1 in the culture medium Fig. 1A and B . No discernible increase in the levels of other proinflammatory cytokines IL-6 , IL-8 , IL-10 and the growth factor PDGF-AA have , however , been observed data not shown . The level of TGF-b1 pro-duction 5-fold increase with respect to basal condition was greater in comparison to that of TNF-a production 3-fold in-crease with respect to basal condition by IL-1b in the cells . How-ever , the total amount of TGF-b1 production in comparison to TNF-a generation appeared to be more than 10 fold . TNF-a and TGF-b1 mRNA expression were also shown to be increased by IL-1b treat-ment Fig. 1C . Protein and mRNA expression of proMMP-9 , proMMP-2 , aprotinin , TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 Fig. 2A shows that treatment with IL-1b markedly increased 82 kDa MMP-9 gelatinase activity in the culture supernatant . Also , there was a small but significant increase in the 66 kDa MMP-2 activity in the culture supernatant . Densitometric analysis also re-vealed the increase in active MMP-9 and MMP-2 Fig. 2B . The amounts of MMP-9 and MMP-2 proteins in the culture medium were increased upon treatment with IL-1b Fig. 2C , which is con-sistent with the zymographic study Fig. 2A . Treatment of the cells with TNF-a 0.1 ng ml did not increase proMMP-9 and proMMP-2 protein expression , while treatment with TGF-b1 1 ng ml for 18 h stimulated proMMP-9 and proMMP-2 proteins expression , but not their activation , in the cul-ture medium Fig. 2A and C . Combined treatment of TNF-a and TGF-b1 caused stimulation similar to that produced by IL-1b on proMMP-9 and proMMP-2 expression and activation in the culture supernatant Fig. 2A and C . Immunoblot studies indicates that aprotinin , TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 were steadily expressed under basal condition Fig. 2C . However , aprotinin , TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 protein expression were markedly inhibited upon treatment of the cells with IL-1b and TNF-a , but not with TGF-b1 Fig. 2C . Western blots were also quantified using densitometric anslysis Fig. 2D . IL-1b markedly increased MMP-9 and MMP-2 mRNA expression in the cells Fig. 2E . Interestingly , TGF-b1 , but not TNF-a , up regulates MMP-9 and MMP-2 mRNA expression in the cells Fig. 2E . Addi-tionally , aprotinin , TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 mRNA expression were decreased significantly upon IL-1b and TNF-a , but not TGF-b1 , treatments to the cells Fig. 2E . RT-PCR data were also quantified using densitometry Fig. 2F . Preincubation with anti-TGF-b1 antibody 10 lg ml prevented the IL-1b induced 92 kDa proMMP-9 and 72 kDa proMMP-2 pro-tein and mRNA expression Fig. 3A and B , while preincubation with anti-TNF-a antibody 5 lg ml inhibited the IL-1b induced activation of proMMP-9 and proMMP-2 without causing a discern-ible change in the induction of proMMP-9 and proMMP-2 protein and mRNA expression Fig. 3A and B . Combined pretreatment with anti-TGF-b1 and anti-TNF-a antibodies prevented IL-1b in-duced expression and activation of proMMP-9 and proMMP-2 Fig. 3A and B . Role of MMP inhibitors on IL-1b induced activation of proMMP-9 Immunoblot study and zymogram revealed that preincubation with TIMP-1 10 lg ml for 30 min prevented IL-1b induced con-version of 92 kDa proMMP-9 to the active 82 kDa MMP-9 in the culture supernatant Fig. 4A and B , while preincubation with TIMP-2 10 lg ml prevented IL-1b induced activation of 72 kDa proMMP-2 to the 66 kDa MMP-2 in the culture supernatant . MMP-3 inhibitor did not cause any alteration on IL-1b induced increase in proMMP-9 activation Fig. 4A and B . Additionally , Western blot study did not reveal any discernible increase in MMP-3 protein expression in response to IL-1b in the culture supernatant data not shown . Role of IL-1b in stimulating an aprotinin sensitive protease Treatment of the SMCs with IL-1b stimulated hydrolysis of the synthetic substrate , TAME . Our results show that treatment of the cells with IL-1b 10 ng ml and TNF-a 0.1 ng ml , but not TGF-b1 1 ng ml , stimulated the protease activity in the culture supernatant Fig. 5A . Preincubation with aprotinin 10 lM pre-vented IL-1b and TNF-a induced increase in the serine protease activity . Preincubation of the cells with anti-TNF-a antibody 5 lg ml , but not anti-TGF-b1antibody 10 lg ml , prevented IL-1b 10 ng ml induced increase in the serine protease activity Fig. 5B . Purification of proMMP-9 and proMMP-2 ProMMP-9 and proMMP-2 were purified from the conditioned medium of TGF-b1 treated cells . The major contaminating proteins were eliminated in the first two purification steps 0–70 % ammo-nium sulfate precipitation and gelatin sepharose affinity chroma-tography , then proMMP-9 and proMMP-2 were purified by continuous elution electrophoresis . SDS–PAGE profile and the gel-atinase activities during the purification stages are shown , respec-tively , in Fig. 6A and B. Identities of the purified proMMP-9 and proMMP-2 were ascertained by Western blot analysis Fig. 6C and D . 2D-gel electrophoresis confirmed purity of proMMP-9 and proMMP-2 Fig. 6E and F . The fold purification of the purified proMMP-9 and proMMP-2 were , respectively , 147 and 136 Table 1 compared to that observed in the culture supernatant . Purification of the aprotinin sensitive protease The aprotinin sensitive protease was purified to homogeneity from the conditioned medium of the cultured SMCs . The culture supernatant collected after IL-1b treatment was purified sequen-tially by employing ammonium sulfate precipitation , aprotinin– agarose affinity chromatography , Sephacryl S 200 gel filtration chromatography and finally by continuous elution electrophoresis with Prep Cell . Pooled fractions from Prep Cell eluate elicited a sin-gle band containing the protease activity with an apparent molec-ular mass of 43 kDa . The –fold purification of the aprotinin sensitive protease was determined to be 114 Table 2 . The opti-mum pH and temperature for the aprotinin sensitive protease were determined , respectively , to be 7.5 and 37 °C data not shown . The purification profile is shown in the 10 % SDS–PAGE Fig. 7A . 2D-gel electrophoresis data suggests homogeneity of the purified aproti-nin sensitive protease and its isoelectric point was determined to be 7.7 Fig. 7B . Role of new protein synthesis on the activation of aprotinin sensitive protease Western blot study revealed that treatment of the cells with IL-1b 10 ng ml and TNF-a 0.1 ng ml caused a prominent increase in the protein expression of the serine protease in the culture supernatant Fig. 8A . However , treatment with TGF-b1 1 ng ml alone did not show a discernible increase in the expression of the serine protease . Combined treatment with TNF-a 0.1 ng ml and TGF-b1 1 ng ml also increased the serine protease protein profile similar to that of IL-1b treatment condition . Preincubation with cycloheximide 40 lg ml prevented TNF-a induced expression of the aprotinin sensitive protease Fig. 8B and proMMP-9 activation Fig. 8C . Role of aprotinin sensitive protease on proMMP-9 activation Gelatin zymogram and Western blot studies suggest that IL-1b induced proMMP-9 , but not proMMP-2 , activation was inhibited by aprotinin 10 lM Fig. 4A and B . Table 1 Purification of proMMP-9 and proMMP-2 . Prep Cell electrophoresis a Unit 1 lg gelatin degraded per minute at 37 °C . Table 2 Purification of the aprotinin sensitive protease . To determine whether the aprotinin sensitive protease proteo-lytically cleaves proMMP-9 , we incubated the purified serine pro-tease with the purified proMMP-9 . Zymogram study clearly indicates appearance of an 82 kDa gelatinolytic activity profile Fig. 9A . Preincubation with aprotinin prevented the serine prote-ase induced proteolysis of proMMP-9 as evidenced by zymogram Fig. 9A and immunoblot studies Fig. 9B . However , incubation of proMMP-2 with the purified serine protease did not show a dis-cernible activation of proMMP-2 Fig. 9A and B . Discussion This report provides the first evidence of the role of an aprotinin sensitive protease in the proteolytic activation of 92 kDa proMMP-9 , but not proMMP-2 , during IL-1b stimulation in pulmonary artery SMCs . Both TNF-a and TGF-b1 levels are increased upon IL-1b stim-ulation in the cells , and the total amount of TGF-b1 appears to be more than 10-fold higher than TNF-a . Herein , we also determined their individual roles on the expression and activation of the proMMPs . The regulation of proMMP-9 activation appears to be exerted mainly at two different routes , which acts in conjunction . On the one hand , IL-1b induced TNF-a activates an aprotinin sensitive pro-tease on the other hand , the protein and mRNA expression of Fig. 9 . In vitro activation of the purified proMMP-9 by the purified aprotinin sensitive protease . A Gelatin zymogram and B Western blot with anti-MMP-9 and anti-MMP-2 antibodies . aprotinin and TIMP-1 are down regulated by the elevated TNF-a in the SMCs . We also observed that IL-1b increases TGF-b1 level that , in turn , elevated proMMP-9 expression . IL-1b is present in significant concentrations in blood of pa-tients with pulmonary hypertension [ 13 ] . The expression of MMP-9 has been suggested to be linked to the signaling networks that facilitate many pulmonary diseases by degrading ECM [ 31 ] . Previous reports suggested a role of IL-1b in inducing MMP-9 pro-tein expression in systems such as adult murine lung [ 14 ] and rat aortic SMCs [ 32 ] . For remodeling of ECM in pulmonary vasculature , the SMCs are regarded as one of the important sources of MMPs [ 33 ] . The expression of MMPs has been shown to be regulated by several extracellular stimuli such as IL-1b , TGF-b and TNF-a in var-ious types of cells [ 14,17,34 ] . Literature also shows a role for IL-1b in augmenting TNF-a bioactivity in pulmonary microvascular cells [ 35 ] . IL-1b has been shown to induce expression of TNF-a in lung [ 35,36 ] , which appears to corroborate our present findings . Our present study suggests that in basal condition , the SMCs do not show a discernible MMP-9 activity , while TIMP-1 is constitu-tively expressed . However , in response to IL-1b , a marked increase in 92 kDa proMMP-9 expression with consequent increase in 82 kDa MMP-9 activity was observed . IL-1b enhances TGF-b1 and TNF-a level . TGF-b1 , but not TNF-a , increased the expression of proMMP-9 , which remains inactive apparently by forming com-plex with the unaltered TIMP-1 . On the other hand , TNF-a , but not TGF-b1 , stimulates an aprotinin sensitive protease having an apparent molecular mass of 43 kDa and also down regulates apro-tinin and TIMP-1 mRNA and protein expression . Subsequently , the aprotinin sensitive protease acts on the 92 kDa proMMP-9 leading to the formation of active 82 kDa MMP-9 . TIMP-1 inhibits MMP-9 upon binding to proMMP-9 , which apparently block the access of the aprotinin sensitive protease to the zymogen [ 37 ] . Down regu-lation of aprotinin and TIMP-1 appears to be important for the acti-vation of proMMP-9 . The increase in proMMP-9 expression and activation through the aprotinin sensitive protease by the cytokine in the SMCs could play an important role in the remodelling of ECM of pulmonary vasculature . To control the degradation of extracellular matrix , secretions of TIMPs have been suggested to be as important as pro-MMPs production . The expression of TIMP-1 under IL-1b stimulation may vary according to the cell types [ 38,39 ] . Among the cytokines involved in MMP regulation , there is evidence suggesting that TNF-a may be crucial , particularly with regard to activation of proMMP-9 [ 19 ] . In human skin tissue , aprotinin has been shown to inhibit TNF-a caused stimulation of proMMP-9 , which indicated a role of aprotinin sensitive protease in this scenario [ 19 ] . How-ever , no systematic study is available in regard to the mecha-nism s associated with proMMP-9 expression and activation by cytokines in pulmonary artery SMCs . Herein , we examined the involvement of an aprotinin sensitive protease in activating proM-MP-9 in pulmonary artery SMCs during IL-1b stimulation . electrophoresis . The identity , biochemical and biophysical charac-teristics and structure–activity relationship of the aprotinin sensi-tive protease require further investigation and are currently the priority of our research . In conclusion , we have provided evidence suggesting that TGF-b1 stimulates expression of proMMP-9 , while TNF-a activates proMMP-9 via increase in a 43 kDa aprotinin sensitive protease concommitant with the down regulation of aprotinin and TIMP-1 expression during IL-1b treatment to the pulmonary artery SMCs . The mechanism s by which TNF-a stimulates aprotinin sensitive protease during IL-1b stimulation in the cells is currently unclear and requires further investigation . References 
21722858	Idiopathic nephrotic syndrome INS , a disorder character-ized by massive proteinuria due to loss of glomerular perm-selectivity resulting from podocyte functional alterations , affects 16 children out of 100,000.1 Whereas in the majority of cases the disorder is caused by immunological alterations readily responsive to glucocorticoid treatment , and individuals have an excellent long-term prognosis , 10 % –20 % of individuals are steroid resistant SRNS and typically progress to end-stage kidney disease ESKD .2 In recent years , inherited defects in podocyte structure and function were observed in a fraction of children with the steroid-resistant subtype SRNS . To date , abnormalities in seven genes expressed in the podocyte have been re-ported to cause nonsyndromic SRNS in humans.3–9 LAMB2 MIM 150325 mutations cause Pierson syn-drome MIM 609049 , which is characterized by congen-ital nephrotic syndrome with distinct eye abnormali-ties.10 Mutations in exons 8 and 9 of WT1 MIM 607102 have been observed in individuals with isolated SRNS and in those with SRNS associated with Wilms’ tumor or urogenital malformations i.e. , Denys-Drash syndrome [ DDS ] [ MIM 194080 ] and Frasier syndrome [ MIM 136680 ] .11 Together , these individuals account for approximately 15 % –20 % of SRNS cases , suggesting marked genetic heterogeneity of the disorder . In the present study , we performed genome-wide anal-ysis followed by homozygosity mapping to identify mutations in additional genes in a large cohort of SRNS individuals . The study included 17 autosomal-recessive SRNS families , defined according to standard criteria.12 Mutations in NPHS2 MIM 604766 and WT1 MIM 607102 in all cases and in NPHS1 MIM 602716 , LAMB2 MIM 150325 , and PLCE1 MIM 608414 in cases with congenital nephrotic syndrome were ruled out via direct sequencing . In all , 29 affected and 22 normal individuals from the 17 families were included in the genome-wide analysis , which was performed with GeneChip mapping 250K NspI SNP arrays from Affymetrix according to the manufacturer’s recommendations . Genotype files CHP files were generated with Affymetrix GTYPE software and were transferred to the VIGENOS Visual Genome Studio program Hemosoft , Ankara , which facilitates visualization of a large quantity of genomic data in comprehensible visual screens.13 In affected cases , large homozygous segments overlap-ping within and between families were scored . This B intron 16 Glu Cys analysis , which did not show any shared regions of homo-zygosity among the 17 families , indicated extensive genetic heterogeneity of nephrotic syndrome . Each family was then individually analyzed overlapping homozygous haplotype stretches in affected family members were re-corded , and functional candidate genes positioned in these regions were identified . This approach showed that there was one consanguineous family family A , Figures 1A and 1B that contained two affected siblings and a large exon 16 exon 18 homozygous stretch spanning approximately 14 Mb between markers rs16928082 SNP_A-2293685 and rs10841414 SNP_A-2047221 on chromosome 12 . This region harbored 182 genes . In this particular family , four additional loci on chromosomal regions 8qtel , 11p15 , 17ptel , and 18q11 Figure S1 , available online were also observed however , the chromosomal region 12p was high-lighted because of the presence of a highly relevant candi-date gene—protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type O PTPRO , also known as GLEPP1 glomerular epithelial protein-1 MIM 600579 . The role of PTPRO in regulating glomerular pressure and permselectivity was previously demonstrated by the phenotype of the knockout model and antibody treatment studies.14,15 PTPRO primers Table S1 were designed ac-cording to the NCBI genomic reference sequence along contig NC_000012.11 National Center for Biotechnology Information [ NCBI ] RefSeq accession numbers NM_030667.1 [ for the mRNA ] and NP_109592.1 [ for the protein ] . The entire coding region and the exon-intron boundaries of PTPRO were sequenced directly from frag-ments amplified by PCR with an Applied Biosystems 3130 genetic analyzer according to the manufacturer’s protocol . In the present study , a homozygous c.2627 ? 1G T p.Glu854_Trp876del donor splice-site mutation in PTPRO in family A in which both parents were heterozy-gous was observed Figures 1C–1F and Table 1 . In this family , the index individual Figure 1A , IV-1 pre-sented with SRNS at age 9 . He was treated with prednisone and cyclophosphamide without effect . A partial reduction of proteinuria was noted in response to combined therapy with cyclosporin A , methylprednisolone pulses , enalapril , and losartan Table 1 . The second affected sibling Figure 1A , IV-2 was diagnosed at age 5 . Although cyclo-phosphamide and cyclosporin A failed to induce remis-sion , a partial response to combined pulse methylprednis-olone and cyclosporin A therapy was observed Table 1 . We expanded this study to include other individuals with the identical phenotype in order to identify addi-tional families . Screening for a highly polymorphic intra-genic DNA marker D12S1303 in 120 Turkish and 13 non-Turkish individuals in the PodoNet registry for homo-zygosity yielded 17 candidate families for direct sequencing . DNA-sequencing analysis identified a second Turkish family family B with a distinct homozygous c.2745 ? 1G A p.Asn888Lysfs*3 donor splice-site muta-tion in PTPRO Figures 2A–2E and Table 1 . This family included three affected siblings and one healthy sibling the parents were heterozygous , and the healthy sibling did not carry the mutation Figures 2B and 2C and Table 1 . The first sibling in family B Figure 2A , IV-1 presented with SRNS at age 14 cyclophosphamide , pulse methylpred-nisolone , and cyclosporin A failed to induce remission . Renal function progressively deteriorated and ESKD occurred at age 18 . She received a living-related kidney transplant , andtherewasnodiseaserecurrence.Thissibling also carried a heterozygous p.Arg229Gln c.686G A varia-tion in the podocin . The second and third siblings Figure 2A , IV-2 and IV-3 were diagnosed by family screening while they were clinically asymptomatic after screening for proteinuria because of family history . The second sibling Figure 2A , IV-2 was resistant to oral steroid treatment however , partial remission with intensified immunosuppression and a renin-angiotensin system blockade i.e. , oral and pulse steroid , cyclophosphamide , urinary Uc Turkish Albumin mother kidney Uc mutation absent Up mg End-stage were Initial heterozygous mg 16.2 14.1 6.1 0.1 9.9 7 to Nucleotide 1G 1G 1G 1G 1G Alteration wild-type according ? ? ? ? ?

The third sibling Figure 2A , IV-3 initially achieved complete remission with oral prednisone treatment but then developed a steroid-dependent clinical course . A course of oral cyclophosphamide and a maintenance course of low-dose alternate-day oral steroids yielded remission for 1 year . Subsequently , this indi-vidual experienced another relapse , which was completely resistant to oral steroids but partially responsive to monthly intravenous steroid pulses . At the time this report was written , when the siblings were ages 15 and 12 , their glomerular filtration rate was normal however , they both had proteinuria . The study protocol was approved by the Hacettepe University Ethics Committee TBK08 1-57 . Participants or their guardians provided written informed consent . PTPRO extends over 51 kb and contains 26 exons . This geneencodesthereceptor-typeproteintyrosinephosphatase that contains a single intracellular catalytic domain with a characteristic signature motif . The gene product is an inte-gral membrane protein . Several alternatively spliced tran-script variants that exhibit tissue-specific expression have been described among them , only variants 1 and 2 are ex-pressedintheglomerulus.Variant1 NM_030667.1 encodes the longest isoform . The encoded protein has a large extra-cellular domain containing eight repeats of a fibronectin-type-III-like motif . Variant 2 NM_002848.2 lacks exon 17 , resulting in a missing juxtamembrane region Figure S2 . We analyzed the effects of the identified mutations on RNA splicing in both families . We first predicted the consequences of the mutations via in silico analysis by using automated splice-site analysis software.16,17 For the c.2745 ? 1G A mutation the software predicted an abolished site , whereas for the c.2627 ? 1G T mutation a leaky site was predicted . We then used cDNA analysis to observe these changes . We collected fresh hepa-rinized blood from all the individuals , their parents , and healthy controls . In addition , a kidney biopsy was per-formed in one affected individual from each family Figure 1A , IV-2 , and Figure 2A , IV-2 . RNA was obtained from lymphocytes of affected indi-vidual and controls with the QIAGEN RNeasy Mini Kit and from kidney biopsy specimens as well as nephrectom-ized kidney tissues removed for unrelated causes with TRIzol reagent Invitrogen according to the manufac-turer’s recommendations . cDNA was generated by reverse transcription with the QIAGEN QuantiTect Reverse Tran-scription Kit . After cDNA synthesis , PTPRO transcripts were amplified with gene-specific primers see Table S1 , and then PCR products were sequenced . Expression of variant 2 NM_002848.2 was observed in both lymphocytes and kidney tissues . The results unequiv - ocally showed the skipping of exon 16 in family A Figures 1G–1I and of exon 19 in family B Figures 2F–2H in both lymphocyte and kidney tissue cDNA in all the affected individuals . In family A , the skipped exon resulted in a protein that lacked 23 amino acids p.Glu854_Trp876del Figure 1J . These amino acids are not within a recognizable domain or motif of the protein however , they are highly conserved in PTPRO orthologs in evolutionarily distant organisms such as Danio rerio and Fugu rubripes , suggesting a con-served function of the domain assembly within PTPRO Figure 1J and Figure S3 . In family B , the skipped exon introduced a premature stop codon at the very beginning of exon 20 Figure 2G . This change could lead to a protein lacking the tyrosine protein phosphatase domain and the substrate-binding regions Figure 2I or nonsense-medi-ated decay of mRNA . Thus , we further analyzed allelic expression of wild-type and mutant PTPRO alleles in lymphocyte RNA samples from a heterozygous parent Fig-ure 2A , III-2 , a healthy sibling Figure 2A , IV-4 , and an affected individual Figure 2A , IV-2 . Quantitative real-time PCR analysis showed a dramatic decrease in the mutant allele compared to the wild-type allele , suggesting that mRNA was degraded by nonsense-mediated decay Figure 2J . Because both families carrying PTPRO mutations were of Turkish origin , we excluded the presence of both muta-tions in 180 healthy Turkish controls by using an indepen-dent method—restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis RFLP Figure 3 . Using genomic DNA from family members , we assessed the presence of G T donor splice-site mutations in intron 16 via amplification by PCR followed by BsrI digestion , and we assessed the presence of G A donor splice-site mutations in intron 19 via amplification by PCR followed by HphI restriction diges-tion . We visualized 182 bp fragments for the mutated allele , and 116 and 66 bp fragments for the normal allele for BsrI digestion by using agarose gel electrophoresis . HphI digestion generated fragments of 294 bp for the mutated allele and 214 , 66 , and 14 bp for the normal allele the expected fragments , except for 14 bp , were visualized . In addition , 15 individuals who were from the SRNS cohort from the Mario Negri Institute in Bergamo , Italy , and whose SNRS was unexplained were independently sequenced , and no mutations were identified . Kidney biopsies from each family were treated accord-ing to standard methods . For immunohistochemical anal-ysis , antibody against PTPRO anti-GLEPP1 5C11 , BioGe-nex catalog number MU336-UC at a dilution of 1 50 in antibody diluents buffer ScyTek ABB125 was used . Specific immuno-peroxidase staining was developed with the ScyTek UltraTek HRP Antipo-lyvalent Staining System AMF080 horseradish peroxidase and goat 3,30-diaminobenzidine kit , ScyTek with 3,30-diaminobenzidine DAB as the chromogen . DAB-stained slides were counterstained with hematox-ylin . The kidney biopsy specimen of the second sibling in family A Figure 1A , IV-2 showed two globally and three segmentally sclerosed glomeruli among the 25 glomeruli retrieved located in the juxtamedul-lary cortex Figure 4A . Adhesion between Bowman capsules and capillary tufts was noted in another glomer-ulus . Cellular proliferation and matrix expansion were not observed , whereas mild focal tubulointerstitial fibrosis and atrophy was noted . Immunofluorescence analysis showed weak to moderate perimesangial and rare mesangial IgM but no other immunoglobulin or complement deposition . Immunohistochemical analysis with a monoclonal anti-body against PTPRO showed diffuse and strong staining in the podocytes , and this staining was similar to that observed in control kidney tissue Figure 4C . Electron microscopy showed diffuse foot process effacement and widespread attenuation of the glomerular basement membranes 150 nm , which were thought to be consti-tutional because of the absence of hematuria . The outer and inner contours of the basement membrane were smooth and without signs of irregular thickening , lamella-tion , or splitting . Podocytes appeared swollen and vacuo-lated . Immune-type dense deposits were not present . Endothelial cells showed slight swelling and vacuolization Figure 4E . The disease was diagnosed as focal segmental glomerulosclerosis . A kidney biopsy of the second sibling in family B Figure 2A , IV-2 showed that of the 38 glomeruli , three were globally sclerosed the remaining glomeruli were normal or showed slight mesangial prominence without hypercellularity or segmental scle-rosis . The tubulointerstitial compartment was unremark-able except for narrow zones of interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy around the globally sclerosed glomeruli Figure 4B . Immunofluorescence showed that there was not any immunoglobulin or complement deposition . In contrast to family A , immunohistochemical analysis in family B did not show immunostaining with monoclonal antibody against PTPRO in podocytes Figure 4D . Elec-tron microscopy showed diffuse foot process fusion and extensive microvillus transformation of the podocytes Figure 4F . The pathological diagnosis was minimal change disease . PTPRO is a tyrosine phosphatase expressed at the apical membrane of the podocyte foot processes . Tyrosine phos-phorylation of tight junction proteins plays a major role in controlling paracellular permeability , cell signaling , and actin cytoskeleton remodeling . Tyrosine phosphory-lation of nephrin and ZO-1 , key components of the slit diaphragm , alters their association with other slit pore proteins in the membrane.18,19 Abolished PTPRO expres-sion has been observed in various proteinuric nephropa-thies , such as primary focal segmental glomerulosclerosis and severe IgA nephropathy , as well as in experimental podocyte damage leading to foot process efface-ment.20–22 In puromycin aminonucleoside PAN nephropathy , PTPro downregulation preceded the onset of proteinuria.22 The blockade of PTPro by specific anti-bodies increased albumin permeability in isolated rat and rabbit glomeruli , further supporting the essential role of this protein in maintaining glomerular permselec-tivity.15 In the present study , we observed that both muta-tions caused aberrant RNA splicing in one case it led to a premature stop codon p.Asn888Lysfs*3 and degrada-tion of the mRNA via nonsense-mediated decay and in another case to a protein lacking 23 amino acids p.Glu854_Trp876del . Whereas nonsense-mediated decay of the mRNA resulting from the skipped exon 19 caused complete deficiency of the immunoreactive protein , the expression , and membrane location of the shortened protein resulting from skipped transcription of exon 16 appeared to be preserved . We think that the latter muta-tion might still be functionally relevant because the 23 missing amino acids constitute an evolutionarily highly preserved region of the protein . In the present study , histopathological findings in one member of each family showed relatively mild lesions and focal segmental or global sclerosis of a small frac-tion of glomeruli . Ultrastructural analysis showed that the profound foot process effacement and altered phenotypic appearance of the podocytes resembled the anomalies observed in Ptpro mice.14 Ptpro-deficient podocytes exhibit an amoeboid shape with blunted and widened foot processes rather than the typical octo-poid shape , despite the normal glomerular structure observed with light microscopy.14 Although Ptpro mice have shortened foot processes and a reduced total slit diaphragm length , they do not appear to develop major proteinuria . This apparent discrepancy with the increased albumin permeability induced by blocking PTPro activity in rat and rabbit glomeruli15 and with the nephrotic state observed in children with geneti-cally altered PTPRO might be due to organism-specific differences in functional redundancy by other phospha-tases . Notably , four of the five affected children in the present study were partially responsive to intensified immunosup-pressive treatment . In keeping with this observation , steroid treatment selectively attenuated downregulation of PTPro in the PAN model.22 Regulation of phosphatases is an important mechanism of glucocorticoid action in many biological systems 23 hence , PTPRO mutations may represent another hereditary disorder of podocyte function with partial susceptibility to immunosuppressive therapy , as previously observed in individuals with abnormalities in phospholipase C epsilon-1 , another protein involved in podocyte cell signaling.8 The oldest sibling in family B Figure 2A , IV-1 had a more severe disease course than the other affected siblings and had complete resistance to intensified immu-nosuppressive therapy and progressed to ESKD . Of note , the p.Arg229Gln polymorphism in the gene encoding podocin—the most commonly mutated protein in child-hood-onset SRNS—was observed in this individual but not in the other siblings . p.Arg229Gln , which is the most frequent podocin variant and which occurs in 3 % –13 % of Europeans , is considered a nonneutral polymorphism , because the mutant protein exhibits decreased nephrin binding in vitro.24 Late-onset SRNS has been described in individuals compound heterozygous for the p.Arg229Gln variant together with a pathogenic NPHS2 mutation.25 An interesting possibility is that heterozygosity for podo-cin p.Arg229Gln modified the onset and course of the disease in family B. In conclusion , we identified recessive mutations in PTPRO as another cause of childhood nephrotic syndrome with reduced steroid responsiveness and therefore propose use of the denomination NPHS6 as a synonym . While ex-panding the spectrum of hereditary nephrotic syndromes , PTPRO will also provide a better understanding of the pathogenetic mechanisms underlying proteinuric diseases and the clinical management of nephrotic children .

21723849	a r t i c l e i n f o Article history Keywords Introduction Coffee is one of the most widely consumed beverages world-wide . During the past few years , evidence of the health benefits [ 1 ] and the important contribution of coffee brew to the intake of anti-oxidants in the diet [ 2–4 ] has increased coffee consumption . Many studies have examined the association between coffee consumption and health , particularly cardiovascular morbidity . The question of whether or not coffee intake increases the risk of coronary heart disease remains unanswered . Several studies have shown that caffeine in coffee induces various acute cardiovascular effects , including effects on blood pressure , circulating catechola-mines , arterial stiffness , and endothelium-dependent vasodilation [ 5,6 ] . On the other hand , coffee consumption is also associated with the decreased risk of type 2 diabetes [ 7 ] , Alzheimer’s disease [ 8 ] , and cancer [ 9 ] . It is said that these effects are produced by polyphe-nols , which have anti-oxidant activity . Anti-oxidant activity refers to the ability of polyphenol compounds to prevent damage caused by reactive oxygen species ROS such as by radical scavenging or to prevent the generation of these species by binding iron [ 10 ] . Chlorogenic acid ChA and caffeic acid CaA are the major phenolic compounds in coffee and act as anti-oxidants . However , phenolic compounds , which are generally effective anti-oxidants , can become pro-oxidants in the presence of Cu2+ to induce DNA damage under certain conditions . It has been demonstrated that com-pounds bearing o-dihydroxyl groups i.e. , ChA and CaA are the most active in inducing plasmid pBR322 DNA strand breakage in the presence of Cu2+ [ 11 ] . The major dietary source of nitrite includes cured meat and cere-als , but approximately 90 % of nitrite ingested by humans is accounted for by the reduction of nitrate in the oral cavity via the action of nitrate reductase produced by microorganisms present in the oral cavity [ 12 ] . Sodium nitrite NaNO2 is widely used as a food additive to preserve and tinge color on cured meat and fish [ 13 ] . Ni-trite concentrations in vivo are 0.5–3.6 lM in plasma [ 14 ] , 15 lM in respiratory tract lining fluid [ 15 ] , and 30–210 lM in saliva [ 16 ] , making nitrous acid formation likely in many tissue compartments . Excessive nitrite production is noted particularly in inflammation . Humans , therefore , ingest nitrite from both exogenous and endoge-nous sources . At the acidic pH of the stomach , nitrite yields nitric oxide NO and NO-derived species that may exert a biological impact locally in terms of antimicrobial effects , blood flow , mucus secretion , and gastric motility . It has been reported that the co-administration of catechol and NaNO2 to rats increased 8-hydro-xy-20-deoxyguanosine 8-OHdG levels in forestomach epithelium DNA [ 17 ] . Some dietary phenolics with anti-oxidant activity can reduce nitrite to NO under acidic conditions . As coffee contains ChA and CaA , it is possible that these compounds reduce nitrous acid to NO when NaNO2 is mixed with gastric juice after drinking coffee . In fact , it has been reported that ChA and CaA were nitrated by NaNO2 under acidic conditions , and the nitration could give rise to several nitrated ChA and CaA compounds in vitro [ 18 ] . However , there are no reports of the characteristics of the nitrated compounds . In the present study , we identified compounds produced by the reaction between ChA or CaA in coffee and NaNO2 in artificial gastric juice . The identified phenolic compounds and the nitrated phenolic compounds were assessed for their anti-oxidant , pro-oxi-dant , and nitration activities by performing an in vitro assay . Materials and methods Reagents and chemicals Chlorogenic acid ChA was purchased from Tokyo Chemical Industry Tokyo , Japan . Caffeic acid CaA , nuclease P1 , and DNA Extractor Kit were purchased from Wako Pure Chemical Industries Tokyo , Japan . Copper II sulfate pentahydrate and sodium nitrite NaNO2 were purchased from Kanto Chemical Tokyo , Japan . a-4-Pyridyl-1-oxide -N-tert-butylnitrone POBN was purchased from Labotech Co. Tokyo , Japan . Deoxyribonucleic acid sodium salt from calf thymus , phosphatase alkaline from bovine intestinal mu-cosa , deoxyguanosine dG , and 8-hydroxy-20-deoxyguanosine 8-OHdG were obtained from Sigma Tokyo , Japan . Water was puri-fied using a Milli-Q gradient A10 system Millipore , MA , USA . Other chemicals and solvents were obtained from Wako Pure Chemical Industries . Synthesis of nitrated chlorogenic acid and caffeic acid Nitrated ChA and CaA were synthesized according to the method reported by Napolitano and d’Ischia [ 18 ] . Briefly , ChA or CaA 5 mmol was dissolved in 0.05 M acetate buffer , pH 4 500 mL and NaNO2 25 mmol and the mixture was continuously stirred at room temperature . Then , the mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate 3 150 mL and the combined organic layers were dried over sodium sulfate to dryness . The target substance was removed from the reaction solution by silica gel chromatography using tolu-ene–ethyl acetate 80 20 eluent A , 60 40 eluent B or 40 60 eluent C . Purified nitrated ChA and CaA were identified by comparison of their spectral properties 1H NMR , 13C NMR , and LC-PDA-ESI-MS with those reported [ 18,19 ] .

Analytical conditions for ChA , CaA , and nitrated phenolic compounds High-performance liquid chromatography was performed with a SHIMADZU Shimadzu , Tokyo , Japan systemthatconsistedofanLC-10ADVP pump , an SIL-HTC autosampler , a CTO-10AVP thermostated column compartment , a DGU-14AM vacuum degasser , and a SPD-M10AVP photodiodearraydetector , andwasconnectedtoaSHI-MADZULCMS-2010Amass spectrometer . Separationof the analytes was accomplished on an Xbridge C18 column 3.5 lm , 2.1 150 mm Waters , Japan .Columnoven temperaturewas maintained at 40 °C . Mobile phase was 0.1 % aqueous formic acid and 0.1 % formic acid in acetonitrile 90 10 , v v and the flow rate was constant at 0.2 mL min . The photodiode array detector was set at 300 nm . The analytes were detected in the electrospray negative ionization mode using the scan ion monitoring mode . Curved desolvation line and heat block temperatures for the analysis were set at 250 and 200 °C , respectively . Nebulizer gas flow was set at 1.5 L min and detector voltage was set at 1.3 eV . DPPH radical scavenging activity The modified DPPH method was used for the determination of anti-oxidant activity [ 20 ] . DPPH radical solution 2 mM was pre-pared in methanol and the phenolic compounds were diluted in methanol to concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 2 mM . In a 1.5 mL disposable tube , the prepared DPPH 250 lL solution was added to a sample of diluted phenolic compound 50 lL and methanol 200 lL . The mixed samples were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C . Absorbance was monitored at 540 nm with a BIO-RAD Model 550 microplate reader . Then , the effect of phenolic compounds on DPPH absorbance was estimated . DPPH scavenging activity was deter-mined with the following equation % scavenging activity [ Acontrol Asample ] [ Acontrol Aascorbic acid ] 100 . DPPH plus ascorbic acid 10 mM was used as positive control . Data are means ± SD of three determinations . 1.5 300 nm 1.0 100 ? ?

Instead of directly trapping OH , this method traps and measures CH3 by using POBN that is formed during the interaction of DMSO with OH . Moreover , this method can detect OH , which is not affected by Cu2+ . The analysis of CH3 was carried out with an ESR spectrometer JES–RE1X , JEOL Co. , Tokyo , Japan . The ESR spectrum was measured at a microwave frequency of 9.43 GHz , a magnetic field of 335.5 ± 5 mT , a micro-wave power of 9 mW , a modulation of 100 kHz , a time constant of 0.03 s , and a sweep time of 30 s , using the ESR spectrometer . 100 ? 0.5 Intensity 100 ? 100 ? ?

A typical reaction mixture for incubation consisted of phos-phate buffer 50 mM , pH 7.4 , POBN 10 mM , DMSO 10 % , pheno-lic compound 2 mM , and copper II sulfate pentahydrate 1 mM in a final volume of 0.3 mL . Samples were used in the reaction that was performed at 37 °C for 30 min . DNA digestion and determination of dG and 8-OHdG In order to prevent the formation of oxidative by-products dur-ing DNA isolation , DNA was digested by using the slightly modified analyte 80 M 1600 analyte 1200 of 800 Concentration 400 M 1600 analyte 1200 of 800 Concentration 400 M ? 100 analyte 80 of 60 M 100 analyte 80 of 60 method of Ishii et al. [ 22 ] . Calf thymus DNA 2 mg mL at 250 lL was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min after adding 50 lL of phenolic compound 2 mM and 50 lL of copper II sulfate pentahydrate 1 mM in 0.15 mL of phosphate buffer 50 mM , pH 7.4 . Treated calf thymus DNA was immediately centrifuged at 10,000g for 5 min at 10 °C after the total volume was adjusted to 1.5 mL by adding NaI and 2-propanol . After washing with ethanol , the pellet was dissolved in 0.2 mL of 20 mM sodium acetate buffer , pH 4.8 . DNA was enzymatically hydrolyzed by adding 5.0 lL of nuclease P1 to obtain a concentration of 500 U mL . The mixture was incu-bated at 60 °C for 15 min . After the addition of 20 lL of 1.0 M Tris–HCl buffer pH 8.0 , 5.0 lL of alkaline phosphatase was added to give a final concentration of 20 U mL . The mixture was passed through a 3000 NMWL filter Millipore , Tokyo , Japan after incu-bating at 37 °C for 60 min . Then , the digested solution was injected into the HPLC–UV–ECD instrument for 8-OHdG and dG analysis . activity % 75 activity Fig. 5 .

HPLC–UV–ECD conditions for dG and 8-OHdG analysis In the assay for dG and 8-OHdG , the UV detector and the ECD instrument used were a Shimadzu SPD10A Tokyo , Japan and an ESA Coulochem III Tokyo , Japan , respectively . A Shimadzu 10Avp pump Tokyo , Japan was used to induce flow through the analytical column . An Inertsil ODS3 4.6 mm 150 mm , 3.0 lm , GL Sciences , Tokyo , Japan was used for separation . An aliquot 20 lL of the sample was injected into the ODS column whose temperature was maintained at 40 °C . The mobile phase was a mixture of 10 mM sodium dihydrogen phosphate methanol 97 3 , v v . The compounds were eluted isocratically at a flow rate of 1.0 mL min . The wavelength of the UV detector was set at 290 nm for the detection of dG . The Coulochem III ECD instrument was used with a guard cell Model 5020 350 mV and an analyt-ical cell Model 5011 electrode 1 , 150 mV electrode 2 , 300 mV . Analysis of nitrate by the Griess assay Solutions 1 mM of all compounds were prepared at 37 °C using sodium phosphate buffer pH 7.4 or 0.1 M HCl . After incuba-tion , an aqueous solution of NO2 was mixed with Griess reagent 25 mM sulfanilamide and 2.5 mM N-1-naphthyl ethylenedia-mine in 2.5 % phosphoric acid and the whole was incubated at room temperature for 10 min . Absorbance was monitored at 540 nm with a BIO-RAD Model 550 microplate reader . Acidification of the buffered solution resulted in an absorbance band at 540 nm , which was indicative of the corresponding azo dye [ 23,24 ] . Statistical analysis All results are expressed as means ± SD . Statistics were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance ANOVA and if statistically sig-nificant , post hoc analysis using the Dunnett method was con-ducted for multiple comparisons among groups . Values of P 0.05 and 0.01 were considered statistically significant . Results Characterization of products formed in the reaction of phenolic compounds with NaNO2 In order to identify compounds produced by the reaction be-tween ChA or CaA and NaNO2 in artificial gastric juice , both stan-dards and synthesized compounds were prepared and analyzed Fig. 2 . In the first series of experiments , ChA or CaA 1 mmol was reacted with NaNO2 2 mmol in the acidic condition 0.1 M HCl or the acidulous condition 0.05 M acetate buffer pH 4.0 . To identify the substrates and the products , HPLC was performed after incubation of ChA or CaA in the presence of NaNO2 . HPLC of the reaction mixture after 3 h incubation indicated complete sub-strate consumption and the presence of a complex pattern of prod-ucts Fig. 3A . Peaks B , D , E , and F corresponded to the major components after incubation . Peaks A and C , which are ChA and CaA , respectively , showed a marked decrease in intensity in the presence of NaNO2 . Peaks B , D , E , and F showed an increase in intensity and corresponded to the major components after incuba-tion Fig. 3B . The complexity of the reaction mixture was confirmed by MS and NMR measurements . Peaks B , D , E , and F each gave a deprotonated ion peak [ M H ] in their ESI MS spectra , which appeared at m z 398 , 180 , 178 , and 193 , respectively , suggesting the formation of nitrated derivatives of ChA-NO , CaA-NO-1 , CaA-NO-2 , and CaA-NO-3 . The chemical stability of the analytes was assessed under several conditions and the results are shown in Fig. 4 . All com-pounds were stable under the acidic condition . On the other hand , compounds CaA-NO-2 and CaA-NO-3 , which are nitrated CaA , decomposed under the neutral condition . These data suggest that nitrated phenolic compounds were formed by reacting each phe-nolic compound ChA or CaA with NaNO2 and could exist stably under the gastric acid condition . DPPH radical scavenging activity of phenolic and nitrated phenolic compounds The anti-oxidant activities of the phenolic compounds were measured by the DPPH method , which is one of the oldest and the most frequently used methods for evaluating anti-oxidant activity . The scavenging effects of phenolic compounds on DPPH radicals are shown in Fig. 5 . All the phenolic and nitrated phenolic compounds exhibited anti-oxidant activity . The DPPH radical scav-enging activities of nitrated phenolic compounds , such as ChA-NO , CaA-NO-1 , CaA-NO-2 , and CaA-NO-3 , were stronger than those of the non–nitrated phenolic compounds . Measurement of hydroxyl radical and oxidative damage in calf thymus DNA To investigate ROS generated by the reaction of phenolic com-pounds with Cu2+ we performed electron spin resonance ESR measurements and determined whether these compounds have the ability to generate ROS . The pro-oxidant activities induced by the reaction of phenolic compounds with copper are shown in Fig. 6A . The results indicated that ChA and CaA significantly gener - compounds generated much less ROS in the same conditions . In the next set of experiments , we examined the effects of the †† CaA CaA-NO-1 CaA-NO-2 CaA-NO-3 †† CaA CaA-NO-1 CaA-NO-2 CaA-NO-3 336 338 340 Field mT ated ROS in the presence of Cu2+ . Meanwhile , nitrated phenolic Cu2+ on 8-OHdG formation using the same ESR conditions . When calf thymus DNA was treated with phenolic compounds in the presence of CuSO4 , 8-OHdG was formed . ChA and CaA induced DNA oxidation in the presence of Cu2+ Fig. 6B . Meanwhile , nitrated phenolic compounds obviously showed reduced pro-oxi-dant activity in the presence of Cu2+ . Thus , nitrated phenolic compounds do not have pro-oxidant activity . Measurement of nitric oxide by Griess assay The most famous and frequently used method of analysis of ni-trite and nitrate is the Griess assay . To examine whether or not NO2 is generated from phenolic or nitrated phenolic compounds , we performed the Griess assay . As shown in Fig. 7 , all the com-pounds did not generate NO2 under the acidic condition and only CaA-NO-3 was found to generate a significant amount of NO2 in the neutral condition . These data suggest that CaA-NO-3 decom-posed while generating NO under the neutral condition . 2 Discussion We have identified nitrated phenolic compounds generated by the reaction between ChA or CaA and NaNO2 in artificial gastric juice and assessed their anti-oxidant , pro-oxidant , and nitration activities by an in vitro assay . The mean pH of gastric juice is 1.2 . However , it is significantly increased by an H2 receptor antagonist [ 25 ] . In our first series of experiments , ChA or CaA was reacted with NaNO2 in the acidic condition 0.1 M HCl or the acidulous condition 0.05 M acetate buffer pH 4.0 . The reaction after 3 h indicated complete substrate consumption and the presence of a complex pattern of products Fig. 3A . In particular , several compounds , such as ChA-NO and CaA-NO , were generated at high concentrations under the acidulous condition . The chemical stability of the analytes was assessed under several conditionsandtheresultsareshownin Fig.4 . Allcompoundsexisted stably under the acidic condition . On the other hand , compounds CaA-NO-2 and CaA-NO-3 , which are nitrated CaA compounds , decomposed under the neutral condition . This result indicated that M ? 20 -2 NO M NO these compounds were stable in gastric juice but decomposed after being absorbed by the body i.e. , blood and liver . Fig. 5 shows the results of determination of the anti-oxidant activity of the phenolic compounds by measuring DPPH radical scavenging activity . Our results indicated that nitrated phenolic compounds have stronger anti-oxidant activity than non-nitrated phenolic compounds . Sroka and Cisowski [ 26 ] reported the anti-oxidant activity of phenolic acid . The free radical scavenging activity of phenolic acids is correlated with the number of hydroxyl groups bound to the aromatic ring and or the position of the hydroxyl groups ortho or para in the chemical structure . On the other hand , Kawabata et al. [ 27 ] investigated iron complexes of catechol and nit-rocatechol derivatives . In the Fenton-like reaction , iron-catechol generated more OH than iron–nitrocatechols . Nitrocatechol deriva-tives having a conjugated structure can sequester chelated iron more effectively than catechol . These results indicated that nitrated phenolic compounds can bind to metal ion and prevent the genera-tion of a large amount of OH . In general , phenolic compounds can switch from being anti-oxi-dants to pro-oxidants in the presence of Cu2+ to induce ROS produc-tion and subsequently DNA damage . It is said that ortho-dihydroxyl groups that can chelate with Cu2+ induce the greatest pro-oxidant activity . The initial electron-transfer oxidation of phenolic com-pounds by Cu2+ generates the corresponding semiquinone radical and the radical undergoes a second electron-transfer reaction with O2 to form ortho-quinone and superoxide anion O2 . O2 reacts with Cu+ to give hydrogen peroxide H2O2 , which is readily con-verted via a Fenton-like reaction into OH [ 11 ] . Pro-oxidant experi-ments Fig. 6 have shown that ChA and CaA generate OH when mixed with Cu2+ . On the other hand , nitrated phenolic compounds showed decreased pro-oxidant activity . These results corresponded to the results of anti-oxidant activity measurements . A number of NO donors , namely , molecules that are able to release NO in the physiological condition , such as furoxans and organic nitrates , were proven to display cytotoxic and cytostatic ef-fects on viruses and microbial agents [ 28–30 ] . Furoxan 1,2,5-oxa - diazole-2-oxide is a heterocyclic system known to chemists for its intriguing chemistry and structure . It is known that furoxans are able to release NO at physiological pH , in the presence of thiol cofactors . The mechanism of this release appears to be complex and may involve more than one redox form of NO [ 30 ] . Hybrid NO donor furoxan-based drugs are novel drugs that retain the pharmacological activity of the parent compound yet also has the biological activities of NO . To examine whether NO is generated from phenolic or nitrated phenolic compounds , we performed the Griess assay . CaA-NO-3 was found to significantly increase NO2 concentration in the neutral condition Fig. 7 , because CaA-NO-3 has a furoxan ring . Conclusions We identified the characteristics of compounds generated by reacting ChA or CaA contained in coffee with NaNO2 in artificial gastric juice . All the compounds existed stably under the acidic condition . In addition , ChA , CaA , and the nitrated phenolic com-pounds were assessed for their anti-oxidant , pro-oxidant , and nitration activities by an in vitro assay . The nitrated phenolic com-pounds seemed to show an increase in anti-oxidant activity and a decrease in pro-oxidant activity . However , CaA-NO-3 , which has a furoxan ring , significantly increased NO2 concentration in the neutral condition . Further studies are required to reveal the chem-ical mechanisms underlying the anti-oxidant , pro-oxidant , and nitration activities of phenolic compounds .

21763484	Intellectual disability ID , also called mental retardation MR , is a devastating neurodevelopmental disorder that has a serious impact on the affected individuals and their families , as well as on health and social services . It is believed to occur with a prevalence of ~1 % –3 % within the population , 1,2 and is frequently the result of genetic aberrations . ID can present as the sole clinical feature non-syndromic [ NS ] see MIM 249500 , or it can be present with additional clinical or dysmorphological features syn-dromic [ S ] . Generally speaking , it is much more straight-forward to identify the genetic cause of S-ID patients because the comorbid features frequently enable a medical geneticist to narrow down the suspected cause to a mutation in a short list of genes , or perhaps in a single gene . However , for individuals with NS-ID , no secondary clues assist the molecular diagnosis . ID is significantly more frequent in males than in females , and it had been assumed that ~25 % of severe cases were X-linked how-ever , a recent review suggests that X-linked mutations contribute to no more than 10 % of cases , 3 and thus it is expected that there will be many more autosomal genes whose mutations cause NS-ID , both dominant and reces-sive . However , as a result of the high degree of genetic heterogeneity , mutations in only seven genes have been reported to cause NS-ARID , and all of these have been identified on the basis of mapping regions of autozygosity or homozygosity-by-descent HBD in multiplex consan-guineous families reviewed in Kaufman et al.4 . We ascertained three large NS-ARID-affected multiplex consanguineous families from a farming community in the Dera Ghazi Khan district , within Punjab province in Pakistan MR7 , MR8 , MR9 , one from Sukkur in Sindh province MR43 , and one from Iran 8600060 Figure 1 .

MR8-IV 1 died in 2009 from hepatitis C . MR8-IV 2 age 10 years has a slightly higher level of functioning than MR7-IV 5 and IV 6 and speaks in sentences . He is toilet trained can dress himself if supervised . He attends school , can read words of one or two syllables , and can count to ten . MR9-II 1 age 18 years has a developmental trajectory similar to that of MR7-IV 5 and IV 6 . He is able to speak in sentences but is unable to read or write . Inappropriate sexualized behavior is a major cause for concern to the family . He has epileptic seizures , which started at 10 years of age . He has at least one episode per week . Episodes begin with twitching of the facial muscles , then become general-ized , at which point he loses consciousness . The seizures have a tonic and then clonic phase and last for several minutes , after which he takes 3 to 4 hr to recover . During this period he is drowsy and disorientated . He frequently becomes incontinent during the fit . Sometimes the family members are able to avert a fit by distracting his attention . MR9-II 3 age 9 years has a developmental trajectory similar to that of her sibling , MR9-II 1 , but no epilepsy re-ported to date . Electroencephalographs were not available for MR9-II 1 . Verbal and physical aggression is a common feature among affected individuals from MR7 and MR9 , but not for individual MR8-IV 2 . Mild dysmorphic features were noted for members of families MR7 , MR8 , and MR9 see Table 2 however , these can not be excluded as familial traits , and the families are categorized as nonsyndromic . It was established that MR7 , MR8 , and MR9 all shared a HBD region on chromosome 9 9q34.3 between SNPs rs11103117 and rs12238423 [ nucleotides 137,667,734– 139,811,104 UCSC March 2006 ] Figure 2 , and the locus was assigned as MRT15.5 The critical region was 2.14 Mb , and linkage analysis gave LOD score ? 4.8.5 Although we were unable to establish familial connections in the ancestry of families MR7 , MR8 , and MR9 , comparison of haplotypes suggests a common founder . MR43 has three affected members , VI 1 , VI 4 , and VI 5 ages 16 , 9 , and 8 , respectively with milder , higher func-tioning intellectual disability . On assessment , VI 4 showed delayed developmental milestones he sat at 9 months and walked at 2 years . He can talk in sentences and is independent in terms of self care . He can help with chores around the farm . He is sociable and caring but can become verbally and physically aggressive upon provocation and can damage property . On the basis of the assessment , he has mild ID estimated IQ 55–65 . He has epileptic seizures , which started at 6 years of age . These are primary generalized seizures , which start with eye rolling followed by loss of consciousness . Electroencephalographs were not available . His physical appearance shows facial dys-morphic features , including down-slanting palpebral fis-sures , hypertelorism , a long face , flattened malar regions , a short philtrum , everted lips , a broad nasal root , and a small chin Table 2 . He has fifth-finger clinodactyly . His elder sister IV 1 and younger brother IV 5 have a similar developmental trajectory and level of functioning and similar dysmorphic features IV 1 was not assessed , but no history of epilepsy . Brain computed tomography CT scan for an VI 4 was examined by a radiologist GI and showed no apparent abnormalities , including no obvious white-matter abnormalities or obvious cerebellar atrophy . For MR43 , an HBD region overlapped with that of MRT15 9q34.3-qter SNPs rs11103399– rs11137379 nucleotides 136,609,628–140,147,760 Figure 2 . The Iranian family , 8600060 , had three affected members of ages 11 , 23 , and 25 years . They had mild to moderate NS-ARID , which was ascertained and mapped as previously described6 to 9q34.3 SNPs rs2031825– rs11137163 , 137,166,820–139,653,199 Figure 2 , and linkage analysis gave an LOD score ? 3.1.6 On assessment , the 11-year-old boy V 1 showed only slight develop-mental delay . He started to walk at 1.5 years of age . His speech started at age 2.5 . He speaks well and can count and use money . He can dress and wash independently and perform day-to-day tasks such as answering the tele-phone . He has no history of epilepsy , and just mild ID . His sister , V 3 , a 23-year-old , has slight developmental delay , but it is more severe than that of her brother , and she shows aggressive behavior . She can dress and wash independently but can not count or use money . Her speech is less advanced than her brother’s . She has no history of epilepsy . Her older sister , V 2 , age 25 years , was more delayed than her younger siblings . She began walking at 4 years . She speaks in sentences but can not count or use money . She has problems with overeating and aggression and has a history of generalized epilepsy . Study of photo-graphs of affected individuals from this family suggested common facial features , including a flat philtrum and prominent nose . However , because photographs of other family members were not available , these can not be excluded as familial traits , and the family is categorized as nonsyndromic see Tables 1 and 2 . When all the Pakistani and Iranian families are taken into consideration , a combined critical region spanning nucleotides 137,667,734–139,653,199 ~2.0 Mb was likely to harbor a gene in which mutations lead to NS-ARID see Figure 2 . This critical region contains 82 RefSeq coding genes UCSC hg18 March 2006 . For the Iranian family , we performed next-generation sequencing by enrichment of the exonic regions within the linkage interval by using a custom Agilent SureSelect array , followed by sequencing with the Illumina Genome Analyzer II platform . Analysis of prospective changes from the critical region indicated DNA variants in just three genes GPSM1 [ MIM 609491 ] one base pair deleted at Chr9 139,235,486 hg19 RefSeq number NM_015597.4 c.1243 delA [ p . Thr415Glnfs*55 ] , SOHLH1 [ MIM 610224 ] missense change c. 916C A [ p.Leu306Met ] RefSeq number NM_001101677.1 and MAN1B1 [ MIM 604346 ] missense change c.1000C T [ p.Arg334Cys ] RefSeq numberNM_016219.3 .However , only the MAN1B1 change segregated in pedigree 8600060 . This change , which occurs in exon 7 , was not present in 155 Iranians or 191 Germans . For the Pakistani families , a number of genes were selected as candidates for sequencing , but sequence anal-ysis excluded INPP5E [ MIM 613037 ] , GRIN1 [ MIM 138249 ] , ABCA2 [ MIM 600047 ] , CACN1AB , EHTM1 , KCNT1 [ MIM 608167 ] , CAMSAP1 , OLFM1 [ MIM 605336 ] , GLT6D1 [ MIM 613699 ] , SEC16A [ MIM 612854 ] , LHX3 [ MIM 600577 ] , ANAPC2 [ MIM 606946 ] , PNPLA7 [ MIM 612122 , and TUBB2C [ MIM 602660 ] . Sequence analysis of GPSM1 , SOHLH1 , and MAN1B1 was then undertaken . The same 1 bp deletion was observed in GPSM1 in an affected member of MR43 , however this did not segregate , and it was present in homozygous form in an unaffected sibling . This deletion occurs within the last exon of GPSM1 , but the location is only present within the coding region for one of the four known isoforms of the gene RefSeq UCSC Hg18 , March 2006 and is either within intron 9 or upstream for the other isoforms . No changes were found in SOHLH1 , but a missense mutation in exon 8 and a nonsense mutation in exon 9 were found in MAN1B1 for MR7 , MR8 , MR9 NM_016219.3 c. 1189G A [ p.Glu397Lys ] , and MR43 NM_016219.3 c.1418G A [ p.Trp473* ] , respectively . Both the Arg334 and Glu397 residues are conserved across evolution of the animal kingdom Figure 1 . Further-more , these residues are also conserved across paralogous sequences that are known to have similar enzymatic func-tions but in different cellular contexts Figure 3 . The c.1189G A substitution creates a StyI restriction endonu-clease cutting site , and the c.1418G A destroys a BamHI restriction site . We used PCR followed by either StyI or BamH1 digestion to screen a cohort of 252 Pakistani controls , but the mutant alleles were not detected . None of the three MAN1B1 substitutions have been reported in any SNP databases to date and were not present in the 1000 Genomes Version 60.37e . MAN1B1 encodes the protein endoplasmic reticulum mannosyl-oligosaccharide1,2-alpha-mannosidase ERManI EC ? 3.2.1.113 . ERManI and other class 1 a-mannosidases are members of the glycosyl hydrolase family 47 GH47 , are believed to be key enzymes involved in the maturation of N-glycans in the secretory pathway , 7,8 and contribute to the timing and disposal of misfolded glycoproteins through the endoplasmic-reticulum-associated degrada-tion pathway.9 Enzyme activity involves a direct Ca2 ? -mediated interaction between the enzyme and substrate , 8 and the protein forms an aa barrel structure with the 7 Ca2 ? ion bound at the core of an active-site pocket in the center of the barrel.9 The Arg334 residue , which is mutated in the Iranian family , is believed to be located at the base of the active-site pocket.9 The Glu397 residue , which is mutated in the Pakistani MR7 , MR8 , and MR9 families , is also located at this active-site pocket , where it interacts with glycan substrates see Figure 4 also see Movie S1 .9 Arg334 interacts via hydrogen bonding with the 40 OH on the glycone in the 1 subsite , and the Glu397 residue is involved in hydrogen bonding to the 60 OH of the ? 1 mannose residue . Each of these interactions probably makes a minor energetic contribution relative to others in the active site , 10 but the p.Arg334Cys mutation might alter the electrostatics in the active site in ways that are not easily predicted . The p.Glu397Lys mutation is likely to be disrupt-ing , partially because of the loss of hydrogen bonding to the side chain but also because the longer Lys side chain would probably provide steric hindrance to docking of the ? 1 residue . Thus , both missense mutations would probably interfere indirectly with the enzyme’s ability to bind and recognize the appropriate oligosaccharide substrate . The cDNA encoding the MAN1B1 catalytic domain was used for site-directed mutagenesis , as described previously.9 The constructs were used for transient transfection of HEK293 cells . The wild-type wt construct was secreted well and was purified on a Ni2 ? -NTA column however , the Cys334 construct was expressed and secreted at ~20 % of that of wt levels , and Lys397 was expressed and secreted at 5 % of wt levels . Although the amount of expressed protein for the Lys397 mutant was too low for enzyme activity to be measured , kinetic analysis of the Cys334 mutant indicated a 1327-fold reduction in kcat , a 6.4-fold reductioninKm , anda205-folddecreaseinKcat Km Table3 . It is highly probable that these missense mutations destabilize the protein and thus negatively affect folding and secretion . The Trp473 nonsense mutation identified in family MR43 is thus likely to result in a truncated form of the protein missing many of the residues required for substrate recognition , as well as the Ca2 ? -binding Thr688 residue . Furthermore , it occurs in exon 9 of a 13 exon gene and therefore most likely leads to nonsense-mediated RNA decay so that only a little mRNA , if any , would survive to protein translation . However , mRNA was not available from any MR43 family members , and as such , we were unable to confirm this experimentally . The lysosomal-storage disease mannosidosis MIM 248500 for a mannosidosis MIM 245100 for b mannosido-sis is an autosomal-recessive condition caused by muta-tions within genes for lysosomal a-mannosidase enzyme MAN2B1 MIM 609458 and lysosomal b-mannosidase enzyme MANBA MIM 609489 . Alpha-mannosidosis is a rare condition , with an estimated prevalence between 1 500,000 and 1 750,000,11,12 and it varies in severity from prenatal lethal forms to late-onset forms with slow progression . The main features are intellectual disability , Wild -type 1.31 5 0.24 133 5 4 9850 1 Cys334 0.000987 5 0.000015 20.6 5 1.3 47.9 0.00486 hearing loss , myopathy , skeletal abnormalities , and facial dysmorphic features , as well as vulnerability to infections see GeneReviews in Web Resources . Brain magnetic reso-nance imaging MRI of a-mannosidosis patients typically show white-matter abnormalities as well as cerebellar atrophy and other structural anomalies see GeneReviews in Web Resources . b -mannosidosis is even rarer , and clinical features include intellectual disability , behavioral abnormalities , and hearing loss occasionally , there is also facial dysmorphism , skeletal deformation , susceptibility to respiratory infections , and skin lesions.14 The clinical features of the four families identified with MAN1B1 missense mutations indicate nonsyndromic ARID because only mild dysmorphic features that could not be excluded as family traits were observed , whereas clear dysmorphic features were noted for the family with the nonsense muta-tion MR43 see Table 2 photos of patients from MR7 IV 5 , IV 6 , MR8 IV 2 , MR9 II 1 , II 3 , and MR43 VI 4 , VI 5 , as well as individuals V-1 , V 2 , and V 3 from family 8600060 , were examined by R.W. . A more detailed physical exami-nation might be required in order to reveal more subtle anomalies . Thus , we believe that mutation of this endoplasmic reticulum mannosidase gene results in NS-ARID rather than mannosidosis , and thus the disease mechanism is different from disease-causing mutations in the lysosomal a and b mannosidase genes MAN2B1 and MANBA . The identification of mutations causing NS-ARID in MAN1B1 suggests that the ER-associated degradation ERAD path-way is a new disease-associated pathway , and this leads us to further speculate that disruption of other ERAD pathway molecules might result in similar clinical presen-tation . Thus , mutations in MAN1B1 have been found to cause NS-ARID . Furthermore , this is one of the rare cases of NS-ARID genes with increased mutation frequency , and it is tempting to speculate that future investigations into the molecular causes of NS-ARID in larger numbers of patients might demonstrate that disruption of MAN1B1 accounts for more than one percent of the patients .

21771975	OBJECTIVE—The plasma adiponectin level , a potential up-stream and internal facet of metabolic and cardiovascular diseases , has a reasonably high heritability . Whether other novel genes influence the variation in adiponectin level and the roles of these genetic variants on subsequent clinical outcomes has not been thoroughly investigated . Therefore , we aimed not only to identify genetic variants modulating plasma adiponectin levels but also to investigate whether these variants are associated with adiponectin-related metabolic traits and cardiovascular diseases . RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS—We conducted a genome-wide association study GWAS to identify quantitative trait loci QTL associated with high molecular weight forms of adiponectin levels by genotyping 382 young-onset hypertensive YOH subjects with Illumina HumanHap550 SNP chips . The culpable single nucleotide polymorphism SNP variants respon-sible for lowered adiponectin were then confirmed in another 559 YOH subjects , and the association of these SNP variants with the risk of metabolic syndrome MS , type 2 diabetes mellitus T2DM , and ischemic stroke was examined in an independent community– based prospective cohort , the CardioVascular Disease risk FACtors Two-township Study CVDFACTS , n 3,350 . RESULTS—The SNP rs4783244 most significantly associated with adiponectin levels was located in intron 1 of the T-cadherin CDH13 gene in the first stage P 7.57 3 1029 . We replicated and confirmed the association between rs4783244 and plasma adiponectin levels in an additional 559 YOH subjects P 5.70 3 10217 . This SNP was further associated with the risk of MS odds ratio [ OR ] 1.42 , P 0.027 , T2DM in men OR 3.25 , P 0.026 , and ischemic stroke OR 2.13 , P 0.002 in the CVDFACTS . CONCLUSIONS—These findings indicated the role of T-cadherin in modulating adiponectin levels and the involvement of CDH13 or adiponectin in the development of cardiometabolic diseases . Diabetes 60 2417–2423 , 2011 A diponectin plays vital roles in modulating in-sulin sensitivity , glucose homeostasis , lipid metabolism , and antiatherosclerotic and anti-inflammatory responses in the vascular system 1,2 . The concentration of adiponectin , the most abundant adipokine secreted by adipocytes , ranges from 4 to 30 mg mL in the blood , which is much higher than the concen-trations of various other hormones and cytokines 3 . Decreased levels of plasma adiponectin are associated with an increased risk of not only obesity 4 and meta-bolic syndrome MS 5 but also type 2 diabetes mellitus T2DM 6 , hypertension 7 , myocardial infarction 8 , and ischemic stroke 9 . Animal studies and cell culture experiments have shown that direct stimulation of nitric oxide synthesis is responsible for the anti-inflammatory mechanism and antiatherogenic effects of adiponectin 10 . These findings give biological plausibility to the phe-nomenon that the decreased plasma levels of adiponectin may directly lead to the development of insulin re-sistance , diabetes , and cardiovascular disease CVD and not merely be a consequence of the MS . Therefore , understanding the genetic mechanisms involved in the modulation of plasma adiponectin levels in the human body will provide insights into the cause and manage-ment of MS . The plasma adiponectin levels , a potential upstream and internal facet of metabolic disease and CVD 11 , have a reasonably high heritability with an estimated range of 40– 80 % 12,13 . Although the ADIPOQ and ARL15 genes iden-tified by genome-wide association studies GWAS have been associated with adiponectin levels in white popu-lations 14–16 , whether other genes influence the changes in adiponectin level and the roles of these genetic variants on subsequent clinical outcomes , including MS , T2DM , and coronary artery disease , has not been carefully investi-gated , especially in Asian populations . We performed a GWAS to identify the quantitative trait loci QTL regulating the adiponectin levels by us-ing phenotypic and genotypic information of 941 young-onset hypertensive YOH subjects , including the Illumina HumanHap550 SNP data for the initial 382 subjects . Three single nucleotide polymorphism SNP variants respon-sible for lowered adiponectin levels showed genome-wide significance in both the first-stage with 382 YOH cases and the second-stage with 559 YOH cases studies sub-sequently , we determined the association of these SNP variants with the risk of MS , T2DM , and ischemic stroke in an independent large-scale , community-based prospective cohort study , the CardioVascular Disease risk FACtors Two-township Study CVDFACTS . RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS GWAS using the data collected for YOH patients to determine QTL influencing the plasma adiponectin levels . We performed a two-stage Prospective study to determine the association between QTL of adiponectin and metabolic traits , T2DM , and ischemic stroke . The RESULTS Characteristics of subjects in the Academia Sinica Multicentered Young-Onset Hypertension Genetic Study . No significant differences were observed between subjects in the first and second stages Table 1 with respect to sex distribution , mean levels of LDL and adiponectin , and proportion of smoking status . Significant differences were noted in the mean age and BMI of the subjects . The subjects in the second stage were 4 years older than those in the first stage , but the magnitude of the difference in BMI was small . GWAS findings . The results of principal component anal-ysis in stage 1 revealed no evidence for population stratifi-cation for hypertensive subjects . Multidimensional scaling analysis using PLINK also showed similar results Supple-mentary Fig. 1 . To identify the QTLs influencing the adiponectin levels , we performed GLM with adjustments for age , sex , BMI , and smoking to reduce the potential confounding effects . The major results of the GWAS for adiponectin levels are shown in Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. 2 . The SNP TABLE 1 Characteristics of the study subjects in the first two stages Characteristic Initial stage Second stage P† n 382 559 Male % 68 69 0.67 Age years 38.4 6 0.4 42.9 6 0.2 , 0.0001 BMI kg m2 26.2 6 0.2 26.7 6 0.1 0.03 LDL mg dL 126.2 6 1.7 126.2 6 1.3 0.97 Adiponectin mg mL 4.1 6 0.23 4.2 6 0.17 0.81 Smoking status % 21.9 24.7 0.36 Data are given in percentage or mean 6 SE . †A t or x2 test was used to make comparisons between the first-and second-stage samples in the GWAS with a significance level set at P 0.05 . rs4783244 most significantly associated with adiponectin levels was located in intron 1 of the CDH13 gene P 7.57 3 1029 this SNP was selected for the second-stage confir-matory study , because no other SNPs had a –log P value greater than 7 . In addition to the most significant SNP rs4783244 , two SNPs located at promoter rs7193788 P 4.88 3 1025 and intron 1 of CDH13 locus rs8047711 P 4.10 3 1026 were also selected based on the location of SNPs and P value of the genome-wide scan . We selected these three candidate SNPs for confirmation in the second stage by examining an additional 559 YOH patients . The three SNPs again showed significant associations with adiponectin levels Table 2 rs4783244 P 5.70 3 10217 , rs8047711 P 6.32 3 1028 , and rs7193788 P 1.36 3 1029 . The SNP rs4783244 that showed the most significant association accounted for 9.28 % of the total variance of adiponectin levels in the combined data analysis of 941 hypertensive subjects Table 2 , which was more signifi-cant than the other two SNPs . We further examined the association for loci previously reported in the GWAS or candidate gene study . We did not observe the associations with SNPs in ADIPOQ rs16861194 and rs3774262 , P 0.648 and P 0.529 ARL15 rs4311394 , P 0.027 ADIPOR1 rs10753929 , P 0.03 , and ADIPOR2 rs4766413 , P 0.128 after multiple testing corrections Table 2 . Association between rs4783244 in CDH13 and meta - bolic traits . Because of a strong linkage disequilibrium among these three SNPs in the CDH13 gene D9 1 among three SNPs , we selected the most significant SNP , rs4783244 , to further determine its association with other metabolic parameters , including hypertension , waist cir-cumference WC , and the levels of HDL-cholesterol , TG , and FG for the samples in CVDFACTS . The SNP rs4783244 was significantly associated with WC P 0.014 and the levels of TG P 0.010 and FG P 0.024 , whereas it was not significantly associated with HDL-cholesterol levels and hypertension in the CVDFACTS samples Table 3 . The GG genotype of rs4783244 was associated with WC , a low adiponectin level , a high level of TG and FG , and an increased risk of MS odds ratio [ OR ] 1.42 [ CI 1.04–1.95 ] , P 0.0273 Table 3 . No significant associations were observed between the genotypes of rs4783244 and HOMA-IR or T2DM without stratification of the sex data not shown . However , in the male subgroup , the SNP rs4783244 was significantly asso-ciated with HOMA-IR P 0.033 . The HOMA-IR levels increased with the number of the G allele of rs4783244 in a dominant fashion GG and GT genotypes of rs4783244 were significantly associated with T2DM in a similar manner OR 3.25 [ CI 1.15–9.19 ] , P 0.0259 and OR 3.50 [ 1.24–9.8 ] , P 0.0184 , respectively Table 4 . However , none of the associations with HOMA-IR and T2DM were detected in the female subgroup . We further conducted a test for the rs4783244* interactions between the sexes . We observed a statistically significant interaction effect between the rs4783244 genotypes and sex P for in-teraction 0.05 . Because a higher proportion of smokers are men than women , 1 % , we investigated whether it is in smokers that rs4783244 exacts its effect . However , we TABLE 2 found that there was no interaction between smoking and rs4783244 in men P for interaction 0.159 . Association between rs4783244 in CDH13 and IMT and the risk of ischemic stroke . Results from the GLM with adjustments for sex , age , and smoking showed that the mean IMT was associated with rs4783244 P 0.048 . The mean IMT increased with the GG genotype of rs4783244 in a recessive fashion P 0.026 . We further compared the risk of ischemic stroke between people with GG and people with combined TT and GT genotypes . Similar to the findings for IMT , the risk of ischemic stroke increased with the GG genotype of rs4783244 OR , 2.13 [ CI 1.33–3.39 ] , P 0.002 Table 5 . To summarize , the G allele at rs4783244 was consistently associated with deleterious states of the five metabolic traits examined and with an increased risk of MS , T2DM in men , and ischemic stroke . DISCUSSION We performed a GWAS for high molecular weight forms of adiponectin levels and found a QTL on CDH13 that affects adiponectin levels . This adiponectin QTL was recently TABLE 3 reported for Filipinos by Wu et al. 22 and Koreans by Jee et al. 23 . We are the first to find this adiponectin QTL in Chinese and to show that this QTL was associated with met-abolic traits and the risk of MS , T2DM in men , and stroke . These findings may broaden our understanding of the mech-anisms modulating adiponectin levels and the role of adipo-nectin in the development of metabolic disease and CVD . Several GWAS have been performed for adiponectin levels . Wu et al. 22 and Jee et al. 23 found that SNP-rs3865188 on the CDH13 locus was associated with high molecular weight forms of adiponectin levels in an Asian population . The rs4783244 D9 0.94 r 2 0.9 SNP found in our study was in strong linkage disequilibrium with this SNP . Another family study 15 revealed that rs7195409 which did not reach a genome-wide signifi-cance on intron 7 of the CDH13 locus potentially affects adiponectin levels in subjects of northern and western European origin . We tried to compare allele frequencies of 10 previously reported associated SNPs in the ADIPOQ gene 22 between Asians and Europeans . No polymor-phisms were found for two of them in Asians , namely , rs17300539 and rs17366568 . Allele frequencies of the other eight SNPs differed from Europeans by 3–16 % . Mean 6 SD OR 95 % CI TABLE 4 TABLE 5 rs4783244 P Mean 6 SD n OR 95 % CI Only one of the eight is included in the Illumina Infinium II HumanHap550 SNP chips . We did not have the opportu-nity to study the association between these seven SNPs and adiponectin levels . In addition to the polymorphisms at the ADIPOQ locus 14–16 , a previous study 16 revealed that ARL15 , whose functions were unknown , influenced circu-lating adiponectin levels and moderately increased the risk of coronary heart disease . We showed that a variant of CDH13 , but not that of ADIPOQ and ARL15 , was associ-ated with adiponectin levels . This discrepancy in results may be explained by population-specific genetic variants , limited sample sizes to detect the modest associations , and varied coverage of different whole-genome SNP–genotyping platforms . Similar to our study , the small scale study con-ducted by Jee et al. 23 in Korea did not show an associ-ation between adiponectin levels and ADIPOQ or ARL15 . Our study further showed that the CDH13 variant had moderate effects on metabolic traits and on the increased risk of MS , T2DM , and ischemic stroke . CDH13 is located at chromosome 16q24 24 and encodes the cadherin-related superfamily of transmembrane proteins that me-diate calcium-dependent intercellular adhesion . CDH13 is highly expressed in several tissues heart , aortic wall , neurons of the brain cortex and spinal cord , and small blood vessels and in a variety of cell types vascular endothelial cells , smooth muscle cells , pericytes , cardiomyocytes , and cancer cells 25–28 . Studies on cellular signaling have suggested that both LDL and adiponectin were specific ligands for T-cadherin , a product of CDH13 29–31 . Binding of LDL or adiponectin to T-cadherin is capable of activating nuclear factor-kB NF-kB signaling pathway 29 , which plays a central role in inflammation and serves as a link between obesity and vascular disease 32 . T-cadherin ex-pression in the arterial wall after balloon angioplasty is as-sociated with late stages of neointima formation and with the peak of proliferation and differentiation of vascular cells 33 . This evidence suggests that T-cadherin , by modulating the levels of adiponectin in the blood and in various tissues , may regulate vascular remodeling , neointima formation , and inflammation-related phenomena and atherosclerosis development . Two additional adiponectin receptors have been identified in the skeletal muscle AdipoR1 and liver AdipoR2 by expression cloning 34 . Both receptors acti-vate adenosine monophosphate–activated protein kinase and peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor a meta-bolic pathways that mediate the major metabolic effects of adiponectin , such as those on glucose uptake and fatty-acid oxidation , which are critical components in the de-velopment of obesity , T2DM , and CVD 35,36 . T-cadherin not only competes with adiponectin receptors R1 and R2 for adiponectin binding but also interferes with the coupling of both receptors to their downstream intracellular targets 37 . All of these data provide evidence of the role of CDH13 and of the complexity in the development of car-diometabolic diseases . In an attempt to dissect the interrelationship among CDH13 , obesity , and cardiometabolic diseases , we included BMI as a covariate . Our data show that the direction of association between all components of MS and rs4783244 remained the same , but they were no longer statistically significant , indicating that the genetic effects of CDH13-rs4783244 on these metabolic traits may be mediated in part by BMI . However , the P value for the association with stroke , MS , and diabetes remained significant at 0.0035 , rs4783244 0.026 , and 0.03 , respectively . These findings indicate that rs4783244 has its independent effects on MS comorbidity , stroke , and diabetes . An association between rs4783244 and HOMA-IR T2DM was found in men but not in women . A question arises whether smoking plays any role to augment the effect of this polymorphism in men . Smoking has been known to be as-sociated with increased oxidative stress that induces pro-duction of inflammatory cytokines , resulting in endothelial dysfunction and increasing the risk for atherosclerosis 38 . The interaction between adiponectin and its receptor CDH13 may trigger the NF-kB signaling pathway and in turn affect the development of cardiometabolic diseases , also via the inflammatory pathway . Smoking may interact with CDH13-rs4783244 and affect the development of cardiometabolic diseases . However , no significant interaction between rs4783244 and smoking was found for T2DM and stroke in men in our study . Among alternative reasons for the dif-ference between the sexes is that plasma adiponectin levels generally are higher in women than in men 39 , which may protect women more against T2DM . Because we did not measure adiponectin levels in the CVDFACTS , we could not examine how the sex interacts with adiponectin level to affect the risk of T2DM . Our study has some other limitations . First , this GWAS was performed in hypertensive subjects . Further studies should be performed in the general population . Second , the number of subjects in our study is generally regarded as small for a GWAS . However , the power for identifying QTLs of adiponectin levels is in general greater than that in complex diseases . A moderate association was also observed between SNP rs11068544 on chromosome 12 and adiponectin levels P value 1.78 3 1026 . This SNP lies in intron 5 of kinase suppressor of ras 2 KSR2 , which acts as a negative reg-ulator of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 3 MAP3K3 -mediated activation of extracellular signal–related kinase ERK , Jun NH2-terminal kinase , and NF-kB path-ways , inhibiting the MAP3K3-mediated proinflammatory pathway and downregulated mitogen-activated protein kinase ERK kinase kinase 3-induced interleukin-8 production in response to interleukin-1B stimulation 40 . Although the magnitude of association did not reach genome-wide thresh-old for statistical significance , KSR2 also stimulates fatty acids oxidation via the adenosine monophosphate–activated pro-tein kinase pathway . These features may make the KSR2 gene a promising candidate for adiponectin levels regula-tion . Further large-scale confirmatory studies will be re-quired to clarify this association . In conclusion , our study provides evidence that a GWAS has the potential to reveal genetic influences on a clear biochemical trait such as adiponectin levels . We have im-plicated that CDH13 has an influence not only on adipo-nectin levels in the blood but also on the risk of MS , T2DM , and ischemic stroke . These findings support the patho-genic role of CDH13 in metabolic diseases and in athero-thrombotic stroke and suggest the potential application of CDH13 as a target for disease prevention and management .

Introduction DNA methylation and histone modifications , which constitute the major means of epigenetic regulations , are reversible via various pathological circumstances or environmental changes Jaenisch and Bird , 2003 . The susceptibility of epigenetic modifications to extrinsic factors suggests that genomic repeats as well as specific loci are subject to epigenetic alterations during aging . The altered gene expression profile reported in various tissues of aged organisms Park and Prolla , 2005 supports the possibility that epigenetic modifica-tions are changed throughout the genome along with age . The link between epigenetic alterations and the aging process has been proposed anecdotally Fraga and Esteller , 2007 . DNA methylation changes at repetitive DNA elements during aging have been studied in several tissues of organisms Oakes et al. , 2003 Rath and Kanungo , 1989 . It is still necessary to investigate DNA methylation over a wide range of repeat classes for better characterization of dynamic changes in methylation states during normal aging . To completely understand age-dependent epigenetic dysregulations at genomic repeats , it is essential to determine whether histone marks at repetitive sequences change over time as individuals age . Repetitive DNA elements are dispersed throughout the genome so that such sequences are even found close to mammalian genes . The proximity of the genomic repeats indicates that repetitive DNA elements serve as alternative promoters or putative cis-regulators for adjacent loci . Indeed , genomic repeats have been believed to be one of the driving forces that creates new genes and cis-acting elements St Laurent et al. , 2010 . The potential regulatory functions of retrotransposons were recently demonstrated on a genome scale Faulkner et al. , 2009 . Increasing evidence supports the hypothesis that simple tandem repeats as well as transposable elements can provide regulatory signals to protein-coding and non-coding genes Tomilin , 2008 . Studies on age-associated epigenetic changes at repetitive sequences Oakes et al. , 2003 Rath and Kanungo , 1989 thus help elucidate the transcriptional alteration of repeat proximal genes including RDTs during aging . Furthermore , epigenetic changes at repeat sequences can explain at least in part the age-dependent gene expression profile , since numerous mammalian transcripts are initiated from repetitive DNA elements Faulkner et al. , 2009 . In the present study , we determined whether DNA methylation and histone modifications at repeat elements were associated with age . The transcription of RDTs may be related to epigenetic states at repeat sequences , according to the functions of repetitive DNA element mentioned above . To test this hypothesis , mRNA levels of several RDTs were examined . Epigenetic statuses at the repeats of the RDT promoter region were then investigated to establish the direct link between epigenetic alterations at repetitive sequences and changes of RDT expression during the course of normal aging . 2 . Materials and methods 2.1 . Animals and tissue collection C57BL 6J mice were kept in a specific pathogen free system . Mice that had any detectable abnormalities after tissue collection were excluded . Mice of both genders were sacrificed at the ages of 4 , 30 , 60 and 100 weeks . In our mouse colony , the maximum lifespan of this strain is about 145 weeks and the median lifespan is about 120 weeks . Tissues were obtained and frozen in liquid nitrogen immediately , and stored at -80 °C for future study . Mice were handled in accordance with protocols of the KAIST Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee IACUC . 2.2 . McrBC-Quantitative real time PCR qPCR assay The methylation status at repeat DNA elements in the mouse genome was analyzed by McrBC-qPCR assay as described previously Martens et al. 2005 . Genomic DNA was isolated from frozen mice tissues with a standard procedure . The isolated genomic DNA 5 ? g was digested with McrBC New England Biolabs that specifically cleaves methylated sequences . The methylation level was determined by qPCR with primers for repeat sequences , including intracisternal A particle IAP , short interspersed nucleotide elements SINEs , long interspersed nucleotide elements LINEs , and rDNA . qPCR was performed with iQ SYBR Green SUPERMIX Bio-rad using the iCycler iQ™ multicolor real-time detection system Bio-rad . The results were analyzed based on the threshold cycle Ct value . Primers for various repeat classes are described in Table S1 . 2.3 . DNA dot blot assay The DNA dot blot assay was performed as previously described Park et al. , 2005 . Genomic DNA 2 ? g was denatured with 0.4 N NaOH , 10 mM EDTA at 100 °C for 10 min . The denatured DNA samples were neutralized with cold 2 M ammonium acetate pH 7.0 and then dotted onto a Hybond™-N+nitrocellulose membrane Amersham Pharmacial Biotech using a S S Minifold I Dot-Blot System Scheleicher Schuell . The pre-treated DNA was fixed to the membrane in an Ultraviolet crosslinker with 1200 J of energy and incubated in a 5 % skim milk Tris-buffered saline+Tween 20 TBST blocking solution for 2 h . The membrane was probed with a 1 3000 dilution of mouse monoclonal primary antibody Abcam specific against 5-methyl-cytosine 5-MeC overnight 12–16 h , washed with TBST 5 times for 10 min and incubated with a 1 3000 dilution of HRP-conjugated secondary anti-mouse IgG antibody Santa Cruz , catalog no . sc-2005 for 2 h . The membrane was washed again , treated with ECL plus western blotting detection reagent Millipore . The relative dot intensity was measured with a densitometer Kodak . Equal loading of the genomic DNA was indicated by the equal intensity of 0.02 % methylene blue staining . 2.4 . Chromatin immunoprecipitation ChIP -qPCR assay ChIP was performed according to the protocol provided by Upstate Biotechnology Upstate Biotech . Briefly , frozen mice tissues were homogenized in 10 ml of PBS . Formaldehyde was added to the samples to a final concentration of 1 % and the samples were incubated at 37 °C for 10 min . The treated samples were sonicated to fractionate the DNA and then immunoprecipitated with 5 ? l of anti-trimethyl-histone H3 Lys4 , anti-trimethyl-histone H3 Lys9 , anti-trimethyl-histone H3 Lys27 , anti-trimethyl-histone H4 Lys20 , anti-acetyl-histone H4 , anti-acetyl-histone H3 Lys9 18 Upstate Biotech , respectively . The precipitated protein–DNA complexes were reverse cross-linked , and DNA fragments were purified through phenol chloroform extraction . Purified DNA was used as templates for qPCR amplification . The results of ChIP-qPCR were analyzed using the percentage IP of input method based on the Ct value . Primer sequences are described in Table S1 . 2.5 . Western blot analysis Frozen tissues were homogenized and lysed in the lysis buffer containing 50 mM Tris pH8.0 , 150 mM NaCl , 1 % NP-40 , 5 mM EDTA , 1 mM PMSF , incubated on ice for 10 min and centrifuged at 13,000 ? g . The resulting supernatants were collected . Protein concentrations were determined with Bradford assay using Bio-Rad Protein Assay Bio-rad . Equal amount of proteins was boiled in 4 ? SDS sample buffer , subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane Millipore . After blocking the membrane with 5 % skim milk in TBST , the membrane was incubated overnight with appropri-ate dilutions of specific primary antibodies anti-acetyl-histone H4 , anti-acetyl-histone H3 Lys9 18 Upstate Biotech , anti- ? -tubulin Sigma . The membrane was washed with TBST 3 times for 10 min and incubated with HRP-conjugated secondary anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG antibodies Cell Signaling . Immunoreactive protein bands were detected with an ECL reagent Dae Myung Science Co. Ltd . 2.6 . Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR qRT-PCR Total RNA was isolated with the EasyBlue reagent Intron . One microgram of RNA was reverse-transcribed using the ImProm-II™ Reverse Transcription System Promega following the supplier s protocol . The results of qRT-PCR were analyzed based on the Ct value . All samples were normalized to Gapdh expression . qRT-PCR was performed with samples made without reverse transcriptase to confirm whether the extracted total RNA samples were contaminated by genomic DNA . There was no genomic DNA contamination in any of our total RNA samples data not shown . To accurately measure mRNA levels , most of the qRT-PCR primer pairs described in Table S1 were made covering at least two different exons of the target genes . 2.7 . Bisulfite sequencing Genomic DNA 2 ? g was digested with HindIII New England Biolabs . The digested DNA was treated with bisulfite using the EZ DNA Methylation kit Zymo Research . PCR products were cloned with pGEM-T Easy Vector system Promega and sequenced . Primers are common to the methylated and unmethylated DNA sequences . Primer sequences are described in Table S1 . 2.8 . Statistical analysis Two-tailed P-values were calculated using the two sample t-test assuming equal variances . The null hypotheses were rejected at the 0.05 level of significance for all tests . 3 . Results 3.1 . Repeat DNA elements are hypermethylated in the brains of old mice To test whether DNA methylation state at repetitive sequences is associated with age , the McrBC-qPCR assay was performed as described previously Martens et al. , 2005 . For this assay , highly methylated regions of DNA sequences are nearly completely digested after the incubation with McrBC , resulting in a small amount of PCR product . DNA methylation at three classes of retroelements which compose large parts of genomic repeats Druker and Whitelaw , 2004 was analyzed in five different tissues . The experiment included rDNA regions that showed age-dependent methylation changes Oakes et al. , 2003 Swisshelm et al. , 1990 . Most of investigated repeat regions and rDNA were hypermethylated in 100 week old mice brain except for L1 regions Fig. 1 . DNA methylation specifically at IAP gag regions was increased along with age in testis Fig. 1D , whereas IAP LTR regions in spleen and L1 5 ? UTR regions in thymus were hypomethy-lated during aging Fig. 1C , E . To examine whether DNA methylation at genomic repeats progressively changed in brain during the course of aging , the state of methylation was investigated with mice of additionally subdivided age groups . The results indicated that DNA methylation at repeats was differentially but not gradually changed throughout a lifetime depending on the class of repetitive elements Fig. S1 . Since the difference of DNA methylation at repeat sequences was prominent between 4 and 100 week old mice brains Fig. S1 , further experiments in the present study were conducted with tissues from mice of two different age groups 4 week old mice 4 w were used as the young group , and 100 week old mice 100 w were used as the aged group . To validate the results of the McrBC-qPCR assay , the IAP gag region was analyzed by bisulfite sequencing using L1 5 ? UTR as a negative control . The repeat elements were highly methylated as previously exemplified Matsui et al. , 2010 in the brains of both age groups Fig. S2 . The age-associated DNA hypermethylation at the IAP gag region was confirmed Fig. S2 . Measurements of the methylation status of repeat sequences have been used to examine global DNA methylation Dunn , 2003 . To explore whether the age-dependent hypermethylation at repetitive DNA elements is accompanied by changes of global DNA methylation levels , DNA dot blot assay was conducted using an antibody specific to 5-MeC . The results showed that global DNA methylation increased with hypermethylation at repeat sequences in mice brains during aging Fig. S3 , Table S2 . 3.2 . Histone modifications at retroelements are altered in aged mice brain The functional linkage between DNA methylation and histone modifications has been well described Hake et al. , 2004 . Altered chromatin modifications at repetitive DNA elements were accordingly expected in aged mice brain , since DNA hypermethylation at repeat sequences was detected in preceding experiments . To investigate histone markings at genomic repeats , cluster analysis using ChIP-qPCR Martens et al. , 2005 was performed . Activation as well as repression associated histone modifications Jenuwein and Allis , 2001 Mikkelsen et al. , 2007 was examined . Activation-associated chromatin markings were included in the analysis , since some of repetitive elements might be functionally in active states Faulkner et al. , 2009 Tomilin , 2008 . Primers for promoter regions of Gapdh glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and Zp3 zona pellu-cida glycoprotein 3 were used as negative controls for repressive and active histone modifications , respectively . The results of the cluster analysis showed that trimethyl lysine 9 histoneH3 H3K9me3 andtrimethyllysine27histoneH3 H3K27me3 were enriched at all of investigated retroelements Fig. 2A–B . The enrichment of trimethyl lysine 20 histone H4 H4K20me3 was detected at L1 3 ? UTR and IAP LTR regions but absent from SINE B1 elements Fig. 2C . The levels of H3K9me3 at L1 3 ? UTR regions and H4K20me3 atIAPLTR regionswere decreased in aged brains Fig. 2A , C . The analyses for active modifications revealed that trimethyl lysine 4 histone H3 H3K4me3 , acetyl lysine 9 18 histone H3 H3ac and acetyl histone H4 H4ac were enriched at retroelements Fig. 2D–F . The enrichment levels of H3ac and H4ac were reduced in the brains of old mice Fig. 2E–F , while the enrichments of H3K4me3 were relatively stable during aging Fig. 2D . Histone hypoacetylation at genomic repeats indicated that aged brains might exhibit reduced levels of acetyl histones . Western blot analysis revealed consistent levels of acetylated histone H3 and H4 proteins in brains at all ages Fig. S4 . 3.3 . Large numbers of analyzed RDTs are repressed in mice brains during aging A RDT is defined as a transcript , the 5 ? end of which resides within 100 bp from repeat sequences Fig. 3A , Table S3 . To test whether the observed epigenetic alterations at repetitive DNA classes are associ-ated with transcriptional changes of RDTs , qRT-PCR was performed for 25 RDTs selected without any chromosomal or positional biases . The results showed that 16 RDTs were down-regulated in aged mice brain . While eight RDTs exhibited constant levels of transcription , one was slightly up-regulated during aging Fig. 3B . A large number of microRNAs miRNAs were reported to be derived from genomic repeats Smalheiser and Torvik , 2005 . Among 568 annotated miRNAs precursors pre-miRNAs in the mouse genome , 137 pre-miRNAs that overlap at least 1 bp with repetitive sequences were found using the Galaxy application http galaxy . psu.edu Table S4 . Transcription levels of repeat-derived pre-miRNAs selected based on the definition of a RDT were measured . Target pre-miRNAs were invariably down-regulated in mice brain during aging Fig. 3C . Taken together , among coding and non-coding transcripts investigated , 70 % of RDTs were repressed in the brains of old mice . 3.4 . Histone hypoacetylation is related to the transcriptional repression of RDTs in mice brains during aging To test the direct correlation of the transcriptional repression of RDTs with the observed epigenetic changes at repetitive DNA elements , DNA methylation and histone marks at the repeats of the RDT promoter defined as±1 kb region from the 5 ? end of a transcript were analyzed . Eleven RDTs among 21 repressed transcripts were randomly chosen for bisulfite sequencing . CpG dinucleotide methylation patterns at the promoter region of investigated RDTs were mostly maintained during aging Fig. 4A , Fig. S5 . The retroelement of the Tfpi promoter region was extraordinarily hypermethylated in aged mice brain Fig. 4B . Among 21 repressed RDTs , one transcript possesses repetitive sequences without CpGs and three others contain repeats with few CpGs in the promoter region . The above observations strongly indicated that repetitive DNA hypermethylation was irrelevant to the transcrip-tional repression of RDTs . There still remains a possibility that DNA methylation at regions several kb upstream from the promoters can be functionally connected to the reduced transcription of RDTs . However , the methylation patterns at upstream regions of analyzed RDTs were faithfully preserved during the course of aging Fig. S6 . The result further supports the conclusion that DNA methylation is not involved in the transcriptional changes of investigated RDTs . Although several regions of repeat classes are hypermethylated in old mice brains Fig. 1 , Fig. S1 and Fig. S2 , the observed CpGs methylation patterns at repetitive DNA of RDT promoter regions Fig. 4A , Fig. S5 clearly suggest that DNA methylation is not the cause of the reduced transcript levels Fig. 3B–C . The results prompted us to test whether altered histone modifications are related to the repression of RDTs . Chromatin states at the promoter regions of 7 repressed RDTs were analyzed by ChIP-qPCR assay . Repressive histone modifications including H3K9me3 , H3K27me3 , and H4K20me3 were not detected data not shown . The analyzed repressive marks are very well-known for enrichment at heterochromatic regions and at the promoters of transcriptionally inactive genes Jenuwein and Allis , 2001 Mikkelsen et al. , 2007 . The absence of repressive modifications was expected since qRT-PCR results showed that investigated RDTs were quite well expressed in mice brain tissues Fig. 3B–C . The assay for active histone marks showed that the investigated modifications including H3K4me3 , H3ac and H4ac were enriched at all of analyzed promoter regions with the exception of the H4ac enrichment at D17H6S56E-5 promoter region Fig. 5 . The levels of these active modifications are invariably decreased at all investigated regions with age , though the enrichments are quite variable among analyzed transcripts Fig. 5 . Many factors , such as DNA methylation Jaenisch and Bird , 2003 , histone modifications Jenuwein and Allis , 2001 , miRNAs mediated-degradation Smalheiser and Torvik , 2005 , premature polyadenylation St Laurent et al. , 2010 , RNA editing Maas , 2010 , transcription regulators Rada-Iglesias et al. , 2011 have been shown to be involved in transcriptional gene regulations . The results of the experiments described above do not exclude all other possibilities but indicate that the reduction of active histone modifications might be one of factors responsible for the repression of RDTs during aging . 4 . Discussion The observations reported here revealed altered DNA methylation and histone markings at repeat elements during normal aging . DNA methylation has been known for decades to show changes at repetitive sequences with age in various tissues of organisms Oakes et al. , 2003 Rath and Kanungo , 1989 . The changes of methylation varied according to repeat classes Jintaridth and Mutirangura , 2010 . In the present study , to characterize compre-hensively this age-associated phenomenon , DNA methylation state was investigated at repetitive elements in several mice tissues . Repetitive DNA hypermethylation seemed to occur at a particular time in life according to the repeat class in mouse brain during aging Fig. S1 . The methylation status of repetitive elements has been shown to correlate with global DNA methylation Dunn , 2003 . The relationship was confirmed in mice brain Fig. S3 , Table S2 . Histone marks at retroelements were then analyzed to investigate age-dependent alterations in mice brain . The significant levels of repression-associated chromatin modifications , as previously exem-plified Matsui et al. , 2010 Mikkelsen et al. , 2007 , and activation-associated histone modifications at repeat DNA elements were both detected Fig. 2 . An explanation for the enrichment of active chromatin modifications at retroelements is that some genomic repeats are known to be functionally active Faulkner et al. , 2009 Tomilin , 2008 . Our data is supported by a recent genome-wide mapping study showing the enrichment of H3ac at repetitive sequences within gene promoter regions Roh et al. , 2005 . The cluster analysis indicated that histone hypoacetylation was the most prominent age-associated change among chromatin modifications examined Fig. 2E–F . It was hypothesized that transcriptions of genes close to genomic repeats could be influenced by epigenetic changes observed at repetitive sequences during aging . The majority of analyzed RDTs were down-regulated in the brains of old mice Fig. 3B–C . To correlate between epigenetic alterations at repeat DNA elements and this transcriptional repression , epigenetic states at the promoter region of RDTs were investigated . The distinguishing features at the repeat classes of the RDT promoter region in old mice brain were deacetylated histone H3 and H4 with reduced levels of H3K4me3 Fig. 5 . Histone hypoacetylation may be a consequence of the changes in RDTs expression , since histone H3 acetylation has been suggested to coincide with ongoing transcription Rybtsova et al. , 2007 . Histone H4 acetylation is thought to precede transcription and important for maintaining an open chromatin configuration Rybtsova et al. , 2007 Shogren-Knaak et al. , 2006 . Thus , at least histone H4 hypoacetylation appears to play an important role in the transcriptional repression of RDTs in aged mice brains . During aging , cell population changes which could affect observed epigenetic alterations at repeat classes might occur Walter et al. , 2009 . Considering the above issues , further studies are still required to establish the definitive mechanisms for changes in RDTs expression and histone hypoacetylation at genomic repeats . The current study was first aimed at revealing epigenetic de-regulations at repeat classes during aging . To adequately reveal age-dependent changes , 4 week old mice were used as the youngest group and 100 week old mice which sufficient to show age-associated deficits Peleg et al. , 2010 were used as the oldest group as previous studies Shen et al. , 2008 Yoon et al. , 2007 . Histone modifications were analyzed with these two groups , since prominent differences in DNA methylation at genomic repeats were observed Fig. S1 . Thus , whether chromatin modifications change similarly to the observed patterns of DNA methylation changes Fig. S1 remains an interesting question . So far , many studies including the present study have been performed regardless of gender of the experimental samples Maegawa et al. , 2010 Peleg et al. , 2010 . It is unclear whether epigenetic modifications at genomic repeat classes between male and female differ and whether the modifications at repeats change differentially via varying factors between the sexes . The sexual difference in epigenetic states during the process of aging or diseases is worth more investigation in the future , though it is not a consideration of this study . The McrBC-qPCR assay showed that DNA methylation at most repeat elements persisted Fig. 1 in spite of increased global DNA methylation levels in spleen and testis of old mice Fig. S3 , Table S2 . The results indicated that DNA methylation changed at alternative genomic loci other than tested regions of repetitive sequences in spleen and testis during aging . Evidences for tissue-specific , age-related DNA methylation changes are accumulating Maegawa et al. , 2010 . Impairments in spermatogenesis which involves the epige-netic reprogramming Ryu et al. , 2006 Surani et al. , 2008 may also be related to DNA hypermethylation in testis of aged mice . Tissue speci-fic differential levels of DNA methylation were observed Fig. S3 , Table S5 , though the DNA dot blot assay was unable to measure quantitatively accurate contents of 5-MeC . In conclusion , this study demonstrated that histone markings as well as DNA methylation at various repeat classes were associated with aging . Specifically , histone hypoacetylation at retroelements was observed in the brains of old mice . The alteration was revealed to correlate with changes in RDT transcription . The results propose one possible mechanism involved in the age-dependent gene expression . Histone hypoacetylation at repetitive sequences may be responsible at least in part for the altered gene expression profile in the brains of old mice , presumably because a large number of transcripts are derived from genomic repeats Faulkner et al. , 2009 . The present study also suggests that understanding the biological significance of repetitive DNA elements expands targets in the research area of diseases for their treatment and diagnosis . A loss of control of repetitive elements has been implicated in genetic diseases as well as cellular senescence and organismal aging St Laurent et al. , 2010 . Many studies reported that DNA hypomethylation at retrotranspo-sons induced aberrant transcripts initiated from repeat sequences in various cancers well known for age-related diseases Cruickshanks and Tufarelli , 2009 Druker and Whitelaw , 2004 . The expression profile of RDTs in a specific cancer can thus be exploited for iden-tifying diagnostic as well as prognostic markers .

21788571	RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS—Insulin release was [ Ca2+ ] i increases in rat b-cells in a PKA-dependent manner . 2324 , 2011 Gproducedhormone hrelin , an acylated 28-amino acid peptide , is the endogenous ligand for the growth hormone secretagogue receptor GHS-R 1,2 . Ghrelin is predominantly in the stomach and stimulates growth release and feeding and ex-hibits positive cardiovascular effects , suggesting its pos-sible clinical application 3 . Ghrelin and GHS-R are located in the pancreatic islets 4–6 . Furthermore , ghrelin O-acyltransferase GOAT , which has been identified as the enzyme that promotes the acylation of the third serine residue of ghrelin , is highly expressed in the pancreatic islets 7–9 . Administration of ghrelin at 1029–1028 mol L , the concentrations higher than the circulating levels of 10210–1029 mol L , attenuates insulin release and deterio-rates glucose tolerance in rodents and humans , whereas desacyl ghrelin has no effects 5,10,11 . This effective con-centration of ghrelin that is approximately one log order higher than the circulating level is considered physiological in the pancreatic islets for the following reasons 1 ghrelin is produced in the pancreatic islets 5 , and the ghrelin level in the pancreatic vein is one log order higher than that in the pancreatic artery 12 , indicative of release of ghrelin from the pancreas 2 ghrelin immunoneutralization and GHS-R antagonists augment glucose-induced insulin release from perfused pancreas and isolated islets 5,12 and 3 ghrelin knockout mice display enhanced glucose-induced insulin release from isolated islets without altering islet density and size , insulin content , or insulin mRNA levels , indicating in-creased secretory activity in the knockout mouse islets 12 . Furthermore , glucose intolerance in high-fat diet–induced obese DIO mice is prevented in the ghrelin knockout mice as a result of enhanced insulin secretory response to glucose 12 . These findings suggest that the islet-derived ghrelin regulates insulin release in a paracrine and or autocrine manner and that manipulation of the ghrelin action could provide a novel tool to optimize insulin release 13,14 . It is currently thought that GHS-R is coupled primar-ily to G11-phospholipase C signaling 2 . Intriguingly , our previous data indicated that the insulinostatic ghrelin signal-ing is produced via pertussis toxin PTX -sensitive G-protein Gai2 in b-cells ghrelin PTX-sensitively activates voltage-dependent K+ Kv channels , attenuates membrane excit-ability , and suppresses glucose-induced Ca2+ concentration [ Ca2+ ] i increases in b-cells to attenuate insulin release 15 . However , the mechanism that links GHS-R and Gai2 to these activities in b-cells remains to be clarified . It is known that PTX-sensitive Gi-proteins inhibit adenylate cyclase , which produces cyclic AMP in the cells . In pancreatic b-cells , in-tracellular cAMP signals are generated by nutrient secreta-gogues and play a critical role in regulating insulin secretion 16–18 . However , implication of cAMP signaling in the insu-linostatic function of ghrelin has been unclear . In this study , we aimed to clarify whether ghrelin regulates cAMP pathway in islet b-cells and whether this regulation leads to insulino-static cascade in islet b-cells . We here show a novel signaling mechanism for ghrelin that operates in islet b-cells GHS-R– mediated attenuation of cAMP and protein kinase-A PKA signaling leads to activation of Kv channels and suppression of glucose-induced [ Ca2+ ] i increase and insulin release . RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS FIG. 2 . Ghrelin attenuates glucose-induced insulin release in a cAMP pathway-dependent manner in rat isolated islets .

Perforated whole-cell RESULTS Ghrelin attenuates glucose-induced insulin release in a cAMP signaling-dependent manner . In rat perfused pancreas , the first and second phases of glucose 8.3 mmol L -induced insulin release were both significantly suppressed by exogenous ghrelin 10 nmol L that was administered 10 min prior to 8.3 mmol L glucose challenge and present through the end of experiments , whereas the basal insulin release at 2.8 mmol L glucose was not al-tered Fig. 1A and E , confirming a previous report 15 . In perfused pancreas of PTX-treated rats , both phases of glucose-induced insulin release were markedly enhanced , and ghrelin 10 nmol L failed to affect them Fig. 1B and E . A membrane-permeable cAMP analog , dibutyryl-cAMP db-cAMP , at 1 mmol L markedly enhanced both phases of glucose-induced insulin release , and in the presence of db-cAMP ghrelin failed to suppress both phases of insulin release Fig. 1C and E . In pancreas preincubated with an irreversible adenylate cyclase inhibitor , MDL-12330A 10 mmol L , both phases of glucose-induced insulin release were attenuated and were not further altered by adminis-tration of ghrelin 10 nmol L Fig. 1D and E . None of these treatments affected basal levels of insulin release at 2.8 mmol L glucose . Ghrelin 10 nmol L affected neither acetylcholine ACh 10 mmol L -induced Fig. 1F and G nor high K+ 25 mmol L KCl -induced insulin release in rat perfused pancreas at 2.8 mmol L glucose Fig. 1H and I . These results suggest that ghrelin selectively attenuates glucose-induced insulin release via PTX-sensitive G-protein that is coupled to modulation of cAMP signaling . Next , in rat isolated islets , 8.3 mmol L glucose-induced insulin release was inhibited by exogenous ghrelin Fig. 2 . The glucose-induced insulin release was enhanced by db-cAMP 1 mmol L . Moreover , 6-Phe-cAMP 10 mmol L , a membrane-permeable specific PKA activator , enhanced the glucose-induced insulin release . Ghrelin 10 nmol L failed to attenuate the insulin release in the presence of these cAMP analogs Fig. 2 . Conversely , the glucose-induced insulin re-lease was significantly suppressed by adenylate cyclase in-hibitor MDL-12330A 10 mmol L , and ghrelin did not affect the insulin release in the MDL-12330A-treated islets Fig. 2 . Ghrelin inhibits glucose-induced cAMP production in rat isolated islets . In the presence of PDE inhibitor IBMX 500 mmol L , static incubation of islets with 8.3 mmol L glucose induced modest cAMP productions in islets com-pared with those with 2.8 mmol L glucose P , 0.05 Fig. 3A . Incubation of islets with higher concentration 22 mmol L of glucose induced further increases in the cAMP levels . The glucose 8.3 and 22 mmol L -induced cAMP responses were significantly inhibited by exogenous ghrelin 10 nmol L and augmented by a GHS-R antagonist [ D-Lys3 ] -GHRP-6 1 mmol L Fig. 3A . These effects of exogenous and endogenous ghrelin were blunted in islets isolated from PTX-treated rats neither exogenous ghrelin 10 nmol L nor [ D-Lys3 ] -GHRP-6 1 mmol L affected the 8.3 mmol L glucose-induced cAMP productions , whereas 22 mmol L glucose in-duced further cAMP productions Fig. 3B . Moreover , immunoneutralization of endogenous ghrelin with an anti-ghrelin antiserum 0.1 % significantly enhanced the glucose-induced cAMP productions compared with the control with a normal rabbit serum 0.1 % Fig. 3C . Ghrelin suppresses glucose-induced [ cAMP ] i elevations in MIN6 b-cells . To determine the direct effect of ghrelin on the glucose-induced cAMP production , [ cAMP ] i were monitored in mouse b-cell line MIN6 cells transfected with a fluorescent-translocation biosensor using evanescent-wave microscopy . Raising the glucose concentration from 3 to 11 mmol L induced a rise in [ cAMP ] i in an oscillatory manner Fig. 3D . Ghrelin markedly suppressed the glucose-induced oscillatory rise in [ cAMP ] i Fig. 3D . Furthermore , in a MIN6 cell with pronounced oscillations of [ cAMP ] i during an 11 mmol L glucose challenge , the [ cAMP ] i oscillations were inhibited by administration of ghrelin and recovered by its washout Fig. 3E , showing the reversible effect of ghrelin . Average CFP-to-YFP ratio AUC time revealed that 11 mmol L glucose increased CFP-to-YFP ratio by 19 6 4 % and ghrelin significantly suppressed it Fig . 3F , indicating that ghrelin directly inhibits glucose-induced cAMP signaling in b-cells . Ghrelin suppresses glucose-induced PKA activation in rat b-cells . The activity of PKA , a downstream effector of cAMP elevations , was measured in rat single b-cells using PKA-sensitive DR-II fluorescence with confocal microscopy . DR-II fluorescence is inversely related to PKA activity 21 . Fluorescence intensity decreased by only 2 % during scanning for 30 min , indicating that photo bleaching of DR-II signal was negligible in this experimental condition data not shown . A rise in the perfusate glucose concentration from 2.8 to 8.3 mmol L decreased DR-II fluorescence , as shown by an increase in F0-to-F ratio reflecting an increase in PKA activity in rat single b-cells Fig. 3G . The glucose 8.3 mmol L -induced increase in the PKA activity was significantly inhibited by treatment with ghrelin in the majority of b-cells examined Fig. 3H and I . Ghrelin activates Kv channels via PKA-dependent signaling pathway but does not alter L-type Ca2+ channels in b-cells . The Kv channel currents in rat b-cells under nystatin-perforated whole-cell clamp were measured in the presence of 100 mmol L tolbutamide to inhibit the ATP-sensitive K+ KATP channel and thereby exclude involvement of this channel in the currents . In the presence of 8.3 mmol L glucose , outward K+ currents evoked by depolarizing pulses from a holding potential of 270 to 20 mV were increased by exposure to 10 nmol L ghrelin Fig. 4A , confirming previous reports 5,15 . The current-voltage relationships demonstrated that ghrelin sig-nificantly increased the current densities through Kv chan-nels at potentials positive to 230 mV Fig. 4B . At a holding potential of 20 mV , ghrelin significantly increased the cur-rent densities to 125.8 6 12.6 pA pF from 103.2 6 9.1 pA pF P , 0.05 , n 8 Fig. 4D . In the presence of 6-Phe-cAMP 10 mmol L , the Kv channel currents evoked by depolariz-ing pulse to 20 mV were not increased by ghrelin Fig. 4A and ghrelin failed to enhance the current densities in the entire range of potentials Fig. 4C and D . The Kv channel currents in the 6-Phe-cAMP-treated cells tended to decrease compared with control currents in nontreated cells Fig. 4B and C , though the difference was not statistically significant Fig. 4D . We next examined the effect of 6-Phe-cAMP by itself on the b-cells . A constant depolarizing pulse from 270 to 20 mV every 20 s evoked Kv currents in the external solution containing 5.6 mmol L glucose Fig. 4E . The cur-rents markedly decreased upon exposure to 6-Phe-cAMP 10 mmol L and recovered by washout of it Fig . 4E and F . In control experiments without the PKA activator , Kv cur-rents were kept constant for .15 min data not shown . The effect of ghrelin on the voltage-dependent Ca2+ chan-nel was determined in rat single b-cells . In the control ex-ternal solution containing 8.3 mmol L glucose , a depolarizing pulse from holding potential of 270 to 0 mV evoked a long-lasting inward current in rat b-cells Fig. 4G , and this current was markedly inhibited by an L-type Ca2+ channel blocker , nifedipine 10 mmol L data not shown . Exposure of cells to ghrelin 10 nmol L did not alter the current amplitude or current-voltage relationships Fig. 4G and H , indicating that ghrelin does not directly affect L-type Ca2+ channels in b-cells . Ghrelin attenuates glucose-induced [ Ca2+ ] i increases in b-cells in a PKA pathway-dependent manner . A re - petitive glucose 8.3 mmol L stimulation induced repeated [ Ca2+ ] i increases in rat single b-cells . The ratio of the peak [ Ca2+ ] i response to the second glucose stimulation S2 to that to the first stimulation S1 , S2 S1 , was 0.77 6 0.04 n 93 in the control cells . Ghrelin 10 nmol L , added to perfused solution 5 min prior to the second glucose stimulation , suppressed [ Ca2+ ] i responses , de-creasing S2-to-S1 ratio to 0.57 6 0.04 P , 0.01 , n 91 Fig. 5A and G . The effect of ghrelin on [ Ca2+ ] i responses was abolished by treatment with db-cAMP 1 mmol L Fig. 5B and G and 6-Phe-cAMP 10 mmol L Fig. 5C and G . These cAMP analogs alone potentiated the glucose-induced [ Ca2+ ] i responses in b-cells , resulting in increases in S2-to-S1 ratio Fig. 5G . Pretreatment of cells with MDL-12330A 10 mmol L significantly suppressed the glucose-induced [ Ca2+ ] i increases Fig. 5D and G , sug-gesting that activation of adenylate cyclase is involved in the glucose-induced [ Ca2+ ] i increases in b-cells . In MDL-12330A-treated cells , ghrelin did not attenuate [ Ca2+ ] i responses to glucose Fig. 5G . The inhibitory effect of ghrelin on [ Ca2+ ] i responses was unaltered in the presence of Epac activator 8-pCPT-29-O-Me-cAMP at 30 mmol L Fig. 5E and G or phospholipase-C inhibitor U-73122 1 mmol L Fig. 5F and G . Neither 8-pCPT-29-O-Me-cAMP 30 mmol L nor U-73122 1 mmol L by itself had effect on [ Ca2+ ] i . These results suggest that ghrelin acts on the cAMP signaling route linked primarily to PKA but not Epac and thereby suppresses the glucose-induced [ Ca2+ ] i increases in b-cells . DISCUSSION In this study , we have demonstrated that ghrelin sup-presses glucose-induced insulin secretion from pancre-atic islets in a cAMP-dependent manner . Moreover , ghrelin decreases cAMP levels in islets and b-cells , and the de-creased cAMP mediates the electrical and [ Ca2+ ] i respon-ses to ghrelin . In rat perfused pancreas and isolated islets , the insuli-nostatic ability of ghrelin was blunted when cellular cAMP level was clamped upward with a cAMP analog and downward with an adenylate cyclase inhibitor . The ade-nylate cyclase inhibitor itself mimicked the insulinostatic ghrelin action . Ghrelin , moreover , reduced the glucose-induced cAMP production in isolated islets , whereas blockade of endogenous ghrelin with a ghrelin receptor antagonist and an antiserum enhanced it . Since cAMP was measured in the presence of PDE inhibitor , it is likely that ghrelin affects cAMP levels primarily via interacting with the step of cAMP synthesis rather than degradation . Fur-thermore , evanescent-wave microscopy and two-photon confocal microscopy demonstrated that ghrelin directly interacts with MIN6 and rat b-cells to decrease glucose-induced increases in [ cAMP ] i and [ PKA ] i . In pancreatic b-cells , Kv channels repolarize cells and attenuate glucose-stimulated action potentials , limiting Ca2+ entry through voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels to suppress insulin secretion 22 . We previously reported that ghrelin activates Kv channels via PTX-sensitive mechanisms to cause rapid repolarization and shortening of bursting action potentials , thereby attenuating glucose-induced [ Ca2+ ] i increases and insulin secretion 15 . In the current study , we found that the action of ghrelin to suppress glucose-induced [ Ca2+ ] i increases was blunted in the b-cells whose cAMP levels were clamped upward by a cAMP analog and downward by an adenylate cyclase inhibitor Fig. 5 . It is known that cAMP potentiates insulin secretion by both PKA-dependent and Epac-dependent mechanisms . 6-Phe-cAMP is a selective activator of PKA 23 , and 8-pCPT-29-O-Me-cAMP relatively activates Epac with high affinity 24 . Ghrelin failed to suppress glucose-induced [ Ca2+ ] i increases in b-cells and insulin release in isolated islets in the presence of 6-Phe-cAMP 10 mmol L , whereas 8-pCPT-29-O-Me-cAMP 30 mmol L did not alter the effect of ghrelin on [ Ca2+ ] i in b-cells . In consideration of the reports that higher concentrations of cAMP are required for activating Epac pathway 25–27 , it is likely that the glucose-induced elevation of cAMP to a moderate level in b-cells is capable of activating PKA but not Epac . Ghrelin , therefore , may at-tenuate [ Ca2+ ] i increases in b-cells at least partly by counter-acting the glucose-stimulated cAMP and PKA signaling . However , our data with cAMP analogs can not exclude an additional involvement of Epac in the ghrelin signaling be-cause Epac activator used in the current study reportedly potentiates glucose-induced insulin release in a PKA -- dependent manner 28 . Furthermore , potentiation of the b-cell Kv channel currents by ghrelin was blunted when PKA activity was clamped at high levels with a 6-Phe-cAMP . The PKA activator itself inhibited the channel currents Fig. 4E . These data suggest that ghrelin activates Kv channels by counteracting the cAMP-PKA signaling . In agreement with this finding , it has been shown that incretin hormones GLP-1 , glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide , and pitui-tary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide promote cAMP generation in pancreatic b-cells to potentiate insulin secretion 29–31 and that GLP-1 receptor agonist exendin-4 suppresses Kv channel currents in rat b-cells via PKA-dependent and Epac-independent mechanisms 32 . Possible additional inhibitory action of ghrelin on the cAMP-dependent exocytotic machinery remains to be established . It was reported that several hormone receptors of the G-protein Gi -family regulate the KATP channel activity and o insulin exocytosis 33–35 . Whether the ghrelin action could also involve these processes remains to be studied . We found that ghrelin selectively attenuated glucose-induced insulin release without altering ACh-induced in-sulin release at 2.8 mmol L glucose in the perfused rat pancreas . In an apparent discrepancy , ghrelin is reported to suppress carbachol-induced insulin secretion at 5.5 mmol L glucose , a concentration over the threshold for insulin release , in the perfused rat pancreas 36 . ACh stimulates b-cells exclusively via muscarinic M3 receptor 37,38 and induces [ Ca2+ ] i increases and insulin secretion in a glucose-dependent manner 39,40 . Collectively , it is likely that ghrelin suppresses M3 receptor-mediated glucose-dependent insulin release by interfering with glu-cose signaling but not with muscarinic receptor signaling . It has been reported that GHS-R is coupled to G11-phospholipase C signaling , leading to production of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate IP3 and Ca2+ release from IP3-sensitive stores 2 , and that ghrelin activates phospholipase-C pathway for stimulating growth hormone release in pituitary cells 41,42 . In contrast , the mecha-nisms by which GHS-R activates PTX-sensitive Gi-proteins and decreases cAMP in b-cells are unclear . PTX-sensitive ghrelin signaling is reported in the guinea pig femoral artery smooth muscle cells 43 . G-protein–coupled receptors often activate more than one type of G-protein 44 . Hence , the ghrelin interaction with GHS-R could activate distinct classes of G-protein signaling including G11-and Gi-mediated pathways in a tissue-specific manner . Alternatively , the isoforms of GHS-R 45,46 or heterodimer of GHS-R with other receptors 47 could access the Gi-protein complex . The ghrelin receptor in b-cells remains to be further characterized . In conclusion , ghrelin attenuates the glucose-induced cAMP production and PKA activation , which drives acti-vation of Kv channels and suppression of the glucose-induced [ Ca2+ ] i increase and insulin release . This is a novel ghrelin signaling that operates in islet b-cells , being dis-tinct from that reported in other tissues including pituitary growth hormone cells . It has been shown that ghrelin re-ceptor antagonists and GOAT inhibitor increase the insulin release and decrease blood glucose in glucose tolerance tests , thereby acting as antidiabetic 5,12,15,48–50 . The current study demonstrated that the ghrelin’s signaling cascade and consequent inhibition of insulin release are mediated by attenuation of the cAMP pathway . Hence , counteracting the attenuation of cAMP could provide a new strategy to counteract insulinostatic ghrelin action and thereby to treat type 2 diabetes .

21798334	a r t i c l e Article history Section Editor T.E . Johnson Keywords FET3 1 . Introduction Both theory and experimental evidence support the premise that mitochondria are central to the aging process Balaban et al. , 2005 Wallace , 2005 . Energy production in mitochondria is dependent on the efficient transfer of electrons between the complexes of the electron transport chain . Efficient transfer of electrons between complexes depends on the presence of iron and copper as cofactors iron in complex I , III , IV , coenzyme Q and cytochrome C , and copper in complex IV . Iron deficiency can lead to the loss of heme synthesis , a specific decrease in of complex IV levels , and an increase in oxidative damage Atamna et al. , 2002 . To utilize the budding yeast , Saccharomyces cerevisiae , as a tool to investigate the role of mitochondria in cellular aging we have altered the standard replicative life span assay , replacing glucose with glycerol as the carbon source , forcing the yeast cells to respire . We have used this system to analyze the effect of iron supplementation on yeast longevity . Though iron is essential , in excess it can be toxic to cells , hence iron uptake into the cell is stringently regulated . Iron is abundant in the environment , but mostly as ferric hydroxide which is not very soluble ? Corresponding author . Tel . +1 561 799 8676 . E-mail addresses Gabriela.Botta @ biomet.com G. Botta , cturn @ fau.edu C.S. Turn , nquintyn @ fau.edu N.J . Quintyne , pkirchma @ fau.edu P.A. Kirchman . Yun et al. , 2000 . Mechanisms that S. cerevisiae use to obtain and regulate iron are well described Philpott and Protchenko , 2008 . Yeast have several mechanisms for iron uptake , all of which are under the control of Aft1p , which is the major iron dependent transcription factor in yeast Yamaguchi-Iwai et al. , 1996 . Ferric iron in growth media is first reduced by one of two plasma membrane metalloreductases Fre1p or Fre2p Dancis et al. , 1990 Georgatsou and Alexandraki , 1994 . Uptake through the plasma membrane occurs through either a high affinity system that utilizes a multicopper oxidase , Fet3p , and permease Ftr1p Stearman et al. , 1996 , or a low affinity system that utilizes the permease , Fet4p Dix et al. , 1997 . Another mechanism yeast can use to accumulate iron is through the capture of siderophores . Siderophores are secreted molecules that can specifically bind ferric iron with high affinity Wandersman and Delepelaire , 2004 . The iron that is bound to these siderophores can be captured by specific cellular transport systems in yeast . Yeast are not capable of secreting their own siderophores but are able to obtain siderophore bound iron though the use of the Arn and Fit families of polypeptides which recognize and bind different siderophores Philpott et al. , 2002 . High affinity uptake of iron by yeast requires copper as a cofactor for Fet3p . We have previously shown that copper supplementation increases replicative life span of yeast grown on media requiring respiratory metabolism Kirchman and Botta , 2007 . We now show that copper s influence on life span is through its involvement in iron import by Fet3p Ftr1p . 2 . Materials and methods 2.1 .

For life span or iron analyses , when indicated , ferric chloride was added to a final concentration of 1 mM and copper sulfate was added to a final concentration of 62 ? M . When required , media was acidified by the addition of 1 M HCl to pH 6.2 . 2.2 . Life span analysis Life span analyses were conducted as described previously Kirchman et al. , 1999 . In short , 1 ? l of logarithmically growing cells from YPG liquid media was placed onto YPG plates . The unbudded cells were further separated from the cellular population with the use of a micromanipu-lator . These cells were allowed to grow and produce buds . These buds wereremovedandusedasthecohortforlifespananalysis.Theremovalof an individual bud from a cell was counted as a generation . The cells were grown at 30 °C during the day and at 12.5 °C overnight . It has beenshown that cells grown at low temperatures are not affected in their overall life span Muller et al. , 1980 . All life span data presented are representative examples of life span analyses , which were all repeated a minimum of 3 times . Statistical analyses of individual life span experiments were performed using the nonparametric Mann–Whitney test . 2.3 . Iron assay BY4742 was grown in 250 ml YPG at 30 °C shaking at 220 RPM . For growth under iron supplementation conditions , iron was added to a concentration of 200 ? M for 30 min before increasing the concentra-tion to 1 mM for growth . Cultures were started at an OD600 of less than 0.5 and cells were harvested in mid to late log phase when the OD600 reached between 4.5 and 5.2 by centrifugation at 1000 ? g . Cell pellets were washed three times with nanopure water and then the slurries were transferred to pre-weighed porcelain crucibles . Cell pellets were dried for 30 min at 80 °C in a vacuum oven and then weighed to determine the dry pellet weight . Samples were ashed in a muffle furnace at 550 °C for N16 h and then weighted to determine the ash weight . To assay iron , the following procedure adapted from Atkins , 1975 was used . Three hundred microliters of nanopure water were used to wet the ash , which was then dissolved by adding 600 ? l of 6 M HCl and heating . Samples were then brought to 1.2 ml by the addition of nanopure water and the pH was adjusted to approximately 3.5 by the addition of between 350 and 400 ? l 10 M NaOH . Samples were divided into 3 tubes and the iron was reduced by the addition of 100 ? l of 10 mg ml hydroquinone . As a blank 150 ? l of water was added to one of the 3 samples . To the other 2 samples 150 ? l of o-phenanthro-line was added , prepared by dissolving 1.25 g in 50 mL of ethanol and adding 450 mL of water . After more than 1 h absorbance was measured at 508 nM . Iron concentration per microgram of ash was normalized to the iron concentration of ash from cells grown in unsupplemented YPG . Statistical analyses of the differences in iron content were conducted using a one-tailed paired t-test . Standard curves were prepared from a stock of 8 mM Fe NH4 SO4 •6H2O pH 2 2 3.5 . 2.4 .

Results 3.1 . Life span extension by copper requires FET3 Wepreviouslydeterminedthatcopper sinfluenceonyeastlongevity was not through the copper containing enzyme Cu Zn SOD Kirchman and Botta , 2007 . This led us to hypothesize that copper was acting indirectly to influence longevity . Fet3p is a plasma membrane ferroxidase that requires four copper ions for activity and is required for high affinity iron import . In order to explore the relationship between this system and increased life span , we examined the life span of a fet3 mutant grown with and without copper supplementation . Copper supplementation extends life span between 45 and 60 % in multiple repeats of the experiment , but this extension is lost in a fet3 strain . Although the fet3 mutant displayed slower growth both in liquid and solid media , as has been described for this mutant on respiratory media Yuan etal. , 1995 , itdid not havea shortened lifespancompared to the BY4742 control . Fig. 1 , a representative experiment , clearly shows the life span extension due to copper supplementation and its loss in a fet3 strain . 3.2 . Supplementation with iron also extends life span If the extension of life span by copper supplementation is due to an increase in iron importation by Fet3p , then a similar result might also be obtained if Fet3p were induced to higher activity by another means . While increased iron does result in approximately 3 fold lower levels of Fet3p Felice et al. , 2005 we hypothesized that , if iron concentration is the rate limiting step , then the higher extracellular concentration might drive import into the cell through the remaining Fet3p . Ferric chloride was added to YPG media to a final concentration of 1 mM , which is greater than a 50 fold increase over what we found in unsupplemented YPG media . While much of this iron is expected to precipitate , much is also expected to complex with organic material in the medium Theis and Singer , 1974 and life span analyses suggest that the increased concentration does result in increased iron available to the cells . Life span analyses show that iron supplementation does reproducibly extend the life span of the control strain BY4742 between 35 and 50 % , but the fet3 strain does not show a significant increase in life span a representative experiment is shown in Fig. 2 . The addition of FeCl3 lowers the pH of the media from 6.8 to 6.2 . We assessed the effect of acidification on life span and found no extension due to decreased pH not shown . Thus , the extension is entirely dependent on FET3 . 3.3 . Copper or iron extend life span through the same pathway Supplementation of solid YPG media with 62 ? M copper or 1 mM iron each increased life span compared to controls with no metal supplementation . Each of these effects require FET3 , implying that copper s influence on life span is solely due to increased iron import . To confirm that copper and iron operate in the same pathway , through FET3 , life span analyses were performed on media supplemented with each metal individually and both metals simultaneously . Media with either metal or both metals increases longevity , but copper and iron combined did not have additive effects on life span extension beyond either metal alone . An example of one experiment is shown in Fig. 3 . Fig. 4 . Iron supplementation does not increase replicative life span under conditions allowing fermentation . The mean life span of BY4742 on YPD media ? was 21.4 and on YPD supplemented with 1 mM iron ? was 22.2 p 0.64 . 3.4 . Life span extension by iron requires respiratory growth We have previously shown that the extension of life span by copper supplementation only occurs on media requiring respiratory growth Kirchman and Botta , 2007 . Since copper supplementation extends life span by providing increased iron import through Fet3p , life span extension by iron supplementation should also be limited to respiratory growth . This turned out to be the case , as BY4742 grown on YPD media , containing glucose instead of glycerol , showed no increase in life span when grown on YPD supplemented with iron . An example of one such experiment is shown in Fig. 4 . 3.5 . Supplementation with iron or copper results in increased cell associated iron To confirm that iron supplementation resulted in an increase in iron associated with cells , we measured the iron present in cells grown with and without supplementation . Cell pellets were ashed and a colorimet-ricassaywasusedtodeterminetheironcontentof theash.Theresults of the assay are shown in Fig. 5 . The iron found in the pellet of cells grown with iron supplementation was 1.8 fold average of 2 trials more than what was found in cells grown in unsupplemented YPG . Because we were concerned that the iron could simply be associated with the surface of the cells due to the high concentration in the media , we also tested the iron content in cell grown in media supplemented with copper.Ifcoppersupplementationdoes increase theimport of iron , then iron levels should also be higher in copper supplemented cells . We found that the iron concentration was increased 1.4 fold average of 3 trials in the pellet of cells grown with copper supplementation Fig. 5 . 3.6 . Iron partially rescues the life span of SOD mutants Iron deficiency can lead to oxidative stress Ames et al. , 2005 . To examine the possibility that the increased iron reduces oxidative stress to extend life span we analyzed the effect of iron supplementation on the life spans of SOD1 Cu Zn SOD and SOD2 Mn SOD mutants . Previous research has shown that copper supplementation partially restores life span in these mutants Kirchman and Botta , 2007 . If copper s effect was in fact due to increased iron uptake by the cells , then iron supplementation should have similar results . Both SOD mutants were assayed on YPG media with and without iron supplementation . Supplementation with iron reproducibly increases the life span of the sod1 strain , and almost completely restores the life span of the sod2 strain to the level of the unsupplemented BY4742 control Fig. 6 . These results do not exactly mimic the result of our previous findings with copper , since iron supplementation does not rescue the sod1 mutant as well as copper supplementation . However , the extension of life span in both the sod1 and sod2 strains with either iron or copper is significant and suggests that the increased iron in cells grown with iron or copper supplementation decreases oxidative stress . 3.7 . Cells grown with copper supplementation show lower levels of superoxide production To determine if the higher cellular iron concentrations resulted in lower oxidative stress , cells were stained with dihydroethidium DHE and analyzed for fluorescence by flow cytometry . When DHE reacts with superoxide , ethidium is formed and can be detected by fluorescent emission . Cells grow with or without copper supplemen-tation were stained and analyzed as shown in Fig. 7 . A gate was generated that excluded unstained cells . Cells stained with DHE were then assayed for fluorescence and the percentage of cells with fluorescent intensity above the unstained control was determined . Twenty five thousand cells grown with or without copper supple-mentation were analyzed for the BY4742 , sod1 , and sod2 strains . The percentage of fluorescent cells above the threshold decreased significantly when cells were grown with copper supplementation in each of the three strains , indicating that superoxide production is decreased in cells grown with copper supplementation Fig. 8 . 4 . Discussion Thecoppercontainingferroxidase , Fet3p , hasbeenshowntoincrease iron concentrations in yeast Stearman et al. , 1996 . The life span of fet3 mutants is not increased by either copper or iron supplementation , showing both that the extension by copper is due to the increase in iron supplied to the cell through Fet3p , and that life span extension by iron is dependent on Fet3p for entry into the cell . Even at high iron concentrations the iron responsible for life span extension is entering cells through the high affinity transporter Fet3p . While iron is still required , the low affinity transporter , Fet4p , is sufficient to provide iron for survival . Fet4p is a low affinity transporter and the amount of iron it imports does not change much over a range of iron concentrations Dix et al. , 1997 . In fact , Fet4p transport of iron is less than optimal even for growth since the fet3 strain displays a growth defect on non-fermentable carbon sources Yuan et al. , 1995 and our unpublished observation . The extension of life span in cells supplied with iron or copper is possibly due to a reduction in oxidative stress , which is supported by our findings that strains with deletions of either SOD1 or SOD2 have greatly reduced life spans that are partially rescued by iron supplementation Fig. 6 , and that copper supplemented cells have reduced production of superoxide Fig. 8 . We did not directly measure superoxide production in cells supplemented with iron because the precipitate caused by the high iron concentration titrates out the DHE , resulting in poor staining . To remove this precipitate for the iron assay required extensive washing , which would likely result in metabolically inactive cells . Since copper supplementation in-creases cellular iron the decrease in superoxide production is likely due to the increased iron in cells . Initially the idea that increasing iron concentration extends life span seems counter-intuitive due to the possibility of superoxide production by the often referenced Fenton reaction . Disorders that result in high levels of iron , such as hemochromatosis Toyokuni , 2009 , or Friedreich s ataxia Armstrong et al. , 2010 show increased oxidative stress due to the Fenton reaction , in which ferrous iron Fe2+ catalytically generates hydoroxyl radicals Wardman and Candeias , 1996 . However , evidence for the existence of free ferrous iron in non-diseased eukaryotic cells or organisms is rare due to a lack of methods to detect it Pate et al. , 2006 Toyokuni , 2009 . Anemia on the other hand is a confirmed problem in elderly humans Vanasse and Berliner , 2010 . Therefore , the more realistic danger in normal aging may be a lack of iron that results in the inhibition of an efficient electron flow . A variety of situations that inhibit electron transfer through the electron transport chain , such asdisease Espositoet al. , 1999 Calabrese et al. , 2005 Napoli et al. , 2006 or chemical inhibitors St-Pierre et al. , 2002 are known to increase mitochondrial production of reactive oxygenspecies ROS .Yeastcellsinwhichelectrontransportisinhibited either chemically , or through mutation or loss of mitochondrial DNA display an increase in nuclear mutations due to increased ROS production Rasmussen et al. , 2003 . Iron deficiency , in the form of anemia in humans , has been shown to reduce heme content in mitochondrial and lead to the increase in ROS Atamna et al. , 2002 Ames et al. , 2005 . This may be the finding most similar to the results presented here . The yeast strains were grown on rich media containing yeast extract . Even without supplementation the iron concentration is far from limiting for growth , as colonies have no problem growing in these conditions and supplemented liquid cultures grow at the same rate as unsupplemented not shown . However , the life span assay looks not for survival of the colony , but for survival of the individual . In order to produce exponential growth each cell only needs to bud twice . For maximal life span the iron requirements are higher than they are for basic survival , which is likely true for a variety of nutrients in all organisms given the opportunity to reach maximum longevity Ames et al. , 2005 . The reduced ability of cells to obtain and or incorporate iron into the components of the electron transport chain could , in part , account for increased oxidative stress and damage found in tissue with increasing age Moghaddas et al. , 2003 Choksi et al. , 2008 . Lam et al. 2011 have recently shown that oxidative stress begins to accumulate early in replicatively aging yeast . Even slightly increased levels of ROS at earlier ages due to less efficient electron transport could result in a shortening of replicative life span . It has been known for some time that increased respiration leads to increased longevity in yeast . Lin et al. 2002 showed that the shift in metabolism toward respiration is responsible for the increased replicative life span of yeast grown under conditions that mimic caloric restriction in yeast 0.5 % glucose vs. the normal 2 % glucose . Although copper or iron supplementation does not increase the life span of glucose grown yeast , we have preliminary evidence that copper or iron supplementation does increase the replicative life span of yeast grown on raffinose , although not to the same extent as on glycerol not shown . This is likely due to the fact that on raffinose mitochondrial biogenesis is not repressed to the same extent as it is on glucose , resulting in increased respiratory metabolism Szekely and Montgomery , 1984 . Further support comes from Barros et al. 2004 who found that that increasing respiration by lowering glucose concentration or adding an uncoupling agent increases yeast chronological life span and lowers the production of ROS . Veatch et al. 2009 have shown that older yeast cells N20 generations produce buds that have lost heterozygosity LOH . They propose that decreased iron–sulfur cluster ISC biogenesis results from the loss of mitochondrial DNA and alters the iron regulon in cells , leading to LOH . In our system , with haploid cells grown on a non-fermentable carbon source , the loss of either nuclear or mitochondrial chromosomes will result in cell death . Their system uses diploid cells grown on a fermentable carbon source , allowing viability and detection of both cells that have lost mitochondrial DNA or cells that have lost chromosomes . What initially causes the loss of mitochondrial DNA is an open question . Iron–sulfur clusters are known to be targets of ROS damage Sideri et al. , 2009 and , when damaged can release free iron , leading to DNA damage Keyer and Imlay , 1996 . A protein containing an iron–sulfur cluster , which is also known to be involved in mitochondrial DNA maintenance , is mitochondrial aconitase Chen et al. , 2005 . This role is independent of its catalytic activity in the Krebs cycle . Mitochondrial aconitase is part of a mitochondrial nucleoid that protects mitochondrial DNA from oxidative damage Chen et al. , 2007 and is regulated by the retrograde response Liu and Butow , 2006 , which coordinates metabolism and aging Jazwinski , 2005 . Interestingly , mitochondrial aconitase has recently been shown to be asymmetrically inherited in yeast , with the oxidatively-damaged , inactive molecules remaining in the mother cell Klinger et al. , 2010 . If increased iron counteracts the initial decrease in iron–sulfur cluster or heme production , thereby reducing oxidative stress , it would lead to the extension of life span seen in our system by decreasing the rate of damage to mitochondrial aconitase and mitochondrial DNA . These mechanisms clearly fit into the free radical theory of aging Harman , 1973 and the various “vicious cycle” theories that follow Alexeyev et al. , 2004 . Iron regulation and utilization is clearly a complex process . The S. cerevisiae genome database www.yeastgenome.org lists 75 genes involved with iron . We are currently looking for the point at which iron supplementation influences life span . While it appears from our data that iron supplementation may act in the mitochondrion to reduce oxidative stress , the effect may be complex . The analysis is made more difficult by the fact that many of the genes involved cause respiratory deficiency and are therefore not assayable in our system . While this does present a problem , we continue to believe that analyses on media requiring yeast to respire will lead to new insights in cellular longevity , which is demonstrated by the fact that neither copper nor iron supplementation have any effect on life span when yeast cells are allowed to ferment .

CGRP adrenomedullin receptors , in order to be active , require the obligatory association of the calcitonin-like receptor CLR with the Receptor Activity-Modifying Proteins 1–3 RAMP1–3 McLatchie et al. , 1998 . It is the association with the different members of the RAMP family that confers the specificity of these receptors to bind the various peptides of the family Born et al. , 2002 Christopoulos et al. , 1999 CLR RAMP1 complex forms the CGRP receptor antagonized by the CGRP antagonist CGRP8–37 , while CLR assembly with RAMP2 and RAMP3 gives rise to the adrenomedullin receptors 1 and 2 , respectively Poyner et al. , 2002 . The interaction of these receptor complexes with an additional cytoplasmic protein , the Receptor Component Protein RCP is required for the activation of signal transduction cascades , including cyclic adenosine monophosphate cAMP formation Evans et al. , 2000 Luebke et al. , 1996 . CGRP adrenomedullin receptors are widespread in endothelial , vascular smooth muscle , immune , glial and neuronal cells Hay et al. , 2004 . One of the most studied and potent physiological effects elicited by CGRP adrenomedullin receptor activation is vasodilation Brain and Grant , 2004 . In the brain , the potent and long-lasting activity of CGRP on arteries and veins Brain and Grant , 2004 modulates local blood flow and extravasation , and is thought to be involved in headache Geppetti et al. , 2005 . Also adrenomedullin , which is produced by endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells , has been proposed to play a role in the regulation of systemic blood pressure . In particular , adrenomedullin inhibits endothelial cell contraction and junctional disassembly , thereby limiting vascular permeability and edema during inflammation Temmesfeld-Wollbrück et al. , 2007 . Among the various effects of CGRP and adrenomedullin , their ability to modulate the immune neural-immune system is of utmost interest and the emerging picture indicates that the two peptides can exert pro-as well as anti-inflammatory actions in a cell tissue-specific and stimulus-specific manner . For instance , experiments on animal models demonstrate anti-inflammatory effects of CGRP Gomes et al. , 2005 Kroeger et al. , 2009 Tsujikawa et al. , 2007 that set against the neurogenic inflammatory action widely reported in periphery and brain Durham and Vause , 2010 Holzer , 1998 . Similarly , both pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory roles have been proposed for adrenomedullin see , for instance , Dackor and Caron , 2007 Ma et al. , 2010 Miksa et al. , 2007 although very little is known about its activity in the central nervous system . Based on these assumptions , CGRP and adrenomedullin are expected to be involved in several neuroinflammatory conditions and to play an important role in some neurodegenerative processes . For instance , the inflammatory compo-nent of multiple sclerosis is characterized by a complex interplay of cells resident microglia , astrocytes , infiltrating macrophages and T cells , mediated by released molecules , such as tumor necrosis factor ? TNF ? , interleukin-6 IL6 and nitric oxide NO , that can exert a detrimental role on neuronal function see e.g . Encinas et al. , 2005 Hartung et al. , 1995 Martino et al. , 2000 . Moreover , chemokines released by vascular and perivascular resident glial cells are known to favor infiltration of lymphocytes into the parenchyma of the central nervous system , an obligatory step for the progression of the autoimmune attack Engelhardt and Ransohoff , 2005 Szczucinski and Losy , 2007 . In this work we investigate the effects of CGRP and adrenome-dullin in glial cultures , showing that CGRP and adrenomedullin exert a potent and efficient anti-inflammatory role on microglia activation by inhibiting the lipopolysaccharide LPS -induced release of pro-inflammatory molecules . This previously unrecognized role of CGRP and adrenomedullin on glial cells might be relevant in the neurodegenerative processes by inhibiting the inflammatory process and stimulating repair events . It follows that these findings may represent a new paradigm to devise therapeutic strategies for neuroinflammatory diseases , such as multiple sclerosis . Results CGRP and adrenomedullin inhibit LPS-induced glia activation In order to evaluate the effects of CGRP and adrenomedullin on glia activation , we first established the conditions to stimulate microglia and astrocytes in culture . Cultures of either pure astrocytes or microglia seeded on a layer of pure astrocytes co-culture ratio 1 1 see Experimental methods were exposed to various treatments . As expected from previous data , pure astrocytes were unresponsive to 24 h exposure to 10 ng ml LPS Saura , 2007 see also Fig. 5 . In contrast , when co-cultures were exposed to the same protocol of stimulation , a marked increase in IL6 secretion , TNF ? release , NO production and iNOS induction was observed Fig. 1 . These data confirm that LPS is able to promote the expression and secretion of the major glial activation markers by directly acting on microglia that may in turn recruit astrocytes in the activation process . When LPS was applied to co-cultures in the presence of CGRP or adrenomedullin , a dose-dependent inhibition of activation was observed Figs . 1A–F . CGRP and adrenomedullin had no effects on unstimulated cells either microglia astrocyte co-cultures or pure astrocytes not shown . The immunofluorescences in Fig. 2 show the astrocyte microglia ratio in a typical experiment Fig. 2A as well as the strong iNOS up-regulation induced by LPS challenge in most microglial cells , but not in astrocytes Figs . 2B and C . We then used CGRP8-37 and AM22-52 , two antagonists of the CGRP and adrenomedullin receptors , respectively , in order to verify the pharmacological profile of the neuropeptide effects . The two antagonists reduced the inhibitory action of CGRP and adrenome-dullin on LPS-treated cultures , as revealed by the effects on IL6 secretion , TNF ? release and NO production Fig. 3 . This result is in line with the notion that astrocytes are potentially able to form all the receptors for CGRP and adrenomedullin Moreno et al. , 2002 , but also reveals a different extent of inhibition exerted by the two antagonists . On the one hand this could reflect the ligand–receptor promiscuity of this system in which CGRP may also act on the adrenomedullin receptor 2 and adrenomedullin can also activate the CGRP receptor Poyner et al. , 2002 . On the other hand , it must be considered that AM22-52 acts with different potencies on the two adrenomedullin receptors Hay et al. , 2004 . To verify whether the results obtained in the co-cultures were influenced by the interplay between the two cell types , we performed experiments on highly-enriched microglia cultures ~95 % purity . LPS was able to increase the three markers of activation Fig. 4 although with a different pattern of release . In fact , in microglia cultures the ratio between TNF ? and IL6 was reduced about 3–4 folds with respect to co-cultures suggesting that astrocytes can significantly contribute to the release of some cytokines . Also in this experimental cellular model CGRP and adrenomedullin exerted an inhibitory effect on the induction of LPS activation Fig. 4 . CGRP and adrenomedullin do not inhibit glia activation promoted by cytokine administration Since also pro-inflammatory cytokines have been reported to cause glia activation , we evaluated the effects of the two neuropep-tides upon exposure of cells to a mix of cytokines IL1 ? , TNF ? , and INF ? . In all cell cultures microglia astrocytes , pure astrocytes and highly-enriched microglia CGRP treatment did not exert inhibitory effects on NO iNOS and IL6 levels Fig. 5 , thus suggesting that , under this condition , the activation process is sustained by different mechanisms and that CGRP modulates only specific pathways leading to cytokine and NO release from microglia . Similar results were obtained with adrenomedullin see Figs. 5E and F for the effects on microglia . Role of cAMP and cAMP-related stimuli in the modulation of microglia activation In view of the fact that CGRP and adrenomedullin are known to activate adenylyl cyclase and promote cAMP increase , we exposed cells to various treatments able to stimulate or mimic the cAMP pathway Fig. 6 . Isoproterenol , which is reported to activate ? -adrenergic receptors on microglia Tanaka et al. , 2002 , displayed the same effect of CGRP and adrenomedullin , while other , non receptor-mediated pro-tocols to elevate cAMP , had a more complex behavior . In fact , treatment with either 8-Br-cAMP , an analog of cAMP , or forskolin , an activator of adenylyl cyclase , prevented the LPS-induced increase in IL6 production and TNF ? release , but not NO elevation Figs . 6A–C . Hence , receptor stimulation elicits effects that go beyond a simple cAMP increase . Indeed , another stimulus commonly used to raise cAMP in microglia , PGE2 , was effective in reducing LPS-mediated IL6 and TNF ? release , but was not able to produce the same inhibitory effect on NO production Figs . 6D–F . Rather , PGE2 reinforced the LPS-mediated NO increase , most likely by stimulation of the prostaglandin E receptor 2 EP2 , as revealed by the similar effects obtained with butaprost specific agonist for EP2 , but not sulprostone specific agonist for EP3 . In light of the possibility that CGRP and adrenomedullin mat activate signaling pathways other than cAMP Wang et al. , 2009 we exposed LPS-activated cultures to PD98059 50 ? M and SB203580 10 ? M , two specific inhibitors of the pathways linked to activation of mitogen activated protein kinases MAPK . These drugs showed a strong inhibitory effect on LPS-induced microglia activation , but did not influence the effects of CGRP and adrenomedullin data not shown . Inhibition of chemokine expression by CGRP and adrenomedullin Having established thatCGRP and adrenomedullin reducemicroglial activation , we tested whether these same treatments were also able to affect chemokine production in LPS-stimulated co-cultures . Indeed , the transcription of some chemokines known to play a major role in neuroinflammation e.g . CCL2 MCP1 , CCL3 MIP1 ? , CXCL10 IP10 and IL10 was promoted by LPS Fig. 7 . Of note , CGRP and adrenomedullin differentially affected these increases CCL2 MCP1 and CCL3 MIP1 ? inductionwasstronglyrepressed bybothneuropeptides , whileCXCL10 IP10 increase was not significantly inhibited . On the other hand , the expression of IL10 , which is potentiated in alternative pathways of microglia activation , was not increased by the two neuropeptides and even lowered by adrenomedullin Fig. 7D . CGRP and adrenomedullin werealso ineffectiveininducinggenes related to theappearanceof anti-inflammatoryandneurotrophicphenotypes ofmicroglia Colton , 2009 , such as Fc epsilon RII CD23 , transforming growth factor ? , and nerve growth factor data not shown . Discussion In this work we demonstrate that CGRP and adrenomedullin can inhibit microglia activation starting from the low nanomolar range . This evidence was obtained by challenging primary cultures of microglia with LPS and assessing the inhibitory effect exerted by the two neuropeptides on the release of molecules reported to have detrimental roles in inflammatory processes , such as cytokines TNF ? , IL6 , NO , and chemokines MIP1 ? , MCP1 Kerschensteiner et al. , 2009 Lehnardt , 2010 . These results extend previous reports of an anti-inflammatory action of CGRP and adrenomedullin in macro-phagic cell lines and primary macrophages Feng et al. , 1997 Liu et al. , 2000 Ma et al. , 2010 Miksa et al. , 2007 Wong et al. , 2005 Wu et al. , 2003 , i.e. cells belonging to the same lineage as microglia . The effects we report were clearly stimulus dependent , as well as cell specific . We employed the well-known paradigm of microglia activation by LPS to induce the release of pro-inflammatory molecules able to activate astrocytes with consequent additional release of cytokines . Indeed , our results provide evidence of an increased release of TNF ? when microglial cells are co-cultured with astrocytes . With this model , we demonstrate that CGRP and adrenomedullin efficiently suppress the LPS-mediated effects . Accordingly , our data point to microglia , not to astrocytes , as the primary target of this cascade of events , in line with a recent cautionary note on the real effects of LPS on pure astrocytes Saura , 2007 . It is worth mentioning that , according to the current view on the neuroinflammatory process during neurodegeneration , microglia is considered the causal player , with astrocytes exerting either a protective feedback role , by limiting microglial activation Harris et al. , 2002 , or a deleterious feed-forward effect , by favoring the development of chronic inflammation Farina et al. , 2007 . Notwithstanding the extent of interplay between microglia and astrocytes , which is far from being elucidated , it is clear that CGRP and adrenomedullin can play an important role on the effects of microglia activation . According to our results , the two neuropeptides reverse the LPS effects rather than redirect microglia to different pathways of activation , such as the anti-inflammatory “alternative activation” or the immunosuppressant “acquired deactivation” phe-notypes proposed in the literature Colton , 2009 . In addition , it should be pointed out that CGRP and adrenomedullin inhibition on microglia activation is exerted on specific pathways . In fact the inhibitory effect was not observed when cells , either astrocytes or microglia , were challenged with a mix of pro-inflammatory cytokines . Since both neuropeptides activate CLR complexes , it can be inferred that a common signal transduction pathway may sustain their effects . Indeed , cAMP is produced upon stimulation of CGRP or adrenomedullin receptors and is thus expected to be involved in the inhibitory activity observed on LPS action . However , elevation of cAMP levels by common pharmacological tools mimicked the effect only partially , thereby suggesting , as already reported Walker et al. , 2010 , that receptor activation stimulates other signaling pathways as well . Interestingly , stimulation of different receptors coupled to adenylyl cyclase showed similar , as well as specific effects . For instance , activation of ? -adrenergic receptors mimicked the action of the two neuropeptides , while activation of EP2 receptors had an opposite effect on NO production . Altogether , the heterogeneous responses we have observed are in line with the possibility that receptors coupled to adenylyl cyclase activation can stimulate , along with cAMP production , also other signaling pathways , thereby driving glia to specific activated phenotypes . Interestingly , the pro-inflammatory reaction caused by LPS implies the initial activation of the Toll-like receptors , a mechanism proposed to be involved in the development of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis EAE , i.e. the main model for multiple sclerosis in mice Farez et al. , 2009 Marta , 2009 . Since it is possible that CGRP and adrenomedullin modulate this pathway , a better definition of their mechanism of action might have a potential impact on this neuroinflammatory pathology . Looking at the possible consequences of microglia activation in the neuroinflammatory processes , we focused on chemokine release . This is a crucial step in the recruitment of leukocytes from the periphery , with ensuing propagation of the inflammatory attack to the parenchyma via Th1 Th17 response Gutcher and Becher , 2007 and further amplification of glia activation in a dangerous feed-forward loop . Noticeably , CGRP and adrenome-dullin strongly inhibited the upregulation of MIP1 ? and MCP1 , two chemokines responsible for the recruitment of T lymphocytes into the parenchyma of the central nervous system . Among the CGRP-induced effects on the central nervous system , its role in the development of neuropathic pain and migraine has attracted most of the attention Recober and Russo , 2009 . Our results bring awareness to the role of CGRP and adrenomedullin as anti-inflammatory agents and , at the same time , open new perspectives in the pharmacological treatment of pathologies characterized by microglia activation and neuroinflammation . In this respect , multiple sclerosis is a paradigm since all demyelinating lesions occur on an inflammatory background that sees the involvement of several cells , including activated microglia and locally recruited lymphocytes and macrophages Lassmann et al. , 2001 . The mechanisms leading to this pathological pattern are complex and poorly understood . It has been hypothesized that unknown inflammatory events may cause a local release of inflammatory cytokines TNF ? , IL1 ? , and IL6 capable of triggering the production of secondary inflammatory mediators , such as chemokines , colony stimulating factors and lipid-derived mole-cules Martino and Hartung , 1999 . Cytokines and chemokines would , in turn , allow the recruitment of leukocytes across the blood–brain barrier , including autoreactive T cells able to interact with resident antigen-presenting cells Engelhardt and Ransohoff , 2005 Flügel et al. , 2007 , such as microglia and astrocytes . This local interplay is considered a crucial event leading to perpetuation and amplification of the inflammatory reaction since the initial damage introduced by T cells is a stimulus for microglia activation and further recruitment of macrophages . Within this pathological framework , activated micro-glia and infiltrating macrophages are expected to produce a large number of harmful soluble factors , such as nitric oxide Redford et al. , 1997 , inflammatory cytokines chemokines Muzio et al. , 2007 , excitotoxins Smith et al. , 2000 , matrix metalloproteinases Leppert et al. , 2001 Lindberg et al. , 2004 and other proteases Anthony et al. , 1998 . However , a view in which microglia might exert a reparative and anti-inflammatory action , with mechanisms still to be clarified , has recently emerged Muzio et al. , 2007 . Based on these premises , the neural-immune activity of CGRP and adrenomedullin might exert either a control on the initial immunological attack to the central nervous system parenchyma , or on subsequent mechanisms of the disease via modulation of glia activation . Interestingly , by working on the EAE mouse model of relapsing– remitting multiple sclerosis we have found that , in the lesion areas with infiltrating lymphocytes , glial cells display changes in CGRP , adreno-medullin and RCP levels Morara et al. , in preparation . Altogether , these findings are in line with the expectation of a possible role played by these neuropeptides in multiple sclerosis . The recent development of non-peptidic antagonists for the CGRP receptor , already in clinical use Doods et al. , 2000 , paves the way also to the discovery of non-peptidic agonists for the same receptor family Katayama et al. , 2001 , which might be employed in the treatment of neuroinflammatory diseases . Finally , our results call attention to the use of CGRP inhibitors , widely employed for the therapy of migraine Durham and Vause , 2010 . In fact , in light of a possible physiological role of these neuropeptides in keeping neuroinflammation at bay , treatments with inhibitors might have previously unpredicted harmful effects . In conclusion , we provide evidence for a role of CGRP and adrenomedullin as modulators of microglia activation . A better comprehension of the molecular basis of their action is expected to advance our knowledge of the neuroinflammation mechanisms as well as to devise new therapeutic paradigms Schreiner et al. , 2009 .

21810597	OBJECTIVE—To assess basal and insulin-mediated VLDL-triglyceride TG kinetics and the relationship between VLDL-TG secretion and hepatic insulin resistance assessed by endogenous glucose production EGP in obese and lean men . RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS—A total of 12 normo-glycemic , obese waist-to-hip ratio .0.9 , BMI .30 kg m2 and 12 lean BMI 20–25 kg m2 age-matched men were included . Ex vivo–labeled [ 1-14C ] VLDL-TGs and [ 3-3H ] glucose were infused postabsorptively and during a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp to determine VLDL-TG kinetics and EGP . Body composi-tion was determined by dual X-ray absorptiometry and computed tomography scanning . Energy expenditure and substrate oxida-tion rates were measured by indirect calorimetry . RESULTS—Basal VLDL-TG secretion rates were increased in obese compared with lean men 1.25 6 0.34 vs. 0.86 6 0.34 mmol kg fat-free mass [ FFM ] min P 0.011 , whereas there was no differ-ence in clearance rates 150 6 56 vs. 162 6 77 mL min P NS , resulting in greater VLDL-TG concentrations 0.74 6 0.40 vs. 0.38 6 0.20 mmol L P 0.011 . The absolute insulin-mediated suppression of VLDL-TG secretion was similar in the groups . However , the percentage reduction 236 6 18 vs . 254 6 10 % P 0.008 and achieved VLDL-TG secretion rates 0.76 6 0.20 vs. 0.41 6 0.19 mmol kg FFM min P , 0.001 were impaired in obese men . Furthermore , clearance rates decreased significantly in obese men , but there was no significant change in lean men 217 6 18 vs . 7 6 20 % P 0.007 , resulting in less percentage reduction of VLDL-TG concentrations in obese men 222 6 20 vs. 256 6 11 % P , 0.001 . Insulin-suppressed EGP was similar 0.4 [ 0.0-0.8 ] vs. 0.1 [ 0.0-1.2 ] mg kg FFM min median [ range ] P NS , and the percentage reduction was equivalent 280 % [ 57–98 ] vs. 298 % [ 49– 100 ] , P NS . Insulin-mediated glucose disposal was significantly reduced in obese men . CONCLUSIONS—Basal VLDL-TG secretion rates are increased in normoglycemic but insulin-resistant , obese men , resulting in hypertriglyceridemia. Insulin-mediated suppression of EGP is pre-served in obese men , whereas suppression of VLDL-TG secretion is less pronounced in obese men . Compared with EGP , the inability to achieve suppression of VLDL-TG secretions to a level similar to control subjects during hyperinsulinemia seems to be an early manifestation in male obesity . Diabetes 60 2257–2264 , 2011 Icholesterol nsulin-resistant conditions , including obesity and type 2 diabetes , are associated with plasma lipid abnor-malities comprising hypertriglyceridemia , low HDL concentrations , small and dense LDL par-ticles , and excessive postprandial lipemia 1–4 . These ath-erogenic lipid abnormalities often precede both impaired glycemic control and overt type 2 diabetes by several years , indicating that altered lipoprotein metabolism is an early event in the development of insulin resistance . Evidence suggests that increased secretion of VLDL–triglycerides TGs , primarily in the subfraction of large , TG-rich VLDL particles VLDL1 , is an early feature of insulin-resistant dyslipidemia , as reviewed in detail elsewhere 5,6 . The impact of male obesity on VLDL-TG and VLDL– apolipoprotein B apoB kinetics has been examined in relatively few studies 7–10 . In studies by Mittendorfer et al. 7,8 , basal VLDL-TG secretion rates into plasma were increased by .150 % in obese compared with lean men , with no significant difference in clearance rates , re-sulting in ~150 % greater VLDL-TG concentrations . Corre-spondingly , in studies by Chan et al. 9,10 , VLDL-apoB secretion rates were increased in obese men . To our knowledge , the suppressive effect of acute hyperinsulinemia on hepatic VLDL-TG secretion has not been studied previously in obese men . In nonobese men , acute hy-perinsulinemia significantly decreased hepatic secre-tion of VLDL-TG 11 and VLDL-apoB 12,13 . Moreover , Mittendorfer et al. 8 explored physiological insulin surges during glucose infusion and found that increased glucose levels acutely decrease VLDL-TG secretion into plasma by ~50 % and VLDL-TG clearance by ~30 % in both obese and lean men . However , with this design , it is not possible to distinguish between the separate effects of hyperglycemia and concomitant hyperinsulinemia on VLDL-TG kinetics . In healthy individuals , endogenous glucose production EGP is suppressed by insulin after a meal , whereby nor-moglycemia is maintained . This ability to maintain postab-sorptive glucose homeostasis is vital , and insulin-mediated reduction in EGP has , therefore , traditionally been used as a surrogate measure of hepatic insulin sensitivity . Like-wise , insulin-mediated suppression of VLDL-TG secretion is appropriate after food ingestion to facilitate the rapid clearance of excess TG from circulation . However , al-though EGP is effectively regulated by insulin in the portal vein secreted in proportion to plasma glucose concen-tration , it is more unclear what regulates postabsorptive lipid homoeostasis . Mechanistic studies have demonstrated that both indirect free fatty acid FFA -dependent and di-rect FFA-independent mechanisms 11,12 are involved in the short-term regulation of VLDL-TG secretion . None have established whether obese individuals lose the sup-pressive effect of insulin on VLDL-TG secretion before its ability to suppress EGP . The purpose of this study was to compare normogly-cemic , obese and lean men and to assess the following 1 postabsorptive VLDL-TG kinetics and 2 the effect of hyperinsulinemia on VLDL-TG metabolism and EGP . We hypothesized that impaired suppression of hepatic VLDL-TG secretion precedes impaired glycemic control in obese men . RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS FIG. 1 .

The basal VLDL– apoB-100 concentration was somewhat greater , although not significantly , in obese men 155 6 93 vs. 109 6 71 mg L P 0.188 and remained unsuppressed by hyperinsulinemia , whereas in lean men a significant reduction P , 0.001 was noted . The achieved concentration was significantly lower in lean men 143 6 85 vs. 57 6 38 mg L P 0.004 . There was no significant difference in the VLDL-TG–to– VLDL-apoB ratio , a measure of particle size , in obese and lean men in the basal period 5.18 6 1.57 vs. 3.94 6 1.57 mmol mg P 0.067 or during hyperinsulinemia 4.44 6 1.68 vs. 3.22 6 1.06 mmol mg P 0.053 Fig. 3H . A slight decrease in the ratio was noted in both groups , but the decrease was significant only in lean men P 0.023 . There was no significant difference between obese and lean men in the absolute 0.72 6 0.95 vs. 0.74 6 1.24 mmol mg or relative decrease 214 6 23 vs. 215 6 22 % P 0.885 Glucose kinetics . Corrected for FFM , EGP was lower in obese compared with lean men in the basal period 2.0 [ 1.7–2.3 ] vs. 2.3 mg kg FFM min [ 2.1–2.6 ] P , 0.001 , whereas a near-complete suppression was achieved during hyperinsulinemia 0.4 [ 0.0-0.8 ] vs. 0.1 [ 0.0-1.2 ] mg kg FFM min median [ range ] P 0.139 . The reduction in EGP dur-ing insulin infusion was significant P , 0.001 in both groups . There was no difference in the relative reduction 80 % [ 57–98 ] vs. 98 % [ 49–100 ] P 0.09 , whereas the absolute reduction was greater in lean men 1.7 [ 1.0–2.0 ] vs. 2.1 mg kg FFM min [ 1.2–2.4 ] P 0.006 Fig. 4A and B .

Energy expenditure and substrate oxidation . The re - spiratory quotient was comparable in the basal period Table 2 , but the relative change in response to hyper-insulinemia was decreased in obese men P 0.010 , reflecting metabolic inflexibility . Accordingly , the relative increase in glucose oxidation and nonoxidative glucose disposal NOGD was decreased in obese men , although the difference was only statistically significant for NOGD P 0.157 and P 0.003 , respectively , whereas the rela-tive reduction in lipid oxidation was decreased in obese men P 0.003 . Correlations . No significant correlations were found be-tween basal VLDL-TG secretion and EGP or serum insulin or between the relative reduction in VLDL-TG secretion and EGP during hyperinsulinemia in either group . In lean men , the M value was significantly related to the VLDL se-cretion rate in the basal state r 20.71 , P 0.01 and during the clamp 20.62 , P 0.03 . No significant relation-ship was found in obese men . No significant relationships were noted between M value and VLDL clearance rates . DISCUSSION In this study , we assessed the impact of male obesity on basal and insulin-mediated VLDL-TG and glucose kinetics . In addition , we explored whether a coordinated relation-ship existed between VLDL-TG secretion rate and EGP in insulin-resistant obese men and lean men . We found that basal VLDL-TG secretion rates were significantly increased in obese men compared with lean men , whereas there was no significant difference in VLDL-TG clearance rates , re-sulting in greater plasma VLDL-TG concentrations . More-over , although the absolute insulin-mediated suppression of VLDL-TG secretion was similar in the two groups , the percentage change was significantly lower in obese men , and the achieved level during insulin suppression was significantly greater in obese men . Furthermore , although clearance rates decreased in obese men , there was no significant change in lean men , resulting in less reduction of VLDL-TG concentrations in obese men . On the other hand , we found no indication of impaired suppression of EGP in obese men despite significant insulin resistance with respect to glucose disposal . The impact of male obesity on basal VLDL-TG and VLDL-apoB kinetics has been examined in relatively few studies , all on the basis of in vivo labeling and mathematical modeling 7–10 . As in the current study , Mittendorfer et al. 7,8 report greater secretion of VLDL-TG in obese men than in lean men . ApoB kinetic studies by Chan et al. 9,10 have extended these findings by demonstrating that apoB production rates a measure of VLDL particle secretion rate are greater in obese subjects than in lean subjects . Taken together with our observation that the apoB-to-TG ratio , and thus VLDL particle size , was comparable in lean and obese men , these findings indicate that more VLDL particles , not larger ones , are secreted from the liver in obese sub-jects compared with lean subjects . Our study differs from the one by Mittendorfer et al. 7 on one point , however we report substantially greater absolute secretion rates of VLDL-TG micromoles per minute . This discrepancy may relate to differences in tracer method glycerol tracer bolus and modeling versus steady-state tracer technique and in body composition . Methods based on in vivo labeling and mathematical modeling rely on a single-pool model , and VLDL-TG secretion rates are calculated by multiplying VLDL-TG pool size by fractional catabolic rate 19 . How-ever , we recently reported that VLDL-TG kinetics are better described by a two-pool model , meaning that fractional catabolic rate and VLDL-TG turnover are underestimated assuming single-pool kinetics 20 . Moreover , the FFM of our obese study subjects was greater than those reported TABLE 2 by Mittendorfer et al. 7,8 . Because we recently found that resting energy expenditure and FFM are significant independent predictors of VLDL-TG turnover 21 , at least some of the difference may be explained by differences in study group phenotype . How insulin regulates VLDL-TG production has been the focus of recent studies prompted by the observation that insulin-resistant individuals are hypertriglyceridemic. Cell and rodent studies have demonstrated that insulin in the hepatocyte acts via the insulin receptor and insulin receptor substrate-2 to activate downstream signaling phosphoino-sitide 3-kinase and protein kinase B , ultimately dislocating FoxO1 from the nucleus of the cell . Because FoxO1 aug-ments microsomal triglyceride transfer protein activity , a key enzyme facilitating the uptake of TG droplets into the VLDL particle 22 , insulin effectively acts as a brake on VLDL-TG secretion . Therefore , the inability of insulin to check the activity of FoxO1 may result in VLDL overproduction be-cause it is observed in insulin-resistant individuals . Impaired inactivation of FoxO1 also contributes to glucose-mediated increases in VLDL production , as demonstrated by Wu et al. 23 . However , insulin not only serves as a brake on VLDL-TG output , it may itself promote hepatic TG production by upregulating lipogenic enzymes , such as sterol regulatory element–binding protein-1c , leading to de novo lipogenesis . This lipogenic effect of insulin may be mediated via acti-vation of insulin receptor substrate-1 and is presumably not lost in insulin-resistant states 24,25 . Taken together , these studies indicate that the effect of insulin on VLDL-TG secretion depends on whether concentrations are raised acutely , leading to inhibition of VLDL-TG secretion or rise more gradually , leading to upregulation of lipogenic en-zymes , de novo lipogenesis , and ultimately VLDL-TG se-cretion . In vivo studies of VLDL-TG kinetics tend to support this notion . Thus , experimental hyperinsulinemia has been shown to decrease VLDL-TG 11 and VLDL-apoB 11–13 . In the semiquantitative study by Lewis et al. 11 , hyper-insulinemia exerted a greater effect on VLDL-TG than on VLDL-apoB , and in the studies by Malmström et al. 12,13 , insulin infusion suppressed VLDL1-apoB secretion with only little effect on VLDL2-apoB secretion . Further-more , the effect of insulin infusion on VLDL kinetics has been compared in subjects with high liver fat 80 % with type 2 diabetes and low liver fat all nondiabetic 26 . Hyperinsulinemia resulted in a rapid decline in VLDL1-TG and VLDL-apoB secretion in the group with low liver fat , whereas there was no significant change in the VLDL1 secretion in the group with high liver fat . Moreover , Lewis et al. 11 demonstrated that hyperinsulinemia still sup-presses VLDL-TG secretion even during simultaneous lipid infusion to stabilize FFA levels , a substrate for VLDL-TG synthesis . In a recent study of type 2 diabetic and age-and BMI-matched healthy men using a design comparable to the current study , except for a greater insulin infusion rate 1.0 mU kg FFM min 27 , we reported that VLDL-TG secretion was significantly suppressed by insulin in both groups . Although we observed no significant difference in the relative suppression of VLDL-TG secretion rates , the relative suppression of VLDL-TG concentration and the VLDL-TG–to–VLDL-apoB ratio was significantly impaired in type 2 diabetic men . Of interest , the reduction in VLDL-TG–to–VLDL-apoB ratio was lower in the current study compared with the study including type 2 diabetic men and healthy men , suggesting that the reduction in VLDL particle TG content in response to hyperinsulinemia is regulated dose dependently . However , other factors could contribute to the difference , such as greater insulin resistance in the obese men in the current study compared with the obese control group in our previous publication , as suggested by greater body weight , fasting serum insulin , and VLDL-TG concentrations . The notion that long-term hyperinsulinemia and hyperglycemia promotes rather than inhibits VLDL-TG output has been demonstrated in humans by Aarsland et al. 28 . We also reported insulin concentrations to be an independent predictor of VLDL-TG secretion in a cross-sectional study 21 . One aim was to explore whether insulin inhibits VLDL-TG secretion and EGP to a similar extent in both lean and obese individuals . We found this interesting because postprandial insulin-mediated suppression of VLDL-TGs and glucose secretion is appropriate to facilitate clear-ance of excess nutrients from circulation . To our knowl-edge , this relationship has not been previously evaluated in human studies . We used gold-standard methods the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp technique was applied to study the isolated effect of moderate hyperinsulinemia , and glucose production and use was determined using [ 3-3H ] glucose tracers in combination with indirect calorim-etry . As a novel observation , we found that insulin-mediated suppression of VLDL-TG secretion was impaired in obese men , whereas , at the same time , the suppression of EGP was preserved in both lean and obese subjects . Although the absolute reduction in VLDL-TG secretion was similar in the two groups , both the percentage change as well as the achieved secretion rate were significantly less pronounced in obese men compared with lean men . The obese partic-ipants therefore seemed to be somewhat insulin resistant with respect to VLDL-TG secretion but not maintenance of normoglycemia . It has been suggested 29 that incomplete global loss of insulin signaling may impact more severely upon some arms of a signaling network than others , according to their different patterns of ligand dose re-sponsiveness . This may explain why insulin-resistant indi-viduals tend to be unable to downregulate VLDL-TG output under conditions of hyperinsulinemia as a result of the loss of the inhibitory effect but still have substantial de novo lipogenesis . The concept of incomplete insulin resistance also could explain why our obese and peripherally insulin-resistant volunteers maintained the inhibitory effect of insulin on EGP while being unable to inhibit VLDL-TG secretion to the same extent as lean men . In accordance with this , despite similar FFA concentrations in the two groups , it is likely that obese men were subjected to greater hepatic FFA delivery from visceral fat lipolysis than lean men , which , in addition to yet-unexplored genetic differ-ences , could contribute to the increased VLDL-TG secretion . The study may have methodological limitations . The VLDL-TG tracer was prepared from plasma obtained in the post-absorptive state , and because VLDL particle composition changes in response to hyperinsulinemia , the VLDL-TG tracer used to determine VLDL-TG kinetics during hyperinsulinemia should ideally have been prepared from plasma obtained during hyperinsulinemia . However , Lewis et al. 30 found no differences in VLDL-apoB kinetics whether plasma was drawn under basal or hyperinsulinemic conditions . Moreover , the relatively low number of subjects could introduce type 2 errors in some statistical comparisons . Regarding VLDL se-cretion , however , we previously found significant reductions during hyperinsulinemia in obese and type 2 diabetic men . In summary , compared with lean men , normoglycemic but peripherally insulin-resistant obese men have 1 greater basal VLDL-TG secretion and similar VLDL-TG clearance rates resulting in increased VLDL-TG concentrations , 2 impaired ability to achieve suppression of VLDL-TG secre-tion to a level similar to control subjects under hyper-insulinemia , and 3 preserved blocking of EGP . Our data indicate that obesity-related insulin resistance may affect VLDL-TG production before gluconeogenesis and glyco-genolysis .

Introduction The need for well-organized in vitro-culture systems , which can mimic an in vivo situation , is still a high priority , in spite of remarkable advances made since the last century . The central nervous system CNS , especially brain or retinal tissues from rat LaVail and Hild , 1971 Rzeczinski et al. , 2006 , mouse Caffé et al. , 1989 , and chicken Kato et al. , 1983 Hoff et al. , 1999 were highly exploited in the development of in vivo-like culture systems that could be employed in different areas of study including embryonic development , cellular differentiation , pharmacology , trans-plantation Johnson and Martin , 2008 Johnson et al. , 2010 and other medical aspects . Several methods have been developed for culturing retinal explants from different species . Earlier techniques involved the usage of different substrata on which retinal tissues were placed for support , including plasma clots Barr-Nea and Barishak , 1970 , and chicken gizzard extracts Kato et al. , 1983 . Histotypic differentia-tion of mouse retina was obtained when tissues were explanted flat on a piece of nitrocellulose membrane Caffé et al. , 1989 . Successful preservation of the cytoarchitecture over a period of several weeks was observed in slice culture techniques from rodent CNS Gähwiler et al. , 1997 . Organotypic organization in chick retinal explants was demonstrated when the tissues were embedded in a fibrin clot on glass cover slips and rotated in roller tubes Hoff et al. , 1999 . Recent developments have paved ways to culture retinal slices from adult rat retina by free floating them in roller drums under constant rotation Rzeczinski et al. , 2006 . Though complete retino-architecture was obtained and main-tained in retinal explants for long culture periods , in either standard or roller cultures , no system has been established up to now that could preserve the development of photoreceptor outer segments . Studies show that photoreceptor outer segments developed to a certain extent when explants were cultured in the presence of retinal pigment epithelium but totally failed in the absence of the latter Caffé et al. , 1989 . Electron microscopic studies also suggested the absence of photoreceptor outer segments in chick retinal explants Araki et al. , 1987 . Our aim was to establish an in vivo-like explant culture system from chick that differed significantly from other systems developed so far . The main difference compared to other explant systems was the absence of any substratum used as a support for the tissues . Instead of slicing the retinal tissues , we used whole retinal tissues as explants which were subjected to continuous and constant orbital rotation . The explants were cultured in a spacious dish rather than using narrow roller tubes , in which they were allowed to float freely in order to obtain a 3D culture environment . We report here a simple but effective culture technique that allowed us to maintain the retinal architecture for at least 2e3 weeks . During the culture periods , the explants reached a near in vivo-like tissue organization . Since we used embryonic chick retina , we were able to follow complete differentiation of all retinal layers , starting from an early neuroblastic stage until the development of photoreceptor outer segments . 2 . Materials and methods Fertilized eggs of White leghorn chicken were purchased from a local hatchery and incubated at 37 C in a humidified chamber until 6 , 10 and 15 days of embryonic development for explant cultures . Different stages starting from embryonic day 6e17 were used to perform parallel in vivo retinal development studies . For explant cultures , eggs were opened at embryonic day 6 E6 and the eyes collected in calcium free Hank’s Basal Salt Solution HBSS . Using a fine scissors the lens was removed by dissection along the ora serrata in such a way that most of the peripheral retina was lost . The vitreous body was next removed with sharp forceps . The central retina which was associated with the pigment epithelium was removed carefully with a spatula without any contamination of the latter . The whole retinal cup was flattened with the ganglion cell layer facing upwards without any damage and cut into two equal parts with a micro scissors see Fig. 1 . For in vivo studies , whole eyes of different stages were collected . 2.1 . Establishment of explant culture The equal retinal halves were transferred to 35 mm culture dishes containing DMEM Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Media with a supplement of 10 % fetal calf serum , 2 % chicken serum , 1 % L-glutamine , and 0.15 % penicillin streptomycin all from Gibco , Berlin , Germany . No substrata such as Millipore filters or poly-cationic substances were used in order to plant the retinal tissues , but , instead , the dishes with explants were placed on a self - made rotatory shaker installed in a Heraeus incubator and allowed to rotate continuously in an orbital manner with a constant speed of 72 rpm . The explant culture was supplied with 95 % air , 5 % CO2 and maintained at 37 C throughout a culture period of 2e3 weeks . Fresh medium was changed every second day . Due to continuous rotation and avoidance of substrata , the tissues were not allowed to adhere to any surface , and thereby kept free-floating and preserving their 3D architecture . 2.2 . Fixation and cryosectioning The explants from different culture days beginning from div 2 till 20 were collected in Eppendorf tubes with 1 ml tips which were cut at the tip to have a wide mouth . The tissues were washed thrice with PBS Phosphate Buffered Saline and fixed in 4 % para-formaldehyde Merck , Darmstadt , Germany for an hour and immersed in 25 % sucrose Roth , Karlsruhe , Germany overnight at 4 C . The fixed explants were transferred to tissue-tec Richard-Allan Scientific solution and sectioned on a cryostat Microm , Heidelberg , Germany at 10e12 mm and mounted on frost-free or gelatine-coated glass slides . The sections were stored at 20 C until further use . Whole eyes for in vivo studies were also fixed in 4 % paraformaldehyde overnight at 4 C , immersed in 25 % sucrose and sectioned as whole mount eyes as mentioned above . 2.3 . Immunocytochemistry Sections of explants and in vivo whole mount eyes were sub-jected to immunostaining in order to follow and compare the development and differentiation of different types of retinal cells in both the systems . Prior to staining procedures , the frozen sections were dried on a heating plate at 37 C . The area around the sections was marked with a greasy liquid blocker Roth , Karlstuhe , Germany and the slides were pre-incubated in blocking solution which contains PBS , 3 % BSA Bovine Serum Albumin and 0.1 % Triton-X-100 for at least 30 min.100 ml of primary antibodies which were diluted in the blocking solution were applied on the sections inside the area which was surrounded by the liquid blocker and then incubated for 90 min at room temperature or overnight at 4 C . In case of double staining , one polyclonal and one monoclonal antibody was mixed and applied together . The slides were washed thrice with PBS and then subjected to 100 ml of fluorescent conju-gated secondary antibodies for 70 min at room temperature . After three PBS washes , the sections were treated with DAPI Merck , Darmstadt , Germany for 3 min in order to stain cell nuclei . The slides were rinsed in distilled water after a final wash in PBS and then dried on the heating plate and embedded in Kaiser’s glycerol gelatine Merck , Darmstadt , Germany . The details of primary and secondary antibodies , their dilutions and sources used in this study were as follows 3D10 antibody binding to AChE , anti-Pax6 for inner retinal cells , H5 vimentin and glutamine synthetase anti-bodies specific for Müller glial cells , and 4H6 antibody specific for neurofilaments were all monoclonal . 3D10 and glutamine synthe-tase antibodies were used at a dilution of 1 200 , and vimentin antibody was used at a dilution of 1 500 . Anti Pax6 was used in a dilution of 1 500 and 4H6 at a dilution of 1 250 . Polyclonal antibodies CERN 901 and CERN 906 were used at a dilution of 1 1500 to recognise rod and cone photoreceptors . Fluorescent-coupled secondary antibody Cy3 donkey-anti-mouse was used against monoclonal antibodies , and Cy2 goat-anti-rabbit was used against polyclonal primary antibodies . Both the secondary anti-bodies were used at a dilution of 1 200 . Sources of antibodies 3D10 antibody was a generous gift from Dr. Karl Tsim , Hongkong , H5 , 4H6 and anti-Pax6 were purchased from Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank , glutamine synthetase from BD Biosciences , CERN 901 and 906 antibodies were generous gifts from Dr.William J. DeGrip , Netherlands and the secondary antibodies Cy2 and Cy3 were from Dianova . 2.4 . Cholinesterase staining Acetylcholinesterase staining was performed by the Karnovsky and Roots technique Karnovsky and Roots , 1964 . In brief , the frozen sections were dried on a heating plate , incubated twice for 15 min in Tris-maleate buffer and treated with the reaction buffer 0.1 M tris-maleate buffer , 0.1 M sodium citrate , 30 mM copper sulphate and 5 mM potassium hexacyanoferrate . The reaction was performed for 1 h at 37 C with 6 mM acetylthiocholine iodide as substrate and 0.1 mM iso-OMPA to inhibit BChE . The reaction produced a brown insoluble precipitate Hatchett’s brown at the site of enzymatic activity which was visible under the light microscope . 2.5 . Microscopy and imaging Immunostained in vivo and explant sections were subjected to fluorescent microscopy Axiophot , Carl Zeiss , Germany which was connected to an automated digital camera Axiocam . Imaging was done for each fluorescent channel separately and processed through extended focus imager , and all the pictures from different channels were combined as overlays and stored in zvi image format by Axiovision Basis software programme . 2.6 . Electron microscopy Eyes from E17 chick embryos and div 17 retinal explants were sectioned , washed three times with PBS , and fixed in a mixture of 2.5 % glutaraldehyde and 1 % formaldehyde in cacodylate buffer , pH 6.8 for 1 h . The sections were then post-fixed in 2 % osmium in cacodylate buffer for 2 h at room temperature . The sections were then contrasted with 2 % uranylacetate at 4 C overnight . After contrasting , the tissues were dehydrated in a graded series of acetone 30e100 % and finally embedded in SPURR 3 , 4 Epox-ycyclohexylmethylcarboxylate , D.E.R 736 , Nonenyl-Bernsteinacid and Dimethylaminomethanol for polymerisation at 74 C for 24 h . ultra-thin sections were cut , stained with uranylcitrate and viewed under a Zeiss electron microscope . At least 24 explants of different embryonic stages E6 , E10 and E15 from each corresponding culture day were used in order to calculate the efficiency of explants in preserving organized structures . All the explants were cryosectioned and stained for DAPI in order to view the formation of different cellular layers . The total number of explants from each embryonic stage that maintained the structures were scored as percentage of organi-zation against the number of culture days . The efficiency of explants to produce and maintain organized structures are rep-resented statistically . Analysis was done using Graphpad Prism software . Statistical significance was assessed by one-way ANOVA Analysis Of Variance followed by Tukey tests for multiple groups . Differences among embryonic stages were considered significant for p 0.05 . 3 . Results 3.1 . A simplified culture system We implemented a simple but effective technique that allowed us to culture the explants not only for long periods but also to give us an opportunity to culture them without the need of any external substratum . The simple strategy of rotating the explants in an orbital direction resulted in folding of the retinal tissues see Fig. 2a . This folding of explants might occur due to massive proliferation and the differential polarity of the different neuronal cell types . The formation of rosettes was rare within the explants and occurred at places where the photoreceptors came into close proximity due to folding of the explants Barr-Nea and Barishak , 1970 , but most of the explants were devoid of rosettes . Since the whole retinal cup was divided only into two equal parts , most of the tissue injuries which might arise due to slicing were avoided . Embryonic day 6 E6 retina was routinely used because i at this stage the retina is not fully mature which allowed us to follow retinal development , study the differentiation processes of cells and compare it with in vivo development ii the pigment epithe-lium is not completely developed at this stage which makes the isolation procedure simple . 3.2 . Preservation of cytoarchitecture The retinal cytoarchitecture was completely preserved in the explants for nearly 2e3 weeks of culture see Fig. 2a and b . Since no substratum was used in our culture system , the explants were completely independent from any supporting materials during their growth . In contrast to monolayer cultures , where Müller cells adopt different morphologies and gene expression patterns , our culture system retained a structure that much more closely resembled normal in vivo-behavior , which is vital for preserva-tion of the retinal tissue architecture . A rotation speed of 72 rpm provided an ideal environment for the explants . A higher rotation speed resulted in tissue damage due to excessive frictions and breakage , while very low rotation speed resulted in adherence of tissues either to their neighbours , or the samples tended to settle to the bottom of the culture dishes data not shown . Impor-tantly , at optimal rotation speed the photoreceptor outer segments could develop and were not lost by friction . However , there was thinning of the ganglion cell layer GCL due to the loss of ganglion cells which is a normal consequence of severing the optic nerve . In addition to E6 retinae , E10 and E15 retinal tissues were used as explants to compare the efficiency of explants in forming regular and higher order organotypic structures . Explants from E6 and E10 were able to survive the culture conditions even until 3 weeks while E15 explants did not keep their structures after one week see Fig. 3 . DAPI staining of the cryosectioned explants revealed a high order of organotypic differentiation in the explants which provided an excellent model system highly comparable to the in vivo retinal development see Fig. 2ceh . After 2 days of explant culture , the cells appeared similar to neuroblasts of E8 in vivo retinas . After 3 div , an IPL was first discernible data not shown , and on the 4th day of culture , the separation of OPL and ONL from the INL could already be noticed . By 8 div , the explants almost appeared like a mature retina with proper formation of the nuclear and plexiform layers . A few pyknotic cells were seen throughout the tissues which might have been the result of apoptosis . 3.4 . Formation of an IPL In the inner plexiform layer , neuropil from different types of amacrine cells , ganglion cells , and also bipolar cells become inter-connected within highly stratified synaptic sublaminae . Specifi-cally , amacrine cell types organize their processes within two main sublayers between cells of the inner nuclear layer INL and the ganglion cell layer GCL . Acetylcholinesterase AChE is an early marker during the formation of the IPL , and AChE immunohisto-chemistry was used here to demonstrate the IPL development in explants . AChE was clearly detectable in E6 embryos , the earliest examined time point data not shown . At 2 days of culture , AChE was found in the developing IPL as a narrow faint band which paralleled the stage of E8 in vivo . By 4 days in vitro , the AChE band had become broader , resulting in further separation of the ama-crine cells to the GCL data not shown . By 10 days in vitro onwards , AChE was detectable in two major subbands in the IPL , exactly paralleling the stages of in vivo see Fig. 4 . A faint AChE staining was seen in a population of cells at the outer border of the INL , corresponding to the population of horizontal cells . AChE enzyme activity by Karnovsky-Roots staining also revealed two IPL sub-bands in explants , and a weak staining in the horizontal cell pop-ulation . A thin layer of stained cells found in the GCL were displaced amacrine cells . The IPL was relatively small compared to in vivo retina and might be due to the absence of ganglion cells . Staining with anti-Pax6 antibody documented the formation of the inner nuclear layer . Though Pax6 is expressed very early during retino-genesis , it is retained by subsets of amacrine cells even at late stages of development . 3.5 . Differentiation of Müller cells The differentiation of Müller cells supposedly takes place late during the embryonic retinal development in vivo . This differen-tiation is associated with proper organization of the retinal struc-ture , and also with the development of photoreceptors and their outer segment formation . Müller cell progenitors express the intermediate filament protein vimentin . During their differentia-tion , they begin to express the enzyme glutamine synthetase , which is actively involved in transamination of extracellular glutamate to glutamine . Hence , we used both vimentin and gluta-mine synthetase as radial glial markers in explants . Vimentin was found to be expressed as early as day 2 in culture data not shown . Labelled cells were found in highly organized manner extending from the ILM to the OPL , where they were found to make horizontal contacts . Differentiation of glial cells was advanced in explants , as compared with the in vivo retina . Glutamine synthetase which is considered to be a differentiation marker was found to be already expressed by 6 div , a time point corresponding to 12 days in vivo data not shown . By 10 div , Müller cells had spread radially throughout the explants , reaching from photoreceptors to the GCL . Their cell bodies were densely stained for glutamine synthetase and were situated in the INL see Fig. 5 . 3.6 . Expression of neurofilaments in explants Neurofilaments are intermediate filament proteins expressed by ganglion cells when they begin to differentiate . In vivo , neurofila-ment expression was seen distributed also in the IPL as subbands with dense staining of the inner limiting membrane and the optic nerve fibers formed by the processes of the ganglion cells . Surprisingly , altough the explant cultures exhibit a “GCL” devoid of ganglion cells , neurofilament expression was still found . Two weakly stained bands were seen in the IPL when compared to five bands in vivo . At 4 days of culture , neurofilament expression was strong in the GCL , but no bands were seen in the IPL . At 10 div , two weak bands were seen in the IPL . This expression pattern raised the question as to which cell types expressed neurofilaments in vitro in the absence of ganglion cells . Though earlier studies had shown that type II cholinergic amacrine cells expressed neurofilaments for short time during their differentiation , we observed a long-term expression of these proteins in our culture system see Fig. 6 . 3.7 . Photoreceptor development is advanced in explants Though photoreceptors are born relatively early , their differen-tiation in vivo occurs only after E15 . Around embryonic day 16 , the photoreceptor cell bodies were oval or round and form the base of a dense stalk which leads to the formation of the outer segment . After 17 days in vivo , the cell bodies were found elongated , the stalk thinned and outer segments developed thereafter data not shown . We used CERN 901 and CERN 906 to detect differentiating rod and cone photoreceptors , respectively . At the onset of differ-entiation , the protein was found to be expressed strongly in cell bodies . During late stages of differentiation , when the outer segments were formed , the staining became restricted to the outer segments although the cell bodies were also weakly stained . In explant cultures , we could follow the same differentiation pattern except for the time sequence . Explants showed an advanced photoreceptor differentiation . Stainings by antibodies CERN 901 and CERN 906 demonstrated the development of rhodopsins and cone opsins as early as 4 days of culture data not shown , which is equivalent to 10 days in vivo . By 10 div , differentiation of photore-ceptors and formation of outer segments became clearly visible see Fig. 7 . This advanced development might have been due to known and unknown factors present in the serum . Moreover , this early maturation in vitro provides an advantage to study the development of the entire retinal structure before the explants reached their culture endpoints . In order to confirm that the explants produced photoreceptor outer segments , electron microscopic studies were performed on ultra-thin sections of div 17 explants . The development of photo-receptor inner segments was normal oil droplets were also noticed in the explants . Surprisingly , structures resembling photoreceptor outer segments were noticed in the explants even in the absence of pigment epithelium . Though the formation of outer segments was clearly indicated , they were spherically elaborated instead of forming lengthy structures . The membrane stacks were not orga-nized but were diffusely arranged in comparison to their regular arrangements of stacks in vivo see Fig. 8 . 4 . Discussion We have highlighted a simple but most effective in vitro-model system to culture embryonic chicken retina for extended periods . In vitro , retinal tissues could be cultured either as monolayers , dissociated cells , slices , reaggregates or explants . Monolayer retinal cultures are quite useful in studying the expression of proteins by individual cells which lack interactions with other cell types , e.g. , the enzyme glutamine synthetase of Müller glia in chick retina could be precociously induced by corticosteroids in the absence of cellecell interactions Dutt and Reif-Lehrer , 1980 . Also , dissociated cell cultures are useful in conducting cell proliferation or apoptotic assays Gustmann and Dünker , 2010 . Reaggregation cultures of embryonic chick retina are of great importance in 3D tissue reconstruction Layer and Willbold , 1994 and tissue engineering Layer et al. , 2002 Rieke et al. , 2008 . Though the above-mentioned culture systems have their own significance and advantages , explants could be considered to mimic more of an in vivo-like environment under favourable conditions because of their tendency to preserve the retinal cytoarchitecture in vitro . The first main difference in our culture system compared with the already existing systems is the absence of any supporting materials or substrata . Though a number of substrata , like plasma or fibrin clots Barr-Nea and Barishak , 1970 Hoff et al. , 1999 , millipore filters Caffé et al. , 1989 , etc. were used as supporting materials for the explants and did not interfere with the growth or development of the latter , we present a more natural environment to the retinal tissues in our system . The second difference is that the explants undergo continuous orbital rotation at an optimal speed of 72 rpm in 35 mm culture dishes . Thereby , the explants were continuously exposed to the media due to their free floating status . The wide space available in the culture dish supported the growth of tissues in a 3D-like environment . We used retinas from E6 chick embryos which are immature at this stage . At the beginning of the culture , the explants represent merely neuroblastic tissues without any cell layers being formed . After two days of culture , the explants started to develop and differentiate very much like that of in vivo retina . We used whole retinal tissue parts as explants instead of slices . Adding to the above-mentioned advantages , such whole retinal parts as explants serve as excellent model systems in following the developmental and differentiation pattern of all retinal layers . In particular , the formation of the inner plexiform layer , and differentiation of specific cell types , contributing to IPL formation , is a feature which might be difficult to follow in other culture systems . During the course of several culture days , the explants gradually reached a cytoarchitecture that is highly comparable to in vivo retina . Above all , the tissues maintained the retinal structure through 2e3 weeks without any considerable distortion . Not surprisingly , the retinal ganglion cells RGCs are lost even before 2 days of culture due to severing of the optic nerve that also resulted in thinning of the IPL . In vivo , a population of amacrine cells termed cholinergic type II amacrine cells or displaced amacrine cells DACs , migrate towards the GCL forming the IPL . Interestingly , in explants the DACs migrated , forming an IPL even in the absence of the GCL . We also used embryos from developmental stages at E10 and E15 to produce explants and to study the efficiency of these explants in forming higher order structures . Explants from E10 were able to produce organized structures that were comparable to explants from E6 , but those from E15 were not able to survive in culture for more than a week only statistical data . A simple explanation could be due to the large size of retinal tissue that had to grow in relatively smaller space . Müller cell differentiation in explants is observable by 6 days in vitro data not shown , the stage that is equivalent to E12 in vivo , as judged by immunostaining for glutamine synthetase , a marker for glial differentiation . In vivo , Müller cells mature only after the 15th embryonic day . Therefore , the explants displayed an advanced differentiation pattern in vitro . The possible explanation could be that some available growth factors or proteins present in the serum might induce an early differentiation . In monolayer cultures and retinal explants , corticosteroids accelerate the differentiation of Müller cells by precociously triggering the enzyme glutamine synthetase Dutt and Reif-Lehrer , 1980 Linser and Moscona , 1981 . This type of early differentiation was also observed in retinal reaggregated spheres own observation . We found the expression of neurofilaments in explants to be surprising as they are specific intermediate filament proteins expressed only at the onset of ganglion cell differentiation McCabe et al. , 1999 . However , recent studies have shown that type II cholinergic amacrine cells in the chick transiently express neuro-filaments Stanke et al. , 2008 . Their transient expression appears to be prolonged in our explants cultures . The most spectacular and innovative advantage of the explant system is the differentiation of photoreceptors , including that of structures resembling outer segments . Most of the earlier culture systems failed to support the development of photoreceptor outer segments Araki et al. , 1987 . The presence of pigment epithelium was required along with the explants to support the formation of outer segments Caffé et al. , 1989 . Our simple explant system supports the formation of photoreceptor outer segments and can maintain its laminar structures outstandingly well for 2e3 weeks even in the absence of pigment epithelium . Electron microscopic studies better resolved the onset of formation of outer segments in explants . Though outer segments were clearly formed , they had not achieved their typical long cylindrical morphology , but appeared elaborated . In addition , the inner membranes were not stacked in parallel , but rather were aligned in confluent long membrane sheets see Fig. 8 . Earlier studies from retinal rudiments of Xenopus laevis have shown similar elaborated outer segment structures in the absence of pigment epithelium Stiemke et al. , 1994 . Similar to the advanced differentiation of Müller cells , the photoreceptors also developed much earlier in vitro by div 4 onwards data not shown . These observations could provide an important link of association between both cell types Wang et al. , 2005 . In reti-nospheres , delaying of Müller cell differentiation by glial specific toxins delayed the differentiation of photoreceptors own observations . In conclusion , our simplified retinal explant culture system promises to provide a well-organized experimental model that could be used to follow and or manipulate the developmental processes over longer periods , especially the development of photoreceptors and their outer segments in vitro without any substrata . Also , our system could become highly useful for studies on the action of growth factors as well as the toxicological effects of foreign agents . Conflict of interest None .

21820098	Introduction Hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathies HSANs are a clinically and genetically heterogeneous group of neurological conditions characterized by peripheral nerve degeneration resulting in a loss of sensory perception accompanied by variable degrees of autonomic dysfunc-tion.1,2 Mutations in several genes were identified for auto-somal-recessive WNK1 [ MIM 605232 ] , NTRK1 [ MIM 191315 ] , IKBKAP [ MIM 603722 ] , NGFB [ MIM 162030 ] , CCT5 [ MIM 610150 ] , and FAM134B [ MIM 613114 ] 3–9 and autosomal-dominant SPTLC1 [ MIM 605712 ] , SPTLC2 [ MIM 605713 ] , RAB7 [ MIM 602298 ] , and ATL1 [ MIM 606439 ] forms 10–13 of HSANs . Hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy type II HSANII [ MIM 201300 ] is characterized by a recessive inheritance , onset of symptoms in the first decade of life , and severe distal sensory loss with minimal autonomic dysfunction.14,15 We previously estab-lished that mutations in the nervous system-specific HSN2 exon of WNK1 cause HSANII3,4 and reported that two founder mutations in the HSN2 exon were responsible for the higher prevalence of HSANII in the French-Canadian population of Quebec.16 Although mutations in WNK1 and FAM134B were shown to cause HSANII in some fami-lies , 3,4,9 the etiology of a substantial number of cases remains unexplained.17 In addition , the functions of WNK1 HSN2 and FAM134B and their role in the peripheral nervous system remain poorly understood . To understand the disease pathophysiology and WNK1 HSN2 function , we used a yeast two-hybrid Y2H screen to identify proteins interacting with the domain encoded by the HSN2 exon . We also performed genome-wide homozy-gosity mapping in a consanguineous Afghan family affected by HSANII . These two parallel approaches converged to the identification of causative mutations for HSANII in KIF1A MIM 601255 , which is a gene encoding a motor protein involved in the anterograde transport of synaptic-vesicle precursors along axons.18 Yeast Two-Hybrid Screen Coimmunoprecipitation and Immunolotting Patients and DNA Samples KIF1A Mutation Screening and Haplotype Analysis Quantitative Real-Time PCR Experiments Immunodetections of Primary-Neuron Culture Lentiviral shRNA-Mediated Knockdown of KIF1A Results To identify proteins interacting with the HSN2 exon of WNK1 , we performed a Y2H screen by using a human fetal brain cDNA library bait , pGBKT7-HSN2 [ Figure 1A ] prey , pGADT7-human fetal brain cDNA library . One of the positive clones identified corresponded to KIF1A Figure 1B . We validated this initial interaction by per-forming a direct Y2H assay with pGBKT7-HSN2 and pGADT7-KIF1A cDNA clone from Kazusa DNA Research Institute Figure 1C , KIF1A lane . We then performed separate Y2H interaction assays between the domain encoded by the HSN2 exon and 17 overlapping fragments of KIF1A and identified three distinct KIF1A segments interacting with the domain encoded by the HSN2 exon Figures 1C and 1D . Coimmunoprecipitation of KIF1A and WNK1 HSN2 from HEK293 cells expressing a trun-cated form of WNK1 HSN2 further validated the interac-tion between WNK1 HSN2 and KIF1A Figure 2 . Clinical Description of the Afghan Family Three Afghan brothers born from first-degree cousins pre-sented at Shariati Hospital , Tehran , and were accompa-nied by their father . The index patient individual IV 2 , Figure 3 was 13 years of age and reported an age of onset of 10 years . He presented with numbness in his feet and hands and mutilation of the fingers and toes but did not complain of weakness . The problem had gradually worsened , and he had developed ulcerative lesions refrac-tory to therapy these lesions led to amputation . The patient’s past medical history was unremarkable , and he had no other neurological disorders . On examination , his mental state and cranial nerves were normal . Muscle strength was normal in the proximal upper extremities . In the hands , the first dorsal interossei was 4 5 , the abductor pollicis brevis was 3 5 , and the finger extension was 4 5 . Intrinsic hand muscles were slightly wasted . In the lower extremities , hip flexors were 5 5 , foot dorsiflex-ors were 0 5 , and plantar flexors were 4 5 . He had wasting of the pretibial and calf muscles . Deep tendon reflexes were generally absent . All fingers were mutilated , and only one toe was intact . Pinprick and touch were normal , but vibration and position sense was absent in his feet and hands . Nerves were not hypertrophic . Nerve-conduc-tion studies showed normal ulnar motor , reduced median compound muscle action potential CMAP amplitude , and slightly reduced motor velocities . Tibial and peroneal motor potentials were absent sural and superficial pero-neal sensory potentials were absent and ulnar and median sensory potentials had a very low amplitude . Motor unit action potentials MUAPs were neurogenic in the first dorsal interosseus FDI and tibialis anterior TA muscles . Patient IV 3 was 9 years old . Clinical manifestations had started a year earlier and included mutilation of the digits , particularly the toes , which were all mutilated on examina-tion . Muscle strength was normal in the upper extremities , where there was no wasting . Hip flexors , quadriceps , and gastrocnemius were 5 5 foot dorsiflexors were 4 5 and leg and foot muscles were wasted . Deep tendon reflexes were 1 ? in upper extremities , and knee and ankle jerks were absent . Pinprick and touch senses were normal , and vibration was impaired in the feet and hands . Median and ulnar motor nerve conduction velocities NCVs were normal . Tibial and peroneal CMAPs were absent . Sural , median , and ulnar sensory potentials were absent . Needle examination of tibialis anterior muscle showed neurogenic MUAPs . Patient IV 4 was 7 years old at examination and pre-sented with mutilation of the right foot . The left foot and fingers had only minor changes , and there was no muscle wasting . Muscle strength was normal except for foot dorsiflexors , which were 4 ? 5 . Deep tendon reflexes in the biceps and the triceps were 1 ? deep tendon reflexes in the knee , ankle , and brachioradialis were absent . Pinprick sense was normal vibration and position senses were impaired in the hands and feet . There was no nerve hypertrophy . Median and ulnar motor NCVs were normal . Tibial and peroneal CMAPs were of low amplitude and had slightly reduced onduction velocities . Sural sensory potential was absent median and ulnar sensory potentials were of very low amplitude and had mildly reduced conduction velocities . Needle examination of ti-bialis anterior muscle showed mildly neurogenic MUAPs . Overall , the clinical picture was consistent with an ulcero-mutilating sensory neuropathy with prominent involvement of position and vibration senses and concom-itant distal motor involvement , particularly in the feet . Genome-wide Homozygosity Mapping Genetic analysis of the Afghan family revealed neither mutation in WNK1 nor linkage to the WNK1 chromo-somal locus . Given the parental consanguinity , we per-formed a homozygosity mapping to map the disease locus . A unique region of homozygosity larger than 1 Mb was identified on chromosome 2q37.3-qter spanning 2.68 Mb and comprising 38 known genes Table 1 , among which is KIF1A , which encodes the protein we identified in our Y2H screen . Marker rs1465820 was identified as the proximal recombinant breakpoint , and no distal recombination event occurred . Among the 276 consecu-tive SNPs homozygous for the same alleles in the three affected individuals , 105 were found in a heterozygous state in the father , as expected for a recessive mode of inheritance 20 of them are shown in Figure 3 . KIF1A Mutation Screening and Haplotype Analysis Previously reported homozygous KIF1A-knockout mice showed severe motor and sensory deficits and a substantial extent of neuronal death.22 These observations led us to speculate that the interaction between the domain encoded by the HSN2 exon of WNK1 and KIF1A was rele-vant to the pathogenesis of HSANII . KIF1A comprises 47 exons 46 coding plus three alternatively spliced coding exons that we here refer to as 13b , 25b , and 36b . Sequencing of the coding exons and flanking intronic sequence of the gene in the Afghan family revealed a 1 bp deletion GenBank accession number AB290172.1 c.2840delT [ p.Leu947Argfs*4 ] in the alternatively spliced exon 25b , which would be predicted to cause a frameshift . This mutation was homozygous in all three affected indi-viduals , heterozygous in the father family 1 , Figure 4 , and not present in 665 population controls of European ancestry . We then screened KIF1A in a cohort of 112 unre-lated HSAN cases negative for mutations in the HSN2 exon 23 of these cases were HSANII Table 2 . The c.2840delT mutation was again found in a homozygous state in four patients from two unrelated families from Turkey and Belgium families 2 and 3 , Figure 4 and in a heterozygous state in another Belgian patient . This last individual also carried in exon 46 a heterozygous 1 bp insertion predicted to cause a frameshift and a premature stop codon GenBank accession number AB290172.1 c.5271dupC [ p.Ser1758Glnfs*7 ] . Segregation analysis confirmed the compound heterozygous state of this last patient the c.2840delT and c.5271dupC mutations were transmitted by the mother and father , respectively family 4 , Figure 4 . No truncating mutations in KIF1A , either in a heterozygous or in a homozygous state , were detected in the 665 control individuals 1330 chromosomes , further confirming that truncating mutations in KIF1A cause HSANII . Haplotype analysis by genotyping 34 SNPs located within the KIF1A locus in all four families identified a shared haplotype of approximately 45 kb flanking the c.2840delT mutations . However , given the high frequency of this haplotype block in the HapMap CEU population , it remains unclear whether these mutations originated from a common ancestor or arose independently Table 3 . Affected indi-viduals from three of the four families families 1 , 2 , and 4 with KIF1A mutations were initially diagnosed with HSANII . Patients from the fourth family family 3 had Unrelated Type Inheritance Individuals HSANI HSANIB CMT2B AD 28 HSANII AR 23 HSANIII AR 2 HSANIV AR 4 HSANV AR 1 Unspecified unknown 47 Total 112 Inclusion criteria unrelated patients with clinical features belonging to the clin-ical spectrum of ulcero-mutilating sensory neuropathies . 62 patients were negative for mutations in the HSN2 exon of WNK1 and for mutations in SPTLC1 , RAB7 , WNK1 , NTRK1 , NGFB , and CCT5.17 Abbreviations are as follows CMT2B , Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy type 2B AD , autosomal dominant AR , autosomal recessive . a slightly later age of onset and , despite the lack of evidence for an autosomal-dominant pattern of inheri-tance , were diagnosed as having a severe form of HSANI Table 4 . Similarly to patients presenting with WNK1 mutations3 and unlike patients with FAM134B muta-tions , 9 individuals with KIF1A mutations showed no clin-ical autonomic dysfunction . Analysis of KIF1A Splicing Events Exon 25b was originally identified in a brain-expressed human mRNA , and this isoform is predicted to encode a 1791 amino acid peptide GenBank accession number BAG06726.1 . A sequence cluster alignment based on multi-species alignment from the UCSC Genome Browser indicated that this exon and its splice junctions are conserved through evolution Figure S1 . To further confirm that exon 25b is an alternatively spliced exon of KIF1A , we performed RT-PCR reactions with human RNA samples and primers located within exon 25b and its neighboring exons Figures 5A and 5B and observed that the KIF1A exon-25b-containing isoform was strongly ex-pressed in the nervous system . Real-time quantitative PCR experiments revealed that the KIF1A isoform lacking exon 25b was the most abundant form in both adult brain and DRG . The relative abundance of the exon-25b-con-taining isoform was nonetheless higher in the DRG Figure 5C , which is consistent with the peripheral nervous system phenotype observed in patients lacking this isoform . Long-range RT-PCR reactions were initiated with sets of primers flanking the region between the first coding exon of KIF1A and exon 25b and the region between exon 25b and the last exon of KIF1A sequencing PCR products confirmed the extent of the entire coding sequence of this specific isoform in the brain and DRG Figures 5D and 5E . To follow up on our observations that WNK1 HSN2 and KIF1A interact at the protein level , we used anti-HSN2 and anti-KIF1A antibodies to examine the localization of the two proteins in cultured primary sensory neurons prepared from adult mouse DRG . Both proteins were found to localize in cell bodies and along axons Figures 6A–6E . Using identical cells , our group previously showed that WNK1 localized exclusively in the cell body , whereas WNK1 HSN2 localized in both the cell body and the axons.4 Given the localization of this second isoform and the well-established role of KIF1A in anterograde transport , we hypothesized that KIF1A could be respon-sible for the anterograde transport of WNK1 HSN2 along axons.18 To test this hypothesis , we used lentiviral delivery of shRNAs to silence KIF1A Figures 6F–6J . Infection of cultured DRG sensory neurons substantially reduced KIF1A in cell bodies and rendered it undetectable in axons Figure 6G but did not reduce WNK1 HSN2 in axons Figure 6H . This last observation suggests that KIF1A might not be the only transporter of WNK1 HSN2 along axons . However , we can not rule out the possibility that the reduced remaining amount of KIF1A protein Figures 5F and 5G was still sufficient for the transport of WNK1 HSN2 . Discussion Our study used two parallel approaches , homozygosity mapping and identification of the binding partners of the domain encoded by the HSN2 exon . These approaches converged to allow us to identify HSANII-causative mutations in the KIF1A gene . Similarly to muta-tions in the HSN2 exon of WNK1,4,17 all the patients carry mutations in an alternatively spliced exon , at least in a heterozygous state . The HSANII link to the alternatively spliced exon 25b of KIF1A is further supported by Y2H data that showed that , in addition to other regions of KIF1A , the amino acids encoded by this exon participate in the interaction with the HSN2 portion of WNK1 Figures 1C and 1D . Similarly to HSANII patients with WNK1 muta-tions , all individuals with KIF1A mutations presented with marked sensory loss and severe mutilations . However , they also showed distal muscle weakness , which is not a typical feature of HSANII patients Table 4 . A variable motor involvement is nonetheless well documented in other HSAN types , particularly in the autosomal-dominant forms.10–13 The only compound heterozygous patient with a muta-tion in exon 46 exhibits the most severe motor phenotype and is the only one presenting with developmental delay and short stature Table 4 an interesting observation when one considers that homozygous KIF1A-knockout mice display severe motor and sensory deficits , die within Additional Information Changes Mutations ulcerations , grafts ulcerations ulcerations ulcerations ulcerations Skin skin joint magnetic CG , pronounced wheelchair , Charcot terminal exam MRI , KIF1A mutations will be needed if researchers are to deter-mine whether such a genotype-phenotype correlation exists . Two recent studies reported potential pathogenic muta-tions in KIF1A . Hamdan et al. identified a de novo missense mutation in a patient with nonsyndromic intel-lectual disability , 24 and Erlich et al. found a homozygous missense change in a single consanguineous family with Hereditary Spastic Paraparesis.25 Both mutations were located in the kinesin motor domain of KIF1A . Although these mutations were reported in single families and hence should be interpreted with caution , it is noteworthy that all the HSANII patients carrying mutations in KIF1A present with variable degrees of muscle weakness and that one of them has a speech delay . Although we showed that KIF1A interacts with WNK1 HSN2 and both proteins colocalize along axons of DRG sensory neurons , the functional role of this interaction remains unclear . KIF1A did not appear to be responsible for the presence of WNK1 HSN2 along axons despite its well-established role in anterograde transport andthediffer-ential localization between the WNK1 and WNK1 HSN2 isoforms in DRG sensory neurons . Interestingly though , WNK1 phosphorylation of synaptotagmin-2 , which is transported with synaptic vesicle precursors by KIF1A , 18 reduces its binding to phospholipid vesicles.26 In addition , the phosphorylation state of kinesins modulates both cargo insertion and removal27 and influences the binding of kine-sins to microtubules.28 Therefore , it can be hypothesized that the kinase activity of WNK1 HSN2 regulates the un-loading of KIF1A cargos at axonal tips of neurons , and such a hypothesis is consistent with the slightly increased colocalization of KIF1A and WNK1 HSN2 at the distal portion of axons Figure 6C . Of note , the two frameshift mutations identified here are located downstream of the motor and the Forkhead-associated FHA domains of KIF1A , but both are predicted to affect the C-terminal lipid binding Pleckstrin homology PH domain Figure 4C , which is necessary for vesicle transport.29 Although the functional relationship between KIF1A and WNK1 HSN2andtheroleoftheKIF1Aexon-25b-containing isoform remain to be elucidated , this study identifies muta-tions of KIF1A as a rare cause of HSANII and provides clues to the pathogenesis of HSANII and the function of WNK1 HSN2 in addition to further emphasizing the essential role of KIF1A in the peripheral nervous system . Finally , for both WNK1 and KIF1A , the mutations were largely restricted to alternatively spliced exons , underscoring the importance of alternative splicing in the peripheral nervous system .

21828152	PURPOSE . To determine the interobserver and intraobserver measurement reproducibility of cornea parameters of both normal eyes and eyes with bullous keratopathy BK obtained with the Zhongshan Assessment Program ZAP on anterior segment optical coherence tomography AS-OCT images . METHODS . A comparative study was carried out on 24 healthy volunteers and 25 subjects with BK . AS-OCT images were independently analyzed by two examiners . Parameters exam-ined anterior chamber depth ACD , central corneal thickness CCT , posterior corneal curvature PCC , and posterior cor-neal arc length PCAL . Interobserver and intraobserver repro-ducibility of these parameters was calculated in terms of limits of agreement mean of differences 1.96SD of differences . RESULTS . In the normal group , both horizontal and vertical ACD were successfully measured in 23 of 24 96 % images . The mean bias for two measurements by two different observers ranged from 0.003 to 0.117 mm for ACD , PCC , and PCAL measurements and from 0.013 to 2.25 m for CCT measure-ments , and there were no differences between the two observ-ers P 0.05 . Mean bias for two measurements by the same grader ranged from 0.005 to 0.327 mm for ACD , PCC , and PCAL measurements and 1.46 to 2.53 m for CCT measure-ments . There was no difference between the two observations P 0.05 . Similar results were found in the BK group . CONCLUSIONS . There was high inter-and intraobserver reproduc-ibility for normal and pathologic corneas using the ZAP soft-ware . The ZAP software may serve as a new investigatory tool for accurately evaluating the anterior segment and corneal parameters for corneal procedures . Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci . 2011 52 8884–8890 DOI 10.1167 iovs.10-6411 AVisantesegment nterior optical coherence tomography AS-OCT , Carl Zeiss Meditec , Dublin , CA is a rapid , non - Carl Zeiss Meditec , Dublin , CA is a rapid , non-contact modality for imaging the anterior segment.1–4 It is capable of real-time imaging of a cross-section of the entire cornea , both angles as well as the anterior lens surface , and its ease of acquisition makes it ideal for quantitative measurement of corneal parameters.1 Quantitative measurements of corneal and anterior segment parameters have become increasingly important in the era of modern anterior segment surgery . Accurate measurements of the internal cornea diameter would , for example , enable cor-neal surgeons to accurately size endothelial grafts for endothe-lial keratoplasty procedures , such as Descemet’s stripping automated endothelial keratoplasty DSAEK .5 Precise mea-surements of the internal corneal width would allow for better sizing of anterior chamber phakic intraocular lenses IOLs .6 The follow-up of other novel corneal refractive pro-cedures e.g. , implantation of a corneal stromal inlay for the correction of presbyopia AcuFocus , Inc. , Irvine , CA 7 is de-pendent on accurate imaging of the implant and precise mea-surement of the depth of implantation . The Zhongshan Assessment Program ZAP Guangzhou , China is a customized algorithm software developed to obtain quantitative measurements of anterior segment parameters from AS-OCT images . Both its clinical and research utility and its measurement reproducibility have been documented for measurements of the anterior chamber angle.8 Modification of the software allows quantitative measurements of corneal pa-rameters such as central corneal thickness CCT , posterior corneal curvature PCC , and posterior corneal arc length PCAL , a novel parameter defined as the distance between sclera spurs.9 This distance gives a good approximation of the internal corneal width , a parameter that has not previously been accurately and reproducibly measured . Quantitative mea-surements are objective and repeatable , and thus are useful for the diagnosis and subsequent follow-up of anterior segment conditions . However , the accuracy of quantitative measure-ments is influenced by the reproducibility of the instrument used . The aim of this study was to evaluate the reproducibility of corneal measurements in AS-OCT images of both normal corneas and corneas with bullous keratopathy BK using the ZAP software . This would allow validation of the software for future studies . SERI 2008 . Submitted for publication August 15 , 2010 revised February 10 and July 5 , 2011 accepted July 17 , 2011 . Disclosure J.B.

The ethnicity of normal subjects was distributed as follows 12 Chinese , 7 Indian , 3 Malay , and 2 Burmese . Intraobserver Reproducibility . In both horizontal and ver-tical meridians , the mean of differences bias between two re-peated measurements by the same grader was small , and LOA values were correspondingly small . In the horizontal meridian , intraobserver bias was 0.196 mm for PCAL P 0.189 , 0.005 mm for ACD P 0.941 , and 0.055 mm for PCC P 0.613 measure-ments , respectively , and was 2.533 m for CCT P 0.788 mea-surements . In the vertical meridian , intraobserver bias was 0.327 mm for PCAL P 0.082 , 0.015 mm for ACD P 0.649 , and 0.006 mm for PCC P 0.946 measurements , and was 1.463 m for CCT P 0.874 measurements Table 1 and Fig. 3 . Interobserver Reproducibility . Comparing parameter for parameter , the mean of differences between two graders was lower for all parameters except horizontal ACD and horizontal PCC .

The bias was 0.06 mm for PCAL P 0.104 , 0.037 mm for ACD P 0.275 , and 0.059 mm for PCC P 0.065 measurements , and was 0.371 m for CCT P 0.767 measurements Table 2 . Interobserver Reproducibility . When horizontal mea-surements were performed by two graders , the mean of differ-ences was smaller than that of repeated horizontal measure-ments by the same grader . The interobserver bias was 0.0017 mm for PCAL P 0.761 , 0.00046 mm for ACD P 0.741 , and 0.043 mm for PCC P 0.311 measurements , and was 1.57 m for CCT P 0.315 measurements . The limits of agreement for measurements by two graders was correspond-ingly small . Agreement for interobserver measurements was equally strong for all parameters measured Table 2 and Fig. 4 . DISCUSSION In this study , we found that the ZAP software was a highly reproducible tool for quantitative analysis of corneal parame-ters measured on AS-OCT . Mean of differences between mea-surements by the same grader was found to be small for parameters in both the normal and the BK groups . Means of differences between measurements by different observers were also found to be small in both groups , and limits of agreement were high for both interobserver and intraobserver variation . Interestingly , P values were marginally significant for two parameters measured by the same observer . These param-eters were vertical PCAL in the normal group P 0.082 and horizontal PCC in the BK group P 0.065 . These same parameters had high P values for measurements by different observers . There does not appear to be a reason for the low P values moreover , all P values were found to be 0.05 . Because the reproducibility of AS-OCT has been previously documen-ted , 9,17–21 these observations validate the reproducibility and thus the clinical utility of the ZAP software , given that it demonstrates that differences between users of the software tend to be small thus valid comparisons between analyses by different users can be made . In addition , this study found that the ZAP software showed the repeatability of measurements in both normal and diseased corneas , thus validating its use in a clinical setting to diagnose and follow-up cornea pathology . The cornea parameters measured in this study included the anterior chamber depth ACD , posterior cornea curvature PCC , central cornea thickness CCT , and posterior corneal arc length PCAL . The PCAL is a novel cornea parameter that has not previously been accurately and reproducibly measured , and to our knowledge , the ZAP software is the only image processing software able to do so . Although the other three parameters ACD , PCC , and CCT can be manually measured on AS-OCT scans using the in-built measurement tool , image processing using the ZAP software uses algorithms to identify the borders of the cornea endothelium , epithelium , and ante-rior surface of the iris . This avoids potential inaccuracies that can arise from manual placement of the AS-OCT measurement tool on the AS-OCT image , which may be done in an arbitrary fashion . In addition the software gives new values not able to be calculated with current “in-built ” software . The ability to reproducibly measure cornea parameters has a myriad of clinical and research applications . In particular , the advent of lamellar and refractive cornea procedures necessi-tates accurate measurement of the CCT and PCAL . The PCAL is a novel parameter defined as the posterior corneal border distance between scleral spurs . This gives a good estimation of the limits of the diameter of the corneal endothelium . Its potential utility is particularly relevant to endothelial kerato-plasty EK procedures such as DSAEK and Descemet’s mem - Limit Upper Agreement Limits Lower Software ZAP with Analyzed Keratopathy Bullous with Corneas SD Observer Mean Variability SD Observer Mean Intraobserver and variability Interobserver 2 . brane endothelial keratoplasty , where accurate preoperative measurement of the PCAL in a recipient can guide an appro-priate choice of donor graft diameter . Currently , most surgeons “guesstimate ” the appropriate EK size graft from measure-ments of the anterior corneal surface , 22 similar to what is conventionally done for penetrating keratoplasty PK . The advantage of an EK procedure is that the surgeon can trans-plant much larger grafts , and thus more endothelium than that for conventional PK . In our center , the mean size of the EK graft is 8.75 mm range , 7–10 mm , mode 9 mm , 23 whereas that for PK is 8 mm range , 6.5–11.5 mm , mode 7.5–7.9 mm.23 The additional 1-mm increase in the graft area adds a 26 % increase in the amount of endothelial cells transplanted.24 Thus , optimal graft sizing can have a direct impact on the amount of endothelial cells transplanted . The choice for hori-zontal scans was used because the horizontal meridian is larg-est and thus most appropriate for DSAEK cases . AS-OCT can be used to image patients with EK postopera-tively , and recent further modification of the ZAP software can be used to calculate the diameter of the implanted endothelial graft , providing useful clinical parameters for subsequent fol-low-up of these patients . Further work is under way to validate the DSAEK graft measurements from AS-OCT images using a modification of the ZAP software in a comparison with intra-operative graft trephine diameter . There are a number of other anterior segment procedures for which the ZAP software has potential utility , both in pre - operative assessment and in postoperative follow-up . For ex-ample , in anterior chamber phakic IOL implantation , measure-ment of the PCAL and ACD allows the surgeon to accurately select an appropriate size implant preoperatively . Postopera-tive measurement of these parameters is useful in determining if the implant has been placed in an optimal position subse-quent follow-up measurements can determine whether the implant shifts or subluxes with time . The other strength of this study is the high limits of agreement between observers and those within one observer , suggesting the high repeatability of the software . The ZAP software has some limitations . First , image pro-cessing was dependent on the manual identification of the scleral spur as a measurement reference point . The difficulty of this practice has been well recognized.2,3,10,16 In a cross-sec-tional study of 502 eyes , Sakata and colleagues24 found the detectability of the sclera spur on AS-OCT images to be 72 % overall , and was less detectable on AS-OCT images obtained in the superior 64 % and inferior 67 % quadrants . To overcome this limitation , the ZAP software has an in-built magnification window that can be moved to any position on the scan . We found the placement of this window over the scleral spurs to be highly useful in determining their exact position . In addi-tion , during vertical scan acquisition , the subject’s eyelids were gently held apart to ensure that the lids did not obscure the scleral spurs . This increased the detectability of the scleral spur in our study , and we were able to detect the scleral spur in all AS-OCT images analyzed . This is particularly important if one is planning on using this software to estimate the graft size since the major limitation will be the vertical graft size . The ZAP software is also limited in that it is unable to process high-resolution spectral-domain SD OCT images . This is due to the limited 6-mm scan width of the SD-OCT , which is unable to image more than one angle concurrently in one image . Thus , the ZAP software is able to process only time-domain OCT images , which have a lower resolution but a larger scan width than can encompass both angles in the same image . Finally , the limitation of this study lies in the small sample size , and that analysis was done in a variety of bullous kera-topathies that were not stratified . In conclusion , the Zhong-shan Assessment Program offers accurate measurement of cor-nea parameters from AS-OCT images with good inter-and intraobserver reproducibility , for scans in both the horizontal and vertical meridians . The program is relatively easy to run , with manual identification of the sclera spur as the only ob-server input required . The data obtained from the scans allow detailed quantitative analysis of the anterior segment , which is useful for the preoperative planning of many anterior segment procedures .

21831969	OBJECTIVE—The TrialNet Study Group evaluated rituximab , a B-cell–depleting monoclonal antibody , for its effect in new-onset patients with type 1A diabetes . Rituximab decreased the loss of C-peptide over the first year of follow-up and markedly depleted B lymphocytes for 6 months after administration . This article analyzes the specific effect of rituximab on multiple islet auto-antibodies . RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS—A total of 87 patients between the ages of 8 and 40 years received either rituximab or a placebo infusion weekly for four doses close to the onset of diabetes . Autoantibodies to insulin IAAs , GAD65 GADAs , insulinoma-associated protein 2 IA2As , and ZnT8 ZnT8As were measured with radioimmunoassays . The primary outcome for this autoantibody analysis was the mean level of autoanti-bodies during follow-up . RESULTS—Rituximab markedly suppressed IAAs compared with the placebo injection but had a much smaller effect on GADAs , IA2As , and ZnT8As . A total of 40 % 19 of 48 of rituximab-treated patients who were IAA positive became IAA negative versus 0 of 29 placebo-treated patients P , 0.0001 . In the subgroup n 6 treated within 50 days of diabetes , IAAs were markedly suppressed by rituximab in all patients for 1 year and for four patients as long as 3 years despite continuing insulin therapy . Independent of rit-uximab treatment , the mean level of IAAs at study entry was mark-edly lower P 0.035 for patients who maintained C-peptide levels during the first year of follow-up in both rituximab-treated and placebo groups . CONCLUSIONS—A single course of rituximab differentially sup-presses IAAs , clearly blocking IAAs for .1 year in insulin-treated patients . For the patients receiving insulin for .2 weeks prior to rituximab administration , we can not assess whether rituximab not only blocks the acquisition of insulin antibodies induced by insulin administration and or also suppresses preformed insulin autoantibodies . Studies in prediabetic non–insulin-treated patients will likely be needed to evaluate the specific effects of rituximab on levels of IAAs . Diabetes 60 2560–2565 , 2011 A lthough the anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody rit-uximab Rituxan Genentech , Biogen-IDEC Phar-maceuticals originally was introduced for therapy of B-cell lymphomas 1 , and subsequently ap-plied to a series of antibody-mediated autoimmune dis-orders , it also has a role in what were thought to be classic T-cell–mediated autoimmune disorders , such as multiple sclerosis 2,3 . In several of these diseases , therapeutic responses occur without a change in levels of characteristic autoantibodies . For some immune-mediated disorders , it has been reported that only a subset of autoantibodies decreases following rituximab . For example , it has been reported that rituximab therapy does not decrease the overall thyrotropin receptor–binding antibody , whereas stimulatory thyrotropin receptor–binding antibodies were decreased 4 . The etiology of this differential effect is unknown , but it has been hypothesized to relate to the site of autoantibody production , with the observation that although rituximab does not target plasma cells , it does alter tertiary lymphoid structures and short-lived plasma cells that do not reside in the bone marrow 5 . The quantitative effect of rituximab on islet autoanti-bodies in patients with diabetes has not been described . Type 1A , or immune-mediated , diabetes is believed to re-sult from T-cell–mediated destruction of islet b-cells 6 . Although T cells are dominant determinants of b-cell de-struction in the NOD mouse , and diabetes has been reported in one child lacking B cells 7 , multiple studies document a role for both B lymphocytes and autoanti-bodies in the NOD mouse model 8–11 . For both humans and the NOD mouse , anti-CD20 antibodies suppress dis-ease progression 11,12 . The study by Pescovitz et al. 12 documented the preservation of C-peptides relative to placebo patients at the 1-year follow-up see Supplemen-tary Appendix . In this study , we analyzed the effects of rituximab on islet autoantibody levels in both placebo-and rituximab-treated new-onset patients from this trial , using a fluid-phase radioimmunoassay to detect autoantibodies against multiple islet antigens autoantibodies to insulin [ IAAs ] , GAD65 [ GADAs ] , insulinoma-associated protein 2 [ IA-2 IA2As ] , and ZnT8 [ ZnT8As ] .

RESULTS Of patients treated with rituximab who were initially IAA positive before the trial , 40 % 19 of 48 became negative within the first 12 months after the diagnosis of diabetes Table 1 . In contrast , no placebo patient 0 of 29 became IAA negative P , 0.001 . Rituximab did not significantly influence the percentage of subjects who became negative for GADAs , IA2As , or ZnT8As . In the subgroup of six individuals who were treated within 50 days of diagnosis of diabetes who received 50 days of insulin therapy , IAAs were markedly suppressed by rituximab in all patients for 1 year and in four patients for as long as 3 years , despite continuing insulin therapy . Figure 1 illustrates the mean levels of IAAs Fig. 1A , GADAs Fig. 1B , IA2As Fig. 1C , and ZnT8As Fig. 1D over time from trial entry . Overall , IAAs did not decrease in placebo-treated patients , whereas the IAA mean level in the rituximab-treated group was suppressed by ~75 % at 6 months P , 0.001 , with the suppression continuing for the 12 months of follow-up . As shown in Fig. 2A , the IAA levels of patients treated with rituximab soon after insulin therapy remained low for .1 year compared with most placebo-treated patients , and nearly one-half of patients did not increase to an index .0.1 with up to 3 years of follow-up . All but one of the placebo-treated patients who entered into the study within 50 days of diabetes onset developed an IAA index .0.5 , and most patients rapidly achieved such levels shortly after diagnosis , as expected with a subcutaneous insulin injection . In the same patients , GADAs , IA2As , and ZnT8As were relatively stable after rituximab or placebo injections , independent of rituximab injection . Study participants were divided into two subgroups , independent of rituximab treatment , on the basis of their C-peptide levels during the follow-up , defined as responders and nonresponders in both rituximab-and placebo-injection groups . The categorization was performed without knowl-edge of IAA status . Surprisingly , IAA levels were signifi-cantly lower P , 0.05 in subjects defined as responders versus those who were nonresponders at time 0 for both rituximab and placebo groups Fig. 3A . The level of IAAs was remarkably lower in the placebo group from baseline until the 12-month follow-up , whereas the IAAs in the rituximab-treated group were suppressed after treatment . A significantly lower level P , 0.05 of IA2As also was observed in responders compared with nonresponders , as shown in Fig. 3C , whereas there were no differences for mean GADAs and ZnT8As between the two groups Fig. 3B and D . At and beyond 12 months , when insulin antibodies were increasing , there was no correlation between IAA levels and C-peptide . DISCUSSION Type 1A , or autoimmune , diabetes is characterized by the presence of a series of autoantibodies targeting islet mol-ecules , including insulin , GAD65 , IA-2 , and ZnT8 15 . The initial assay for islet autoantibodies measured cytoplasmic islet cell autoantibodies by indirect immunofluorescence , using frozen sections of human pancreata 16 . IAAs are not detected with the islet cell antibody assay , whereas GADAs , IA2As , and ZnT8As can be detected . In addition to the autoantibodies , which were present before the di-agnosis of diabetes , almost all patients treated with insulin including patients with type 2 diabetes developed high levels relative to levels of prediabetic and new-onset patients of insulin antibodies 17 . Islet autoantibodies have a number of distinguishing characteristics . IAAs often are but not always the first autoantibody to appear in children followed from birth 18 , and at onset of diabetes , their levels are inversely related to age of diabetes onset 19,20 . GADAs change the least with age of onset . ZnT8As are rapidly lost after diabetes onset 21 , and IA2As are very specific , identifying a particularly high diabetes risk of prospectively followed nondiabetic children 22 . The mol-ecules insulin and ZnT8 are , to a large extent , limited to islet cells , whereas GAD65 and IA-2 are distributed in multiple neuroendocrine tissues . Given these unique properties for each of the islet autoantibodies , it is perhaps not surprising that rituximab had a differential effect upon the measured antibodies , with the most dramatic suppression of insulin autoantibodies and antibodies . Rituximab treatment has been reported to blunt primary and secondary antibody responses 23,24 . Because patients who entered into this study were treated with insulin prior to determination of IAAs , it is not possible to isolate the effect of rituximab on pre-existing IAAs versus prevention and suppression of insulin antibodies induced by subcuta-neous insulin therapy . This highlights the need for stan-dardized assays that would distinguish the two types of antibodies . This may be particularly important given recent findings indicating that levels of IAAs , but not GADAs , and IA2As are inversely correlated with the rate at which pre-diabetic children progress to diabetes 25 . A number of studies have documented the differential effects of anti-CD20 treatment on different antibodies in both humans and animal models . In general , rituximab therapy does not suppress overall IgG compared with its effect on IgM antibodies 12 . IgG levels can remain un-altered , whereas specific pathogenic autoantibodies are markedly suppressed . Specific disease-associated auto-antibodies that are produced in sites outside of the bone marrow may be more susceptible to anti-CD20 suppres-sion , and this may relate to the differential effect in the current study upon IAAs 5 . There is a large body of ev-idence in the NOD mouse model that insulin may be a primary autoantigen 26,27 . In particular , mutating an antigenic insulin peptide prevents diabetes in NOD mice 27 , whereas knockouts of both GAD65 and IA-2 do not influence progression to diabetes 28,29 . In addition , a polymorphism of the insulin gene correlated with increased levels of thymic insulin message is associated with de-creased type 1A diabetes risk 30–32 . Rituximab is remarkably effective in blocking de novo antibody responses and may be able to suppress both IAAs and insulin antibodies the latter induced by injections of human insulin . In particular , 40 % of patients treated with rituximab in the trial became negative for variable times for insulin antibodies IAAs . Studies prior to , or within several weeks of , insulin therapy , given current insulin autoantibody antibody assays , are needed to define whether rituximab can specifically suppress IAAs . A significantly lower level of IAAs was observed , in-dependent of rituximab treatment , in subjects defined as C-peptide responders versus nonresponders , particularly evident even in the placebo group . IA2As at entry also were found to be significantly lower although not as dramatic a difference compared with IAAs at entry in the placebo group for responders versus nonresponders , whereas no difference was observed for either GADAs or ZnT8As . The levels of IAAs were remarkably lower in responders compared with nonresponders at time 0 for both rituximab-and placebo-injection groups , which may indicate that the levels of IAAs , independent of rituximab treatment , are likely to be associated with disease prog-nosis or disease progression in patients with newly di-agnosed type 1A diabetes . The relationship between the levels of IAAs and disease progression only has been in-vestigated in the prediabetic period with the presence of anti-islet autoantibodies , but this has not been possible to study after disease onset . Among these biochemically de-fined islet autoantibodies , IAAs are the only ones in which the level is associated with the time to develop clinical type 1A diabetes among multiple autoantibody-positive prediabetic subjects all followed to diabetes in the Di-abetes Autoimmunity Study in the Young DAISY study 33 . Higher IAA levels are associated with faster pro-gression to overt diabetes . Combining this previous study with the present observation , IAA level seems to play a role in the prediction of disease progression , and higher levels of IAAs might indicate more aggressive autoimmune destruction of pancreatic b-cells both before and after clinical onset of diabetes . The IAAs in the current study are presumably a mixed population of naturally occurring IAAs and induced insulin antibodies . It needs to be further explored whether only IAAs or both IAAs and insulin antibodies secondary to injected insulin are associated with disease progression and the potentially therapeutic effect of rituximab .

21835306	Introduction Marker-set analysis refers to the joint evaluation of a group of markers for genetic association . These markers might be of various polymorphism types e.g. , a mixture of SNP , insertion-deletion variants [ INDEL ] , block substitutions , copy-number variants , or inversion variants but share certain common genomic features , such as participating in the same pathway , being in high linkage disequilibrium LD , or being located within the same gene or conserved functional region . Marker-set analysis has drawn great attention in recent genome-wide and sequence-based associationstudies.Itassessesthejointassociationofpoten-tially correlated and interacting loci . It amplifies the detect-abilityofthecausalsignalsbyaggregatingsmalleffectsfrom multiple individual loci . Furthermore , because sequences and functions of genes are highly consistent across popula-tions and species , a marker-set analysis increases the inter-pretability and replicability of the association findings . For whole-genome scans , it also offers a naturalway of reducing the total number of tests and hence improves power by reducing the multiple-testing burden . For sequence-based studies , marker-setanalysisaccumulatesinformationacross multiple rare mutations and has a greatly enhanced power to detect rare variants that are hard for researchers to identify by traditional analysis methods . A variety of methods are available for detecting marker-set association , ranging from minimum p value or Fisher’s combined methods1,2 for single-marker tests to multi-marker tests with a genotype-or haplotype-based scoring . Many recent methods fall in between the two extremes . These methods collapse information from all markers in the set and achieve a better balance between information and degrees of freedom . Depending on how the individual marker information is combined , we can roughly classify these approaches into four categories . Methods in the first category use the weighted sum of genotypes across markers , for example the LD-based weighting method , 3 the weighted Fourier transform , 4 and the PCA-based methods.5,6 Recently , special versions of the weighted-sum methods based on allele frequencies were proposed to target rare variants.7–10 Methods of the second type model the genetic similarity of pairs of individuals and are also referred to as U-statistics approaches.11–19 Methods of the third type are variance-component VC methods , which treat individual genetic effects as random effects and test for the corresponding VC to detect the global effect of a gene . Methods of this type include the SNP random-effects model , 20,21 haplotype random-effects model , 22 and kernel-based methods.23–25 The fourth category includes other approaches that do not fit into the above categories , such as the c-alpha test , 26 the group additive regression model , 27 Tukey’s model , 28 and entropy-based methods.29 Although most marker-set methods have concentrated on detecting genetic main effects , here we focus on methods for studying gene-environment G 3 E interactions . Identifying genetic variants with heteroge-neous effects under different environmental exposures is crucial for understanding individualized medicine , studying pharmacogenetics , characterizing underlying biological mechanisms , and uncovering unexplained heritability.30,31 Marker-set analysis provides an ideal framework for the study of G 3 E interactions . The marker set , either defined by genes , pathways , or functions , provides a biologically sensible unit for the G component , and the loci in a set can be assessed jointly for whether their effects are modified under different environmental exposures . In addition , the potential power gain brought by the marker-set analysis—either through aggregating genetic signals or by reducing multiple-testing penalty— can alleviate the data-hungry nature of detecting G 3 E interactions . Typically , a G 3 E test would require sample sizes at least four times larger than a main effect test for detecting an effect of comparable magnitude.30–33 Further-more , many G 3 E studies are based on conceptual models for candidate pathways , in which a set of genes are selected and studied together.31,34 Marker-set analysis offers a suit-able tool for the evaluation of the overall effect of the postu-lated pathways when assessing G 3 E interactions . The marker-set G 3 E method we present focuses on quantitative traits and uses pairwise genetic similarity as a tool to aggregate marker information i.e. , the second category in the above method categorization . Our approach differs from those in the literature on gene pathway level analysis in the following aspects . First , we introduce a framework for incorporating interaction effects in similarity-based methods . To be useful for G 3 E studies with either confirmatory or exploratory aims , we develop a series of tests to suit different purposes , including a test for detecting G 3 E interactions , a test for detecting marginal main effects , and a joint test for detecting the overall association induced either by genetic main effects or by G 3 E interactions . The joint test serves as a good tool when little is known a priori about the genetic hetero-geneity across exposure strata and provides power across a wide range of the unknown underlying true structures . Second , the proposed method can collapse information from a mixture of different types of variants and is designed to detect common and uncommon variants . Both are desir-able features when more classes of DNA variants are avail-able . Finally , we illustrate how similarity-based collapsing methods can be equivalent to VC methods i.e. , category 3 in the method categorization , which are found to have better main-effect performance than several other marker-set approaches.24,35–37 Through simulation , we show the validity of the test and investigate the power of the pro-posed approach under a wide range of scenarios . We illus-trate the utility of the proposed method by using the samples from the Vitamin Intervention for Stroke Preven-tion VISP trial . In this study , candidate genes across the genome were selected for the evaluation of the gene and gene-age interaction effects on the change in fasting homo-cysteine Hcy level following a 2 hr methionine load test .

The LD pattern was summarized with the average of the 16 R2 values , where each value is the LD between an observed marker eight in total and a risk locus two in total . A larger LD value reflects stronger correlation between the observed markers and 0.05 12 ? ? 8 + + 2 + 2 + + + 2 0 + + + + 2 + 2 + + 2 + 2 2 + + + 2 4 H M L H M L H M L H M L H M L H M Rate | | | | | | q 0.1 q 0.3 q 0.1 q 0.3 q 0.1 q 0.3 1 4 0 Type H M L H M L H M L H M L H M L H M | | | | | q 0.1 q 0.3 q 0.1 q 0.3 q 0.1 q the unobserved risk loci , hence the value reflects the informativeness of the observed markers for the risk loci . Each of the type I error rates was calculated on the basis of 50,000 replications for ? gG1 gG2 gGE1 gGE2 ? ? ? 0 0 0 0 ? for all tests and 20,000 replications for ? 0 2 0 2 0 0 ? for G 3 E test . The results Figure 1 indicate that the type I error rates were around the nominal levels considered i.e. , a ? 0 05 , 0 005 , and 0 0005 for all methods in most scenarios . The exceptions tend to occur in the haplotype G 3 E tests , where the type I errors can be inflated because of the presence of rare haplotypes . Inflation at larger a levels can often be eliminated by using a slightly higher threshold e.g. , 0.02 , as opposed to the default value of 0.01 that pools uncommon haplo-types into the baseline group . To avoid any potential impact that modifying the default threshold might induce , we still used the threshold value of 0.01 in our power analysis . The power was evaluated for each of the 1734 regions on the basis of 100 replications at the nominal level of 0.0005 . The results are shown in Figure 2 G 3 E test , Figure 3 G test , and Figure 4 joint test . The 1734 regions were grouped into 12 categories , combinations of the four scenarios of allele frequencies and the three LD patterns . The risk allele frequencies from rare to common are catego-rized as follows A both allele frequencies are less than 0.05 , B sums of allele frequencies that are less than 0.3 but excluding those in A , C sums of allele frequencies that are between 0.3 and 0.6 , and D sums of allele frequencies that are greater than 0.6 . The clustering of LD patterns is based on the following thresholds an average R2 0 6 for high , an average R2 ? ? 0 25 0 6 ? for medium , and an average R2 0 25 for low .

A similar pattern was observed across Figures 2–4 , hence we concentrate on explaining Figure 2 . In regions that exhibit low LD LD-L , all three methods lacked power and had roughly equal performance . The exception is in A , where the SIM1 method performed worse than the other two . The situation that all three methods had similarly low power is not surprising because LD-L represents regions that contained markers with little information about the two risk loci . The lone exception in LD-L A can be ex-plained by the fact that the SIM1 method is best applied in scenarios where a large number of markers have at least medium-level LD with the risk loci , but in LD-L A , such a scenario only occurred in 13 % of the regions . On the other hand , in 60 % of the regions , the majority of the markers had no LD with the risk loci , but either one single marker was in perfect LD with one of the risk loci , or two markers were in very high LD with each of the risk loci . The former cases tend to favor the SNP methods , whereas the latter tend to favor the HAP methods and the remaining 27 % were regions where all markers had extremely low LD with the risk loci . In the scenarios of LD-L with B , C , and D , we did not observe such a large proportion of extreme cases , and this resulted in a more comparable performance of the three methods . Finally , compared to regions with LD-L , in the regions with medium LD LD-M , we observed a uniform increase of power in all three methods , and SIM1 has a slightly greater power . The power gain was more pronounced for high-LD regions LD-H , where SIM1 showed more power than the other two methods . To understand the impact of different weighting schemes in the similarity regression , we repeated the same analysis with SIM1 , SIM2 , and SIM0 Figure 5 . Because the overall patterns were similar across different tests , we present the results from the G 3 E and G tests. Figure 5 presents the box plots of power for the same regions as shown previously , except that panels C and D in Figures 2–4 were grouped together to represent common-variant scenarios . We also marked the corre-sponding average power of SNP solid line and HAP dotted line for comparison . We observed the following features 1 SIM0 and SIM2 had very similar power in almost all situations 2 when risk alleles are common i.e. , [ C ] and [ F ] , SIM2 and SIM0 had similar or slightly better power than SIM1 , although the difference was not very obvious and 3 when the risk alleles are uncommon or rare , SIM1 started to gain some traction in improving power . The power improvement became more substantial for rarer alleles . For example , in situations with a moderate LD level , SIM1 had higher power than SNP and HAP , whereas SIM2 and SIM0 did not . Application to Real Data We applied the similarity regression on samples collected from the VISP trial . VISP was a multicenter , double-blind , randomized , controlled clinical trial that aimed to study the effect of vitamins on preventing recurrent stroke . The VISP trial was conducted under institutional review board approval at the Wake Forest University School of Medicine and at each of the clinic sites and adhered to the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki . Written informed consent was obtained from all patients participating in the study . The trial enrolled patients who were 35 or older with a nondis-abling cerebral infarction [ MIM 601367 ] within 120 days of randomization and Hcy levels in the top quartile for the U.S. population . Subjects were randomly assigned to receive daily doses of either a high-dose formulation con-taining 25 mg vitamin B6 , 0.4 mg vitamin B12 , and 2.5 mg folic acid or a low-dose formulation containing 200 mg vitamin B6 , 6 mg vitamin B12 , and 20 mg folic acid . The patients were followed up for a maximum of 2 years , and the average follow-up time was 1.7 years . About 2100 of the VISP participants provided DNA samples , and geno-type information was collected from candidate genes selected across the genome that are involved in homocys-teine metabolism , stroke risk , and atherosclerosis [ MIM 209010 ] . After quality control , the dataset consists of 1944 subjects and genotypes of 1393 SNPs collected from 215 candidate genes . More details on the VISP trial and VISP genetic study can be found in Toole et al.48 and Hsu et al. , 49 respectively . Our analysis here focused on the genetic influence on the Hcy level obtained from a 2 hr methionine load test measured at baseline . It has been suggested that Hcy level can be used to predict risk of recurrent stroke and symp-tomatic coronary heart disease , and genetic variations might be attributed to mild to moderate hyperhomocysti-nemia [ MIM 603174 ] . Given that the Hcy level tends to increase with age , we also investigated the potential gene-age interaction effects on Hcy . We conducted gene-based analyses we used the proposed SIM1 method to assess the significant level of each gene and compared it to the available benchmark , SNP , and or HAP methods . As in the original study , 49 we adjusted for age , sex , and race in each analysis . The Bonferroni threshold for p value is 0 05 215 ? 2 33310 4 Wefirstusedthejoint testtoperformagene-basedscanto evaluate the gene and gene-age effects on the change in postmethionine load Hcy level i.e. , postmethionine load test Hcy baseline fasting Hcy . If a gene is rejected by a joint test , the G 3 E and G tests can be used to further refine the sources of identified signals . The joint test is a suitable screening tool for scenarios in which the under-lying gene-age interaction mechanism is little known32,41 because it assesses the genetic main effect and gene-age interactions simultaneously . The p values of the testing results for each gene sorted by gene names are shown in Figure 6 . For joint tests , one gene was found to be significant CBS [ MIM 613381 ] , and both SIM1 and SNP tests yield significant p values . The p value of the SIM1 joint is 2 46310 5 , and the follow-up analysis reveals that the signal is caused by the genetic main effect instead of gene - age interactions the p value of SIM G 3 E is 0 614 , and the p value of SIM G is 1 99310 6 . The SNP joint test has the adjusted minimum p value adjusted for the 10 typed SNPs in CBS of 2 06310 5 . The adjusted minimum p value is obtained by 1 ? 1 raw p value ? ke f f where ke ? 7 59 f f is the effective number of independent tests estimated with the method of Moskvina and Schmidt45 after accounting for the LD in CBS . The adjusted minimum p value for the SNP G 3 E test is 0.700 , and for SNP G test it is 9 42310 6 . Finally , the HAP G 3 E test yielded a p value of 0 362 , and HAP G test yielded a significant p value of 1 02310 5.Variantsin CBS havepreviouslybeenassociated with postmethionine load Hcy levels and change in Hcy levels.49–52 A common 68 bp insertion at the intron 7-exon 8 boundary of CBS and the 31 bp variable number of tandem repeats VNTR might be genetic determinants of postmethionine load Hcy levels . Because postmethio-nine load Hcy levels are found to have an increased risk for cardiovascular disease , CBS could be also considered a risk factor for cardiovascular disease . Discussion Association analyses at the gene , pathway , and exon levels here by marker-set analysis hold great promise in power LD-M evaluating modest etiological effects of genes with data from genome-wide association studies GWAS or next-generation sequencing . However , currently available methods tend to target either rare or common variants but not both , assume same-direction effects for loci within a marker set , use a testing framework that can not accom-modate covariates , or do not have the capacity to assess interaction effects . In this article , we propose a flexible , powerful and computationally efficient method to con-duct marker-set analysis for assessing gene and gene-environment interactions on quantitative traits . The pro-posed method is constructed via a similarity regression framework under which we regress trait similarity on genetic similarity . The framework incorporates interaction effects , can adjust for covariates , and is applicable to both observed and imputed dosage genotypes . We develop a series of statistical tests that can be used for genetic marginal main effects , G 3 E interactions , or the joint effect of the two . We demonstrated that a similarity regres-sion is equivalent to a haplotype random-effects model . The equivalence enabled us to analytically derive the asymptotic distributions of the test statistics and provide a permutation-free procedure to assess significance . The LD-L . software implementing the proposed methods is available at the authors’ website see Web Resources . The proposed method uses genetic similarity to aggre-gate information across markers and integrates adaptive weights dependent on allele frequencies to accommodate common and uncommon variants . Collapsing informa-tion at the similarity level instead of the genotype level avoids canceling signals with opposite etiological effects and is applicable to any class of genetic variants without having to dichotomize the allele types . As demonstrated in the simulation , incorporating frequency weights gives the method satisfactory power for detecting both common and uncommon variants . The simulation results also reveal that its performance is sensitive to the signal-to-noise ratio e.g. , LD among all loci included in the marker-set analysis . The higher the ratio is , the greater the power gain for the proposed methods . As discussed in the next paragraph , it is possible to increase the signal-to-noise ratio to maximize the chance of power gain , such as by using functional , biological or LD informa-tion to downweight the contribution from noise markers . In practice , the underlying LD levels are not known and will vary from regions to regions , it is less likely to choose one best performing method in advance . In addition , in GWAS , the low-LD scenario would occur less frequently by design , and in sequencing studies the number of risk loci in a set should be higher than what we considered in the simulation . Given these considerations , the proposed method can serve as a sensible and robust tool for evaluating association of complex traits in whole-genome marker-set analyses . The inclusion of nonfunctional loci i.e. , nonrisk markers that are not in LD with the risk loci is a major factor influencing the performance of all marker-set approaches . Intelligently incorporating LD information and biological knowledge into the collapsing process , and downweighting the contribution of nonfunctional markers will be a useful solution . In our framework , bio-logical and functional information , as pioneered and comprehensively reviewed in Price et al.10 and Schaid38 can be naturally incorporated through the weight matrix , Wm One unique feature of our weighting framework is that it allows functional weights at the allele-specific level as opposed to locus-specific level , such as the impact of a specific mutation sequence on protein func-tions , structures , or stability . We are exploring mecha-nisms to include genomic knowledge on the basis of functionality , biological pathways , and system biological networks . One key requirement for the proposed method to have power for both common and uncommon variants is that the similarity level be weighted by allele frequency at order k i.e. , q k . Although the principle is to upweight similarities that are contributed by rare variants , there are no clear rules for what the specific form of the weights should be as a function of the allele frequencies . Kwee et al.23 considered both k ? 1 and k ? 1 2 when calcu-lating the IBS kernel and concluded that the former might be too strong and the latter is more suitable in their setting . Wu et al.24 therefore used k ? 1 2 in their work . When aggregating information of multiple loci through weighted genotype sum , Madsen and Browning8 consid-ered their weights in the order of k ? 1 2 from the bino-mial standard deviation SD viewpoint . Here , we evalu-ated these different choices of k under our framework ? Gene ID i.e. , SIM1 ? k ? 1 ? SIM2 ? k ? 1 2 ? , and SIM0 ? k ? 0 ? . We found that SIM2 might be too mild and tends to yield similar results as the unweighted SIM0 . One main differ-ence between our weighting framework and others is that we assign weights for every allele , whereas others only assign weights for minor alleles . To illustrate the impact of the difference , consider the similarity score between a heterozygous pair . Our weights yield a score of qminor 1 2 ? qmajor , 1 2 whereas those weights placed only on minor alleles yield a bigger score of qminor32 1 2 and give a stronger weighting effect . Simulation results also suggest that larger values of k can greatly boost power for detecting rare variants , but it also risks losing power when the risk variant is common . We focused on SIM1 on the basis of its superior power for rare variants and comparable power for common variants . It is possible that the optimal weights would lie some-where between k ? 1 and k ? 1 2 , and we are investigating further how to identify an optimal order . Alternatively , one can use centered genotype scoring to account for sharing of rarer alleles.53 To center the allele count vector Gm i , we define Gm ? Gm Gm , where Gm is the vector i i of population allele frequency for marker m . Then the similarity score Sij is obtained by 1 M3 Gm Gm . m ? 1 i j The centering strategy bypasses the need of allele-frequency-dependent weights and hence avoids the choice of an order k . Studies to understand the pros and cons of centering versus weighting strategies are underway . Appendix A Expectation-Maximization Algorithm for the REML Estimates of t and s When Testing for G 3 E H0 f ? 0 Let u ? KT Y be a set of n d linearly independent contrasts of Y with KKT ? I X ? XT X ? 1XT and KT K ? In3n . Then the conditional distribution of u given b de-noted by f ? uj b ? , is normal with mean KT Hb and variance sI and does not depend on the fixed effect g Therefore , the REML estimations of t and s can be based on its R marginal distribution f ? u ? ? f ? uj b ? f ? b ? db This moti - vated an expectation-maximization algorithm based on observed data u and missing data b . The complete-data log likelihood is given by In the expectation step E-step , we compute Q ? t s b ? t ? b ? t ? ? , t s the conditional expected value of log f ? u b t s ? ? b ? t ? b ? t ? ? , given the observed data u assuming ? t s ? ? t s b ? t ? b ? t ? where t and s are the estimates at the tth iteration . b ? t ? b ? t ? b ? t ? b ? t ?

The conditional moments of b given u are obtained directly from the normality of the joint distribution of ? u b ? The calculation of the project matrix P1 requires inverting the n3n nonsparse matrix V1 which can be computational burdensome . To speed up the computation , we rewrite where S ? ELET , the eigenvalue decomposition of matrix S. Then by the fact that ? I ? B1B2 ? 1 ? I B1 ? I ? B2B1 ? 1B2 , we can rewrite V1 1 ? 1 sfI t sEL ? I ? ET t sEL ? 1ET g ? 1 sfI tEL ? sI ? tET EL ? 1ET g in which the calculation involves only an inversion of an L3L matrix . Appendix B Derivation of the Score Test Statistics and Their Asymptotic Distribution For quantitative traits that follow a normal distribution directly or after appropriate transformations , model Equa-tion 2 reduces to the following linear mixed model LMM in matrix notation where YT ? ? Y1 Yn ? 1 is an n31 vector of 1s , XT ? ? X1 Xn ? D ? diagfXig , and ? n31 T ? ? e1 en ? Because our primary interest is to test the variance components f and t , we consider the restricted maximum likelihood REML log-likelihood function of variance compo-nents ? t f s ? [ REML ? t f Y ? ? flogjVj ? logjXT V 1Xj ? YT PYg 2 where V is the marginal variance of Y and V ? fS ? tS ? sI , where S ? HRHT and S ? DSD P ? V 1 V 1X ? XT V 1X ? 1XT V 1 is the projection matrix for the LMM 4 . Let Uf ? f t s ? and Ut ? f t s ? denote the score functions based on the REML function for f and t respectively . Simple algebra54 shows that under H0 f ? 0 Uf 0 b t b ? and under H0 t ? 0 and with the constrain of f ? 0 , Ut 0 0 s ? In the above equations , ? ~ t s ~ ? are the REML estimates of ? t s ? under H0 f ? 0 as given in Appendix A , and ~ the REML estimate of s when t ? f ? 0 . Recall that Pt ? Vt 1 Vt 1X ? XT Vt 1X ? 1XT Vt 1 where t ? f0 1g and V1 ? tS ? sI and V0 ? sI . As shown in Tzeng and Zhang , 22 the score statistics under H0 arenot asymptotically normalbecause thedesignmatrix H for the random effects b is not block diagonal and the dimension of b is fixed . We thus use the first terms of the score statistics as the testing statistics and obtain TG3E ? YT P1SP1Y 2 and TG ? YT P0SP0Y 2 Below we derive the asymptotic null distribution of TG3E and similar steps can be used to obtain the distribution for TG If m ? 1g0 Xg and Z ? V1 1 2 ? Y m ? , then Z follows a stan-dard multivariate normal distribution . We rewrite TG3E ? ZT ? 1 2V1 1 2 P1SP1V1 1 2 ? ZhZT CG3EZ , which is true because mT P1 ? 0 bythefact of P1 being aprojectionmatrix . Define ei and hi , the eigenvector and eigenvalue of matrix Pc Z ? 2hPiL ? 1hi CG3E , respectively . Then TG3E ? i ? 1hi ? eiT ~2 Z ~2 i with Z follows a 1 degree-of-freedom chi-square distribu-i tion . In reality , ? t s ? is evaluated at their restricted maximum likelihood estimates ? b t s b ? . Following Tzeng and Zhang , 22 the distribution of TG3E can be approximated Pc by the distribution of b ici21 , where b i’s are the nonzero i ? 1 eigenvalues of matrix CG3Ej ? b ? b . The distribution of t t s s TG3E can be approximated by the three-moment approxi - mation method of.43 The level-a significance threshold is p ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? P estimated by k1 ? ? ca h0 ? 3 k2 h0 , where kj ? hij h0 ? i k2 3 k3 2 and ca is the a th quantile of ch0 2 i.e. , chi-square distribution with h0 degrees of freedom . Alternatively , one can report the p value of the observed statistic TG3E p ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? by P ch0 2 c , where c ? ? TG3E k1 ? 3 h0 k2 ? h0 . By the same manner , the distribution of TG can also be approximated by the three-moment approximation as above , except that the eigenvalues his are obtained from matrix CG ? 1 2V0 1 2 P0SP0V0 1 2 j s ? ~ . s Null Distribution of the Score Statistics for Joint Test The test statistic for the joint hypothesis H0 f ? t ? 0 is Tjoint ? TG ? ? TG0 ? P , where TG is defined as before and 3E TG0 ? E ? ? 1 2YT P0 P0Y , i.e. , TG3E evaluated at f ? t ? 0 3 and s ? ~ A direct unweighted sum is used here because X has been prestandardized to mean ? 0 and variance ? 1 , and hence TG and TG3E are on the same scale . We found that the performance of the unweighted sum is very similar to that of the weighted sum , Tjoint wt ? wG3TG ? wG3E3TG0 ? E , ? where the weights wi ? E ? Ti ? var ? Ti ? . By 3 a similar derivation as in the G 3 E test , it can be shown that the null distribution of Tjoint also has a weighted chi-square distribution and can be approximated by the three-moment approximation . The procedure is the same as what mentioned for the G 3 E test , except that the eigenvalues should be obtained from the matrix Cjoint ? 1 1 2 P0 ? S ? 1 2 2V0 S ? P0V0 j ~ .

21835308	Hereditary ataxias are genetically heterogeneous neurolog-ical disorders autosomal-dominant , autosomal-recessive , X-linked , and mitochondrial types are known . Among ataxias , spinocerebellar ataxia SCA is relatively common and involves the cerebellum , brainstem , or spinocerebellar longtracts.1 Autosomal-recessivecerebellarataxias ARCAs are generally associated with diverse neurological and non-neurological attributes , resulting in complex phenotypes . ARCAs include congenital nonprogressive ataxias and progressive ataxias such as SCAs.2 The clinical onset of ARCAs usually occurs before the age of 20 , even if congen-ital types are excluded.1,3,4 Currently , more than 20 defec-tive genes have been identified in ARCAs.2,5,6 These genes have variable recognized functions , including those in-volving mitochondrial energy generation , cellular metabo-lisms , DNA repair , chaperone-mediated protein folding , RNA processing , and ion channels.1,3,6 Approximately half of the patients with ARCAs remain genetically un-resolved.4 Therefore , more investigations of ARCAs are required . In this study , we describe a Japanese family with two siblings showing psychomotor retardation and the slowly progressive type of SCA without involvement of pyramidal tracts or peripheral nerves . Exome sequencing combined with homozygosity mapping successfully identi-fied a causative mutation . Clinical information and blood materials were obtained from the family members after written informed consent was secured . Experimental protocols were approved by IRBs of the Yokohama City University and the Shinshu University . Among the children of first-cousin parents , two siblings IV-3 and IV-4 were found to be affected , whereas the other two IV-1 and IV-2 were healthy Figure 1A . No similar patients were recognized within the family . IV-3 had mild psychomotor retardation from childhood . He found a job after graduating from an ordi-nary junior high school . At 35 years of age , he lost his job for social reasons . Although he had some gait distur-bances from childhood , he could independently go shopping and walk a dog even after leaving his occupa-tion . At the age of ~56 , he developed obvious gait unstead-iness and began to stumble frequently . At 58 , he started to choke on food . These symptoms gradually worsened , and he sought medical examination at 59 years of age . He displayed disturbances of smooth-pursuit eye move-ments , dysarthria , mild limb ataxia , and moderate truncal ataxia . His muscle tone was normal , and no involuntary movements were observed . Laboratory examination , in-cluding analysis of serum albumin , vitamin E , and a-feto-protein , was normal . A nerve-conduction study NCS indicated no neuropathy . No retinitis pigmentosa was recognized by ophthalmologic evaluation . Brain magnetic resonance imaging MRI revealed mild atrophy of the cerebellar vermis and hemispheres but no apparent atrophy of the brain stem or the cerebral cortex . Figure 1B , left panels . Similar to IV-3 , IV-4 also had psychomotor retardation from childhood , but this retardation was more severe than that of IV-3 . After graduation from a school for disabled children at the age of 15 , he entered a facility for disabled people . He showed gait disorder , but he was able to walk without a cane . At an age of ~50 , his gait disturbance worsened , and he went for a medical check at a hospital when he was 56 years old . He displayed distur-bance of smooth-pursuit eye movements , gaze-evoked horizontal nystagmus , dysarthria , mild limb ataxia , and moderate truncal ataxia . No involuntary movements were observed . His laboratory tests , including those for serum albumin , vitamin E , and a-fetoprotein , were normal . NCS was normal . A brain MRI was similar to that of IV-3 Figure 1B , right panels . The clinical manifes-tations of these two patients are summarized in Table 1 . To search for the disease locus , we conducted genome-wide SNP genotyping of III-1 , IV-1 , IV-2 , IV-3 , and IV-4 by using the Genome-wide Human SNP Array 6.0 SNP 6.0 array Affymetrix , Inc. , Santa Clara , CA according to the manufacturer’s instructions . Then , SNP 6.0 array data were subjected to homozygosity mapping with HomozygosityMapper software.7 For the linkage analysis , a subset of 7339 SNPs with high heterozygosity mean heterozy-gosity 0.49 was extracted from the SNP 6.0 array data with the program Linkdata-gen , for which the bin size was set to 0.5cM and the allele frequency of the Japa-nese population was used.8 The multipoint LOD score was calculated with Allegro version 29 on the basis of the model of autosomal-recessive and X-linked-recessive inheritance , respectively . In both models , com-plete penetrance and a disease-allele frequency of 0.0001 were adopted . The homozygosity mapping revealed a total of three regions , which together were approximately 11.35 Mb in size , as candidate loci , where genes known to be mutated in ARCA did not exist Table 2 . In the model of autosomal-recessive inheritance , a total of ten regions with a LOD score greater than 1.5 in the multipoint linkage analysis were identified Table S1 . The three homozygous regions in accordance with the linked regions still survived as candidate regions . On the basis of X-linked recessive inheritance , a total of three regions with positive LOD scores maximum LOD score ? 0.9031 were high-lighted together , these three regions were approximately 101.03 Mb Table S1 . To find a gene mutation within the candidate loci , we performed whole-exome sequencing on IV-3 and IV-4 . Three micrograms of genomic DNA was processed with the SureSelect Human All Exon Kit v.1 approximately 180,000 exons covering 38 Mb of the CCDS database Agilent Technologies , Santa Clara , CA according to the manufacturer’s instructions . Captured DNAs were se-quenced on an Illumina GAIIx Illumina , San Diego , CA with 76 bp pair-end reads . Of the possible eight lanes of the flow cell , two lanes for IV-3 and three lanes for IV-4 Illumina were used .

Reads were aligned to the human reference genome sequence UCSC hg18 , NCBI build 36.1 via the ELAND v2 program Illumina . Coverage was calculated statistically with a script created by BITS Tokyo , Japan . Approxi-mately 71 million reads from IV-3 and 148 million reads from IV-4 these numbers of reads passed quality-control [ Path Filter ] were mapped to the human reference genome with Mapping and Assembly with Qualities MAQ 10 and NextGENe software v2.00 SoftGenetics , State College , PA under the default settings . MAQ aligned 59,491,138 and 126,159,746 reads to the whole genome for IV-3 and IV-4 , respectively . A script created by BITS was used for extraction of SNPs and indels from the alignment data dbSNP build 130 served as a reference for registered SNPs . A consensus quality score of 40 or more was adopted for the SNP analysis in MAQ . Coverage analysis revealed that 65.0 % IV-3 and 71.3 % IV-4 of the coding sequences CDS were completely covered 100 % , and 77.7 % IV-3 and 80.3 % IV-4 of CDS were mostly covered by reads 90 % or more through the whole genome . 79.0 % IV-3 Chromosome Chromosomal Position rsID Size Mb LOD 1 207226930 rs2761781 – 6.77 2.0537 213992561 rs1857229 4 181929079 rs918401 – 3.26 2.0554 185188999 rs7690914 22 45676443 rs3905396 – 1.33 2.0545 47003473 rs2013591 Regions of homozygosity were identified by HomozygosityMapper , and the LOD scores were calculated by multipoint linkage analysis , for which SNPs were extracted from SNP 6.0 array data via Linkdatagen . and 79.7 % IV-4 of total CDS were covered by ten reads or more 50 reads or more in 66.4 % and 77.1 % , respec-tively . To identify the pathogenic mutation , we adopted a prioritization scheme , which has been used in recent studies.11–13 First , we excluded the variants registered in dbSNP130 from all the detected variants and then picked up homozygous mutations and variants in coding regions and the intronic regions within 50 bp from coding sequences . Of the homozygous mutations and variants , we focused on those within the candidate regions . As a result , only two missense mutations or variants , p.Gly484Asp c.1451G A NM_001146261.1 in exon 8 of SYT14 1q32.2 , [ MIM 610949 ] and p.Gln4203Arg c.12608A G NM_206933.2 in exon 63 of USH2A 1q41 , [ MIM 608400 ] remained as candidates for both cases Table S2 . Sanger sequencing with ABI 3500xL Life Technologies , Carlsbad , CA confirmed that the c.1451G A of SYT14 was homozygous in IV-3 and IV-4 and heterozygous in III-1 father , IV-1 , and IV-2 , whereas the c.12608A G of USH2A was homozygous in IV-2 as well as IV-3 and IV-4 Figure 1C and data not shown . The SYT14 missense mutation occurred at an evolution-arily conserved amino acid among different species and resides in the second C2 C2B domain Figures 1D and 1E . In silico analysis incorporating different tools , including Polyphen , Polyphen2 , SIFT , and Align GVGD , consistently indicated that the change was damaging Table S3 . The mutation was not detected in 576 Japanese control chromosomes , indicating that the mutation is very rare . On the basis of the X-linked recessive model , no path-ological hemizygous mutation of protein-coding genes was detected in the possible candidate loci Table S4 . We considered the SYT14 mutation to be the causative agent and used the Sanger method to conduct mutation screening of all the coding regions of SYT14 in 65 simplex SCA cases and 37 SCA familial cases , including three with autosomal-recessive inheritance . Only p.Gly183Glu c.548G A was found in one family with autosomal-dominant SCA however , the change was not consistent with the SCA phenotype in the family Table S3 . Thus , we could not detect any other pathological changes in SYT14 . This was probably due to the small number of cases tested . Synaptotagmin XIV SYT14 , which is encoded by SYT14 , is a member of the synaptotagmins SYTs , which are membrane-trafficking proteins , and SYT14 is conserved across many organisms.14 Although the original report indicated that SYT14 was not expressed in mouse brain , 14 multiple lines of evidence , including from the Allen brain Atlas , suggest that SYT14 is expressed in the central nervous system CNS of the fly , mouse , and human brains.15,16 To confirm SYT14 expression in the CNS , we performed TaqMan quantitative real-time PCR analysis with cDNAs of adult human tissue Human MTC Panel I , # 636742 Clontech Laboratories , Mountain View , CA , fetal human tissue Human Fetal MTC Panel , # 636747 Clontech Laboratories , mouse tissue Mouse MTC Panel I , # 636745 Clontech Laboratories , and various regions of the mouse brain GSMBRSET NIPPON Genetics , Tokyo , Japan as templates . Predesigned TaqMan probe sets for human SYT14 Hs00950169_m1 , mouse Syt14 Mm00805319_m1 , human b-actin ACTB , 4326315E , and mouse Actb 43522341E from Applied Biosystems were used . PCR reactions total volume of 20 ml contained 10 ml of the TaqMan Gene Expression Master Mix Applied Biosystems , 1 ml of 20 3 TaqMan reagents for ACTB Actb and SYT14 Syt14 , and 1 ml of cDNA containing 1 ng cDNA in MTC panels and 25 ng cDNA in GSMBRSET as the template . PCR was performed on a Rotor-Gene Q QIAGEN , Valencia , CA as follows 2 min at 50 C and 10 min at 95 C , then 40 cycles of 95 C for 15 s and 60 C for 1 min . Expression levels were calculated with the Rotor-Gene Q Series Software QIAGEN by the 2 DDCt method . The cycling threshold Ct of the target gene was compared with the Ct of ACTB cDNA , and DCt was expressed as Ct of SYT14 Ct of ACTB . DDCt was expressed as DCt of the control sample DCt of each sample , and relative concentration was determined as 2-DDCt . Expression in the kidney and the cerebral cortex was used as the control in Figures 2A– 2D . SYT14 was predominantly expressed in human adult and fetal brain tissues Figures 2A and 2B . Even in mice , substantial expression in the brain was confirmed but , not predominant Figure 2C . Among various brain regions in mice , SYT14 was mostly expressed in the cere-bellum Figure 2D . Intracellular distribution of SYT14 in cultured cells was investigated . The full-length SYT14 PCR product amplified from human brain cDNA MHS4426-99239810 , Open Biosystems , Huntsville , AL was used as a template and subcloned into pDONR221 the entry vector of Gateway system , Invitrogen . We used site-directed mutagenesis to produce the SYT14 mutant and variants by using a muta-genesis kit Toyobo , Osaka , Japan . Variants include c.611C T and c.810_812del , which are registered in dbSNP130 , and c.548G A , which was detected in an SCA patient with autosomal-dominant inheritance but did not segregate with the phenotype , indicating that it is nonpathogenic Table S3 . All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing . Each construct was recloned into the pEF-DEST51 mammalian expression vector Invitrogen and transfected to COS-1 cells with the FuGENER6 trans-fection reagent Roche Applied Science , Mannheim , Germany according to the manufacturer’s instructions . Localization of the mutant p.Gly484Asp was clearly different from that of the wild-type and other normal variants . Whereas the wild-type and other variants were localized to the perinuclear and submembranous regions , p.Gly484Asp was localized in the cytoplasm significant amounts were in the perinuclear region but formed a characteristic reticular pattern without showing any sub-membranous distribution Figures 2E and S2B . Confocal microscopic analysis showed that the p.Gly484Asp mutant was colocalized with an endoplasmic reticulum ER marker , protein disulfide isomerase PDI , throughout the cells , whereas the wild-type colocalized with PDI domi-nantly in perinuclear regions Figure 2F . immunoblot analysis combined with subcellular fractionation of the transfected cells further confirmed that the mutant was distributed differently from the wild-type . The wild-type and the mutant p.Gly484Asp were distributed in the nucleus and Golgi apparatus fractions however , only the mutant was detected in microsome fractions containing ER fragments together with an ER membrane marker , cal-nexin Figure S1 .17 These data suggest that improper folding of the mutant protein results in abnormal reten-tion in the ER . To investigate the effect of the p.Gly484Asp mutation in the C2B domain on phospholipid binding activity , we amplified cDNA of C2B domains from the wild-type and the p.Gly484Asp mutant from SYT14-expressing vectors by using the following primers sense , 50-GGATCCGAAA GTACATCCTCATGTCA-30 and antisense , 50-TCATGAC TCTAGCAACGCAT-30 . We then recloned the cDNA into Escherichia coli E. coli expressing vector pGEX-4T-3 . The C2B domain of SYT14 fused to glutathione S-trans-ferase GST was expressed in E. coli JM109 and purified by standard protocols . Both GST-SYT14-C2B WT and GST-SYT14-C2B p.Gly484Asp could be mostly purified of contamination by degradation products , but the amount of GST-SYT14-C2B p.Gly484Asp obtained was at least four times smaller than that of GST-SYT14-C2B WT data not shown . Liposome phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylserine , 1 1 , w w cosedimentation assay with purified GST-SYT14-C2B was performed as described previously.18 The result showed that the SYT14-C2B p.Gly484Asp bound liposomes similarly to SYT14-C2B WT Figure 2G , indicating that the p.Gly484Asp muta-tion had no effect on the Ca2 ? -independent phospho-lipid-binding activity of the SYT14-C2B domain . The Allen Mouse Brain Atlas indicates that Syt14 is ex-pressedinPurkinjecellsofthecerebelluminmice however , SYT14 localization has not been fully investigated.15 A rabbit polyclonal anti-SYT14 antibody Ab-SYT14 was generated for immunoblotting and immunocytochemistry Operon Biotechnologies , Tokyo , Japan Figure S2 . Immu-nohistochemical analysis of mouse and human brains was performed with Ab-SYT14 , as previously described.19–21 Mouse brain sections were prepared at the RIKEN Brain Science Institute . Mouse experimental protocols were approved by the animal experiment committee of the RIKENBrainScienceInstitute.ThefrozenbrainofC57BL 6J mouse was mounted in Tissue-Tek and sliced to 10 mm sections with a freezing microtome . A human adult brain specimen was obtained through the postmortem examina-tion of a brain from a control subject without neurodegen-erative disorders . Informed consent was obtained from the family on the basis of the IRB-approved protocol of Yokohama City University School of Medicine . The human brain was fixed in 10 % formalin and cut into 1-cm-thick slices . Sliced tissues were embedded in paraffin wax , and 5 mm sections were immunostained with primary anti-bodies and visualized with the Vectastain ABC kit Vector Laboratories , Burlingame , CA . Selective localization of SYT14 Syt14 in Purkinje cells of the mouse cerebellum Figure 3A and human cerebellum Figure 3B were recog-nized , indicating that SYT14 plays an important role in the cerebellum . These data are in agreement with a scenario in which the SYT14 mutation causes cerebellar degenera-tion in this family . In this study , only one p.Gly484Asp mutation of SYT14 was identified in association with SCA . Quintero-Rivera et al.16 previously described a 12-year-old female with cerebral atrophy , absence seizures , developmental delay with a WISC III score of 58 for full IQ , and de novo t 1 3 q32.1 q25.1 disrupting SYT14 . Her brain MRI showed diffuse cerebral atrophy , including that of the cere - bellar hemisphere and vermis . Although the inheritance modes are different recessive impact on our family and dominant on the female patient , mild to moderate mental retardation and cerebellar atrophy are common among patients with SYT14 abnormalities . It will be important to assess the future phenotype of the female patient studied by Quintero-Rivera et al.16 Relatively common ARCAs in Japan include ataxia , early-onset oculomotor apraxia , hypoalbuminemia ataxia-oculomotor apraxia 1 EAOH AOA1 [ MIM 208920 ] ataxia-oculomotor apraxia 2 AOA2 [ MIM 606002 ] spastic ataxia Charlevoix-Saguenay type SACS [ MIM 270550 ] ataxia with isolated vitamin E deficiency AVED [ MIM 277460 ] and ataxia-telangiectasia AT [ MIM 208900 ] . Friedrich ataxia 1 [ FRDA MIM 229300 ] has never been described in the Japanese population . In this family , patients never showed ocularmotor apraxia , spasticity , peripheral neuropathy , retinal abnormality , immunolog-ical abnormality , or other systemic involvements . As an adult-onset type of pure ARCA , SYNE1-related ARCA also known as spinocerebellar ataxia , autosomal-recessive 8 SCAR8 [ MIM610743 ] isfoundtobecausedbymutations ofthegeneencodingsynapticnuclearenvelopeprotein1.22 Furthermore , these patients were not associated with psychomotor retardation . Thus , SYT14-mutated ARCA , described here , should be categorized to a distinct type of ARCA . SYTs is a large family of transmembrane proteins associ-ated with exocytosis of secretory vesicles including syn-aptic vesicles .23 The mammalian SYT family is composed of 17 members . SYTs are anchored to the secretory vesicles via a single transmembrane domain TM close to its N terminus and have tandem cytoplasmic domains , C2A and C2B.24 Among SYTs , SYT1 MIM 185605 is involved in neurotransmitter release and has been intensively studied . The crystal structure of the C2 domains consists of a compact eight-stranded b-barrel with two protruding loops loops 1 and 3 that form the Ca2 ? -binding pockets.25 SYT1 binds three and two Ca2 ? ions via loops 1 and 3 of C2A and C2B , respectively . Ca2 ? binding triggers the rapid penetration of the C2 domains into membranes harboring negatively charged phospholipids . Ca2 ? also promotes SYT1 binding to t-SNAREs target-membrane-soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptors . SYT1 is a key sensor for evoked and synchronous neurotransmitter release in many classes of neurons.23 SYT14 also has TM , C2A , and C2B domains , but it has no conserved Ca2 ? -binding motif that includes the conserved aspartic acid residues in loops 1 and 3 of C2A and C2B.26 Although the roles of SYTs as Ca2 ? sensors have been studied extensively , little is known about Ca2 ? -independent SYTs , which might inhibit the SNARE-catalyzed fusion in both the absence and presence of Ca2 ? .27 Recently , Zhang et al.28 suggested that Ca2 ? -inde-pendent SYT4 MIM 600103 negatively regulates exocy-tosis , regardless of its inability to induce Ca2 ? -dependent exocytosis . SYT14 has phospholipid-binding activity that is Ca2 ? independent.14 The glycine residue mutated in the family is located around the C2B domain loop 1 , which plays an important role in binding to phospholipids in SYT1.25 We confirmed that , compared to the wild-type , the mutation did not alter the binding activity of SYT14 to phospho-lipids . In an overexpression system , wild-type SYT14 as well as normal variants were distributed in the cytoplasm close to the plasma membrane , showing in-line accu-mulation along with the membrane . In contrast , the p.Gly484Asp mutant showed a different reticular distri-bution pattern . In the ER , several cotranslational and posttranslational modifications that are required for the correct folding of transmembrane and secretory proteins take place.29,30 Incompletely folded proteins are generally excluded from ER exit sites.29 The fact that the p.Gly484Asp was not properly transferred from the ER suggests that the mutant protein might not fold correctly . The lower yield of the mutant protein as compared to the wild-type in the bacterial expression system we performed also supports the improper folding of the mutant . Abnormal distribution in the ER might result in the loss of function of SYT14 or in ER dysfunction . In conclusion we have shown that SYT14 is localized specifically in Purkinje cells of mouse and human cere-bellum . The results strongly support the involvement of SYT14 in the pathogenesis of SCA and are consistent with the atrophy of the cerebellum seen in both patients . A possible relationship between SYTs and neurodegenera-tion has been suggested previously , 31 and here we provide data that support the idea that disruption of an SYT protein is involved in human neurodegeneration and that exocy-tosis machinery can be involved in one of the pathome-chanisms of neurodegeneration .

21839423	Generalized pustular psoriasis GPP is a rare and poten-tially life-threatening disease characterized by episodic , widespread skin inflammation with pustule development associated with marked systemic features Figure 1 . Acute attacks are associated with pregnancy and may be triggered by infection and exposure to drugs . GPP may be the only manifestation of disease or occur with other forms of psori-asis , including psoriasis vulgaris PV and palmar-plantar pustulosis PPP .1 Although GPP is classified as a variant of psoriasis , the striking clinical and histological differ-ences indicate that it is likely to be a disease of distinct etiology . Here , we sought to identify disease-causal alleles for GPP by using an established exome-sequencing strategy.2 We selected five unrelated affected individuals with GPP Table 1 on the basis of the following criteria 1 recur-rent , severe GPP requiring hospital admission 2 absence of associated PV and 3 absence of the HLA-Cw*0602 allele , the major genetic determinant of PV , at the HLA-C locus.3 The clinical features of each of the five subjects are presented in Table 1 . None had a family history of GPP . All subjects provided full written consent , and ethical approval for this study was obtained from St Thomas’ Hospital Research Ethics Committee reference 06 Q0702 7 . DNA was extracted from blood , and whole-exome capture was performed by in-solution hybridization fol-lowed by massively parallel sequencing . Three micrograms of genomic DNA was sheared via focused acoustic tech-nology Covaris , yielding a mean fragment size of 150 bp . Fragment ends were repaired and sequencing adap-tors were ligated . The sequence library was hybridized for 24 hr with biotinylated 120 bp RNA probes designed against coding regions of the genome Agilent . Streptavi-din-coated magnetic beads were utilized to retain DNA bound to the RNA probes , while unbound DNA was washed off . The exome-enriched pool of DNA was then eluted and amplified with a low-cycle PCR . Finally , the en-riched DNA fragments were sequenced with 76 bp paired-end reads on the Illumina GAIIx platform . The resulting reads were aligned to the reference human genome hg18 , NCBI build 36 with Novoalign Novocraft Technol-ogies . Over 4.7 Gb of sequence was generated for each subject , such that 75 % of the coding bases of the GENCODE-defined exome were represented by at least 20 reads Table S1 available online . Single-nucleotide sub-stitutions and small insertion deletion variants were iden-tified with Samtools4 and annotated with respect to coding genes with the Annovar software package5 Table S2 . Because vertical transmission has not been reported for GPP , and the proband GPP-01 II-5 is the offspring of con-sanguineous parents Figure 2 , we prioritized analysis of theexome variant profiles with a modelof a rare autosomal-recessive inheritance . This analysis required the presence of at least one homozygous or two heterozygous noncon-servative sequence changes nonsynonymous splice-site A Individual GPP-02 II 1 . Note extensive plaques of erythema with superimposed pustules on the arm . B Individual GPP-01 II 5 . Note erythematous , intensely inflamed skin with active pustulation and desquamation on the buttocks . C Individual GPP-03 II 2 . Note widespread , healing erythema-tous plaques following active pustulation on the legs . substitution or coding insertion deletion occurring with an estimated population frequency of 0.01 in the same gene , in all five individuals . Population-frequency estimates were derived from the March 2011 data release of the 1000 Genomes Project and from 250 control exome variant profiles sequenced via the same method-ology in our laboratory . The analysis failed to identify a single gene fitting a rare recessive model in all five individuals . However , evaluation of the data with a prior expectation of genetic heterogeneity revealed IL36RN previously known as IL1F5 , MIM 605507 , RefSeq NM_173170.1 as the only gene harboring low-frequency variants compatible with recessive inheritance in three of the five subjects Table 2 . Two GPP-01 II 5 and GPP-02 II 1 were homozygous for a c.338C T p.Ser113Leu missense substitution , whereas the third subject GPP-03 II 2 was found to be compound hetero-zygous for c.338C T p.Ser113Leu and a c.142C T p.Arg48Trp missense substitution . The identified variants were each confirmed by Sanger sequencing Figure 2 . Genotyping of these substitutions in available unaffected family members confirmed that the segregation of the variants was consistent with a reces-sive inheritance pattern for IL36RN-associated GPP Figure 2 . Neither variant has been observed by the 1000 Genomes Project or observed in the homozygous state in 250 ethnically matched control individuals . A single carrier of the c.338C T p.Ser113Leu missense substitu-tion was observed in our control cohort no other coding variation in IL36RN was observed in this individual . Sanger sequencing of the two individuals in whom no mutation was identified by exome sequencing confirmed the wild-type sequence . It is of note that PPP was observed in these two cases . PPP is a clinical feature not present in the three individuals in whom we identified IL36RN muta-tions , these findings are therefore consistent with the notion that mutation of IL36RN is responsible for a specific subtype of GPP not associated with PPP . This specificity was further supported by Sanger sequencing of the four IL36RN coding exons and their associated splice sites in a cohort of 30 individuals with a range of pustular forms of psoriasis , including GPP , in individuals with preexisting PV and PPP . Wild-type coding sequence was observed in all subjects . In addition , no significant association of common variation at the IL36RN locus with PV was observed under recessive or additive models in data avail-able from a large genome-wide association study of psori-asis previously undertaken by our group data not shown .3 IL36RN has also been previously investigated in psoriatic arthritis although association was reported with variants in other genes located within the IL1 gene cluster , no direct association was observed with a variant located in intron 1 of IL36RN rs990524 .6 More recently , a genome-wide association study of psoriatic arthritis did not report association to IL36RN locus.7 IL36RN belongs to the IL-1 cytokine family , which comprises a group of evolutionary ancient cytokines with potent and critical roles in innate immunity a system of cells , receptors , and mediators that provides a rapid and nonspecific response to pathogens . There are 11 IL-1 family members , nine of which are clustered in a 400 kb region on chromosome 2 . Like many members of the IL-1 family , IL36RN and its paralogs IL36A MIM 605509 , IL36B MIM 605508 , and IL36G MIM 605542 previ-ously known as IL1F6 , IL1F8 , and IL1F9 , respectively are abundantly expressed in skin . The proteins encoded by these genes modulate NF-kB signaling , through their inter-action with the IL-1RL2 receptor previously known as IL-1Rrp2 .8,9 IL36RN in particular antagonizes the activity of IL-36A and IL-36G , by blocking the recruitment of the IL-1RL2 receptor complex.10 IL36RN itself consists of a putative signal peptide followed by a large IL-1 homology motif , thus reflecting the typical domain architecture of IL-1 family cytokines.10 In this context , homology searches and three-dimensional structural modeling demonstrated that both the p.R48W and the p.S113L mutation affect evolutionary conserved IL36RN residues . which are located in close proximity to critical binding residues Figure 3 .11 Both missense substitutions are pre-dicted by SIFT to be damaging.12 To assess the functional impact of the p.Ser113Leu mutation , we obtained periph-eral-blood mononuclear cells PBMCs from a homozygous affected individual GPP-02 II 1 and an unrelated healthy volunteer . We examined the effect of IL-36A stimulation on the production of four NF-kB-induced proinflammatory cytokines IL-1a , IL-6 , IL-8 , and TNF . After 7 hr of treat-ment with 1 mg ml IL-36A R D Systems , both intracel-lular transcript levels Applied Biosystems TaqMan Gene Expression assays and extracellular protein secretion Millipore MILLIPLEX MAP Human Cytokine Chemokine panel and a Luminex FLEXMAP 3D flow-based analyzer were measured . The induction of TNF mRNA was not analyzed because the 7 hr time point exceeds the time span of the gene transcriptional response . Both sets of experiments demonstrated a marked increased in cytokine production in the affected individual PBMCs Figure 4 , in keeping with the notion that the p.Ser113Leu missense substitution affects the ability of IL36RN to antagonize IL36A-induced NF-kB signaling . In mice , abnormal Il-36 signaling due to Il1f6 the mouse ortholog of IL-36A overexpression results in transient skin inflammation characterized by acanthosis , hyperkeratosis , and a mixed-cell infiltrate rich in neutrophils , 13 features observed in both PV and GPP . When crossed with Il1f5 the mouse ortholog of IL36RN -deficient mice , the skin phenotype is strikingly enhanced and persistent with extensive pustule formation.13 Taken together , these data provide the platform to postulate that GPP is caused by abnormal IL-36A signaling resulting from IL36RN loss-of-function mutations . The variable age at onset of clinical manifestations of GPP in the three individuals in whom Any x of five individuals 1 2 3 4 5 Genes with homozygous or 6721 5141 4030 3108 2162 compound-heterozygous nonsynonymous , splice-site , or insertion deletion variants With an estimated frequency 0.01 80 5 1 0 0 we have identified mutations in IL36RN suggests a complex interaction among this major genetic determinant , poten-tial environmental triggers , and or additional genetic modifiers . Interestingly mutations in another IL-1 family receptor antagonist , IL1RN MIM 147679 , have recently been reported to cause an autoinflammatory disease char-acterized in part by pustular skin eruptions MIM 612852 .14,15 However , there are notable differences between this disease and GPP , including neonatal onset and major skeletal abnormalities . Finally , it is also of interest that anakinra , a recombinant IL-1 receptor antag-onist IL-1RA , has been reported to be effective in two individuals with GPP , 16 providing evidence for the clinical benefit of treatment targeting IL1 family pathways . GPP is a severe , debilitating , and potentially life-threat-ening disease . Our data indicate that mutations in IL36RN underlie this distinct form of pustular disease , separate from other forms of psoriasis . They implicate defects of the innate immune system and highlight IL-1 signaling as a potential target for therapeutic intervention .

21849422	PURPOSE . To estimate the normal value of macular pigment optical density MPOD in an adult south Indian sample . METHODS . Three hundred eyes of 161 healthy volunteers 30 men and 30 women in each of the age groups of 20–29 , 30–39 , 40–49 , 50–59 , and 60 years underwent MPOD measure-ment with a macular densitometer . Thirty-two eyes were also checked for intersession variability . RESULTS . The mean MPODs in the Indian sample were 0.64 0.23 log unit at 0.25° eccentricity , 0.50 0.21 log unit at 0.5° , 0.37 0.19 log unit at 1.00° , and 0.21 0.16 log unit at 1.75° . At all the foveal eccentricities , the MPOD showed an increase from 20 to 29 to 30 to 39 years of age and thereby showed a decrease with age . The men aged 40 to 49 years had signifi-cantly higher MPOD than did the women 0.75 vs. 0.62 log unit , P 0.039 , and the women aged 50 to 59 years had higher MPOD than did the men 0.71 vs. 0.57 log unit , P 0.019 . There was no significant intersession or interocular variation . CONCLUSIONS . This study establishes the MPOD normogram in an adult Indian sample . Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci . 2011 52 7910–7916 DOI 10.1167 iovs.11-7636 Mtein acular pigment consists of two hydroxy carotenoids lu-and zeaxanthin.1,2 Visually , macular pigment pres - and zeaxanthin.1,2 Visually , macular pigment pres-ents as a yellow coloration concentrated in the fovea . Fundus reflectance and autofluorescence maps show ring patterns in the distribution of the macular pigment.3 Macular carotenoids reach their highest levels in the axons of the photoreceptors and inner plexiform layers of the retina.2–5 It has been pro-posed that macular carotenoids are related to visual perfor-mance in both normal subjects and those with ocular pathol-ogies.6–10 Epidemiologic studies have shown a controversial relationship between age-related macular degeneration AMD and the macular pigment optical density MPOD . Although a few studies have shown an inverse relationship between AMD and MPOD , 11–14 most failed to prove any relationship.15–17 There are ethnic differences in macular pigment distribu-tion . It is reported to be higher in African 0.59 0.14 density units [ DU ] than in white 0.36 0.13 DU non-Hispanics.18 Tang et al.19 estimated the average MPOD in Asian Chinese to be 0.48 0.23 , which was higher than in the white non-Hispanics but lower than in the Africans . Age and MPOD have a controversial relationship , with several studies , with various sample sizes and different techniques reporting different rela-tionships between the two.20 Lam et al.21 showed a decline in macular pigment with age and significant sex differences in the middle age groups . Most of the studies are not comparable because of the difference in measuring techniques used , in-cluding heterochromatic flicker photometry HFP , high-per-formance liquid chromatography , Raman resonance spectros-copy , and auto fluorescence.20 The relationship between sex and MPOD is equally contro-versial , with a few studies finding males having 13 % to 30 % higher MPOD than females , 22–24 whereas other found no effect of a subject’s sex on MPOD.11,19,25–28 Reports on macular pigment density in an adult urban Indian population are not available . This study was conducted to fill this gap . Disclosure R. Raman , None R. Rajan , None S. Biswas , None K. Vaitheeswaran , None T. Sharma , None Corresponding author .

MATERIALS AND METHODS Investigative Ophthalmology Visual Science , October 2011 , Vol . 52 , No. 11 Copyright 2011 The Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology , Inc . RESULTS Three hundred eyes of 161 volunteers who fulfilled the inclusion and exclusion criteria were recruited for the study . Figure 2 shows the frequency distribution of the MPOD values at 0.25° , 0.50° , 1.00° , and 1.75° foveal eccentricities . The mean MPOD was 0.64 0.23 log unit range , 0.08–1.29 at 0.25° foveal eccentricity , 0.50 0.21 log unit 0.00 to 1.11 at 0.50° , 0.37 0.19 log unit 0.15 to 0.98 at 1.00° , and 0.21 0.16 log unit 0.17 to 0.82 at 1.75° . The mean time SD taken to measure MPOD at all four foveal eccentricities monocularly was 18 8 minutes range , 6–51 minutes . Figure 3 shows the mean MPOD at each eccentricity for the different age groups . In Figure 3A , the mean MPOD at 0.25° foveal eccentricity shows an increase from 20 to 29 years 0.63 0.16 log units to 30 to 39 years 0.72 0.22 log units . Thereafter , MPOD declined in age groups 40 to 49 , 50 to 59 , and 60 years 0.69 , 0.64 , and 0.51 , respectively . Figure 3B shows the MPOD at 0.50° foveal eccentricity to be increased from 20 to 29 years 0.51 0.16 log units to 30 to 39 years 0.55 0.23 log units . Thereafter , MPOD declined in the age groups 40 to 49 , 50 to 59 , and 60 years 0.52 , 0.50 , and 0.41 , respectively . Similarly , the MPOD at 1.00° foveal eccentricity Fig. 3C shows an increase from 20 to 29 0.39 0.16 log units to 30 to 39 0.42 0.20 log units years . Thereafter , MPOD declined in age groups 40 to 49 , 50 to 59 , and 60 years 0.40 , 0.36 , and 0.27 , respectively . Although a similar trend was seen at 1.75° foveal eccentricity Fig. 3D , it was not statistically significant P 0.401 . The mean MPOD values in men and women at 0.25° , 0.50° , 1.00° , and 1.75° foveal eccentricities are summarized in Table 1 . There were no differences between the sexes in mean MPOD until age 40 years . Between 40 to 49 years , the men had higher MPOD than the women at 0.25° 0.75 0.28 in men vs. 0.62 0.18 log unit in women P 0.039 . Be-tween 50 and 59 years of age , women had higher MPODs than men at the 0.25° , 0.50° , and 1.00° foveal eccentricities 0.57 vs. 0.71 at 0.25° P 0.019 , 0.45 vs. 0.55 at 0.50° P 0.041 , and 0.30 vs. 0.42 at 1.00° P 0.017 , respectively . After 60 years , there again was no difference in mean MPOD between the sexes . The mean interocular differences were approximately 0.04 0.15 , 0.03 0.14 , 0.03 0.14 , and 0.02 0.12 at 0.25° , 0.50° , 1.00° and 1.75° foveal eccentricities , respectively none was statistically significant . Figure 4 shows the Bland-Altman plots obtained at the first and repeat sessions . The mean difference SD in MPOD at 0.25° between the first and repeat session was 0.03 0.10 , with a 95 % confidence inter-val for the mean difference of 0.23 to 0.17 . The mean differ - ence SD in MPOD at 0.50° between the first and repeat sessions was 0.01 0.11 , with a 95 % confidence interval for this mean difference of 0.21 to 0.24 . The mean difference SD in MPOD at 1.00° between the first and repeat session was 0.0 0.12 with a 95 % confidence interval for this mean difference of 0.25 to 0.26 . The mean difference SD in MPOD at 1.75° between the first and repeat session was 0.0 0.09 with a 95 % confidence interval for this mean differ-ence of 0.19 to 0.17 . Cronbach’s values for the test retest sessions were 0.945 , 0.919 , 0.872 , and 0.791 at 0.25° , 0.50° , 1.00° , and 1.75° foveal eccentricity , respectively . DISCUSSION Table 2 compares the MPOD measurement in the present study with those in other studies published in the literature . We included only studies that in which HFP was used to measure the MPOD . After statistically comparing our data with results from the other studies approximately one half U.S.-based and the other half from other countries , we found our study to have significantly higher MPOD than that found in the U.S.-based studies22,28,30–41 0.50 vs. 0.32 , P 0.0027 , whereas , compared with studies from other coun-tries , 1,8,11,19,27,29,42–46 results were not significantly different 0.50 vs. 0.38 , P 0.056 . This is the first report of MPOD in an Indian sample . The MPODs were higher in our Indian sample than in other studies . The difference can be attributed to higher intakes of a vegetarian diet rich in carotenoids Ham-mond BR , et al . IOVS 2002 43 ARVO E-Abstract 3604 . Ciulla et al.28 have shown that individuals with brown-black irises have 19 % higher MPOD than those with blue-gray irises . South Mean SD Mean SD Age Groups Sex n Log Units P n Log Units Indian populations have predominantly brown-black irises , which may also explain the higher MPOD in the Indian popu-lation . The macular pigment level increased up to the 30-to 39-year age group and then declined at all eccentricities . Similar to our findings , Lam et al.21 also found that the highest average MPODs were recorded in the 40-to 59-year age group . Thus , there is an increase in MPOD up to 40 years . Thereafter , we found a decline in MPOD in all age groups and in both sexes . This negative correlation of age and MPOD has been seen in other studies.11,21,33 The age-related decline in MPOD could be due to the excessive depletion because of utilization of lutein Foveal Eccentricities P n Log Units P n Log Units P P and zeaxanthin due to the age-related increase in oxidative stress.33,45 It could also be due to inadequate accumulation of macular carotenoids , because of age-related changes in dietary intake , absorption , and transport of serum carote-noid.46,47 However , there are studies that show no effect of age on MPOD.20 TABLE 2 . Comparison of MPOD Values in Various Published Studies Our study Recently published studies pertaining to sex differences in MPOD are conflicting . Some studies report that males have higher MPOD than do females , 22–24 whereas others deny any relationship.11,19,25–28 We found that the men in our study had higher MPOD than did the women in the 40-to 49-year age group . Hammond et al.22 also reported higher MPODs in men . However , in the 50-to 59-year age group , the women had higher MPODs than did the men . These differences can be explained by hormonally controlled variations in the lipid transport system , which is used by carotenoids.45 Steroid hor-mones , may also affect the metabolism of carotenoids di-rectly.45 Also women are known to have a higher percentage body fat , which is also known to affect MPOD.38,45 We found an exponential decrease in MPOD with increas-ing eccentricity from the fovea . Our MPOD data showed a unimodal distribution that was similar to that in HFP studies by Snodderly et al. , 37 Wooten and Hammond , 48 Hammond et al. , 49 Lam et al. , 21 and Beatty et al.11 Whereas , studies per-formed by Berendschot and van Norren , 3 Delori et al. , 50 and Wolf et al.18 showed a bimodal distribution with a central peak surrounded by a ring with high-density values of MP when they measured with fundus reflectance , autofluorescence , and mod-ified confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscopy . We found no significant interocular difference in MPOD . This finding was consistent with those in previous re-ports.21,27,45,51,52 The subjects did not show any significant difference in sex or age . Our study is unique , as it is the first report of MPOD distribution in a sample of the Indian popula-tion . This is important , as there is evidence that age-related macular degeneration is less prevalent in the Indian subconti-nent . Unlike other studies , the distribution in various age groups and between the sexes was uniform in this sample . Thus , the effect of age and sex could be established in a better manner . The study had some limitations . Being a descriptive study , we did not examine the factors that might influence MPOD levels except age and sex . The increased level of melanin in darker eyes , especially near the fovea might alter the measure-ment of MPOD and provide a lower MPOD.53 Possible artifacts that might have influenced the data include subjects who did not turn the knob themselves . In conclusion , this study estab-lishes the MPOD normogram in an Indian sample . This infor-mation will be useful in understanding the epidemiology and presentations of age-related macular degeneration in this pop-ulation .

Introduction Corneal endothelium plays a critical role in maintaining corneal hydration and corneal transparency . Adult human corneal endothelial cells CECs are unique in that they are mitotically inactive and are arrested at the G1 phase of the cell cycle Joyce , 2003 . Despite the presence of fibroblast growth factor-2 FGF-2 , a potent mitogenic factor that is stored in Descemet’s membrane Kay et al. , 1993 , corneal endothelium in vivo remains anti-proliferative throughout its life span . When cornea is injured , the wound repair process of corneal endothelium appears to have two distinct pathways 1 the regenerative pathway , by which CECs do not replicate but are replaced by migration and spreading of existing endothelial cells and 2 the nonregenerative pathway or fibrosis , by which trans-formed endothelial cells not only resume proliferation but alter their cell morphology and collagen phenotypes , leading to the production of an abnormal fibrillar extracellular matrix ECM . One such clinical example is the formation of a retrocorneal fibrous * Corresponding author . Doheny Eye Institute , 1355 San Pablo St. , DVRC203 , Los Angeles , CA 90033 , USA .

Kay . membrane RCFM between Descemet’s membrane and the corneal endothelium , the physical presence of which causes loss of vision Waring , 1982 . A RCFM can be developed by epithelial , keratocytic , and endothelial origins Jakobiec and Bhat , 2010 . This review , however , will only discuss endothelial mesenchymal trans-formation EMT observed in RCFM of endothelial origin . Fig. 1A shows such endothelial origin-RCFM produced in a rabbit cornea using a transcorneal freezing procedure Kay et al. , 1982 . An in vitro model to elucidate the molecular mechanism of RCFM led us to the finding that FGF-2 exerts a key role in such endothelial to mesenchymal transformation Fig. 1B first , FGF-2 signaling directly regulates cell cycle progression by degrading p27Kip1 p27 , a negative regulator of the G1 phase of the cell cycle , leading to a marked stimulation of cell proliferation Lee and Kay , 2007 , 2008 second , FGF-2 signaling upregulates the steady-state levels of a1 I collagen RNA by stabilizing the message and subse-quently facilitates synthesis and secretion of type I collagen into the extracellular space Ko and Kay , 2005 and third , FGF-2 signaling induces a change in cell shape from a polygonal to a fibroblastic morphology and causes the loss of the contact-inhibited monolayer Fig. 1B Lee and Kay , 2006a . We also discovered that interleukin-1b IL-1b exerts a critical role as a switch of the FGF-2-mediated EMT IL-1b induces FGF-2 through the phosphatidylinositol PI 3-kinase and p38 pathways in CECs Lee and Kay , 2009 . We also confirmed this to be the case in vivo , in which polymorphonuclear leukocytes PMNs infiltrating the anterior chamber are a major source of IL-1b , which subsequently induces production of FGF-2 in corneal endothelium Song et al. , 2010 . These in vivo findings provide a mechanism to link between the injury-mediated inflammation and FGF-2-mediated EMT . 2 . FGF-2 and its signaling pathways FGF-2 belongs to the 23-member FGF family . This ubiquitous and multifunctional regulator is involved in the proliferation , angiogenesis , and differentiation of a broad spectrum of meso-dermal and neuro-ectodermal cells Bikfalvi et al. , 1997 Ornitz and Itoh , 2001 . Five isoforms of FGF-2 , with molecular weights ranging from 18 to 34 kDa , have been identified all five are derived from a single messenger RNA four high molecular weight HMW iso-forms that arise from upstream CUG codons and one 18-kDa ECM isoform that arises from the downstream AUG codon Arnaud et al. , 1999 Prats et al. , 1989 . The HMW isoforms contain nuclear-localization signals thus these proteins are found in the nucleus . The 18-kDa FGF-2 , on the other hand , is primarily a cytosolic protein without a signal peptide sequence but it is generally sequestered to the extracellular matrix by heparan sulphate proteoglycans HSPGs . Recent studies described unconventional secretion of FGF-2 , which is independent of the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi pathway FGF-2 is initially recruited to the inner leaflet of plasma membrane , followed by membrane translocation in an HSPGs-dependent manner Nickel , 2007 . In mammals , there are four transmembrane FGF receptors with tyrosine kinase activity Johnson and Williams , 1993 Hynes and Dey , 2010 . Following ligand binding and receptor dimerization , the kinase domains transphosphorylate each other , leading to the docking of adaptor proteins and the activation of four key down-stream pathways Ras-Raf-MAPK , PI 3-kinase-Akt , signal trans-ducer and activator of transcription , and PKC activated via phospholipase Cg Dailey et al. , 2005 . Signaling is also negatively regulated at several levels by the induction of negative regulators , including Sprouty , Casitas B-lineage lymphoma Cbl , and phos-phatases Turner and Grose , 2010 . Thus , FGF signaling is modu-lated by both positive and negative mechanisms , and subtle changes in the signal may be of great importance for determining the biological responses during development , homeostasis , or wound healing . We will only discuss the signal transduction trig-gered by the 18 kDa isoform , which causes EMT in CECs . 3 . FGF-2 Its role in mitogenic pathway In the FGF-2-mediated mitotic pathway , cell proliferation of CECs progresses by removal of p27 from the G1 phase of the cell cycle Lee and Kay , 2007 . The important regulatory role of p27 in CECs during development was reported in a study that showed p27 was involved in regulating proliferation in the corneal endothelium of the developing mouse cornea Yoshida et al. , 2004 . The activity of p27 is greatly controlled by its concentration the level of p27 is mainly regulated by ubiquitin-proteasome-mediated proteolysis Pagano et al. , 1995 Lu et al. , 2009 . The cell cycle-dependent degradation of p27 requires phosphorylation of p27 at threonine Thr or serine residues Ser there are at least four known phos-phorylation sites Thr187 , Ser10 , Thr157 , and Thr198 . The cyclin-dependent kinase 2 Cdk2 -Cyclin E complex is responsible for phosphorylation of p27 at Thr187 Sherr and Roberts , 1999 Lee and Kay , 2007 , while Akt phosphorylates p27 on Ser10 , Thr157 , and Thr198 Fujita et al. , 2002 Liang et al. , 2002 . The Ser10 residue is also phosphorylated by kinase-interacting stathmin KIS , a nuclear serine-threonine kinase Boehm et al. , 2002 Lee and Kay , 2011 . Our kinetic studies Lee and Kay , 2007 , 2008 using the two sites of Ser10 and Thr187 led us to conclude that phosphorylated p27 at Thr187 and at Ser10 represents two distinct populations of p27 in the G1 phase of the cell cycle . We reported that phosphorylation of p27 at Ser10 is an early G1 event , as opposed to the late G1 event observed with phosphorylation of p27 at Thr187 , and that phos-phorylation of p27 at Ser10 is the major mechanism for G1 S transition in response to FGF-2 stimulation . We also found that rabbit CECs rCECs employ both PI 3-kinase and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 2 ERK1 2 signaling in parallel for G1 S transition following FGF-2 stimulation Lee and Kay , 2011 . Both PI 3-kinase and ERK1 2 pathways are involved in phosphorylation of p27 at Ser10 by KIS and at Thr187 by Cdk2 activated by Cdc25A cell division cycle 25A , which dephosphor-ylates the inactive phospho-Cdk2 at Tyr15 Chen and Gardner , 2004 . We further demonstrated that FGF-2 induces expression of KIS and Cdc25A through PI 3-kinase and ERK1 2 pathways . Thus , CECs under proliferative control employ multiple pathways to remove the strong G1 inhibitor p27 from the scene . The cytoskeletal elements with their polymerization dynamics are central to many cellular activities , including morphogenesis and wound healing . Assembly and organization of the actin cytoskel-eton is regulated by Rho small GTPases , Rho , Rac , and Cdc42 Etienne-Manneville and Hall , 2002 . The conclusion that Rho , Rac , and Cdc42 regulate three separate signal transduction pathways stress fiber , lamellipodia , and filopodia linking the plasma membrane receptor to the assembly of distinct F-actin structures has been confirmed in a wide variety of cell systems . Unlike in these other cell systems , the formation of lamellipodia and filopodia is not readily observed in CECs in culture Lee and Kay , 2006a . We showed that FGF-2 disrupts stress fibers and reorganizes actin cytoskeleton at the cortex by inhibiting Rho activity and activating Rac . Such inactivation of Rho is mediated by activated Rac through the action of PI 3-kinase , suggesting that Rac is upstream to Rho . Our study demonstrates the antagonizing activities between Rho and Rac and between Rho and Cdc42 . Simultaneously , the polygonal cell morphology of CECs is altered to the elongated shape as actin cytoskeleton is reorganized from the stress fiber phenotype to the cortical actin phenotype . Of great interest , PI 3-kinase regulates all of these cellular activities related to actin cytoskeleton and cellular morphology . We also reported that activation of Cdc42 and inactivation of RhoA are required to acquire the elongated cell shape with protrusive processes Lee and Kay , 2006b CECs transiently transfected with constitutive active Cdc42G12V formed protrusive processes , whereas CECs expressing dominant negative Cdc42T17N demonstrated stress fiber formation in polygonal cells . We further demonstrated the elongated cells with protrusive process are actively involved in cell migration . We conclude that the organization of actin cytoskeleton in response to FGF-2 stimulation is an orderly event disruption of stress fibers is prerequisite to cortical actin formation , which is followed by the formation of protrusive processes . It is likely that these elongated cells with prominent protrusive processes may represent the wound phenotypes that are actively involved in migration into the injury sites . Thus , Cdc42 appears to be involved in the final stage of actin cytoskeleton reorganization necessary for the endothelial to mesenchymal transformation of CECs . On the other hand , corneal endothelium in vivo organizes actin at the cortex Lee and Kay , 2003 the FGF-2 present in Descemet’s membrane probably facilitates the organization of actin cytoskel-eton at the cortex . Under physiological conditions , CECs in vivo maintain their polygonal cell shape with cortical actin under the minimal influence of FGF-2 . When injury-caused inflammation modulates the local concentration of FGF-2 , the FGF-2 is able to further exert its activities on Cdc42 , causing the polygonal cells to convert to spindle-shaped cells with prominent protrusive processes that may be responsible for the non-regenerative wound healing . 5 . FGF-2 its role in synthesis and secretion of type I collagen The physiologic collagen phenotypes of CECs are types IV and VIII collagen Kay et al. , 1984a but CECs also synthesize type I collagen , which is intracellularly degraded immediately after synthesis Ko and Kay , 2001 . Such intracellular degradation of type I collagen in CECs is essential to maintain a healthy cornea because secretion of type I collagen into Descemet’s membrane would adversely affect corneal function . On the other hand , type I collagen is a major constituent in RCFM Kay et al. , 1982 . Our attempt to investigate how type I collagen becomes the major ECM component in RCFM tissue led us to the finding that FGF-2 regulates expression of type I collagen through the action of PI 3-kinase Ko and Kay , 2005 . When CECs were continuously maintained in FGF-2 for 3 passages , cells completely lost their contact-inhibited phenotypes and formed multi-layers of elongated cells these cells were designated transformed CECs Fig. 1B . The steady-state level of a1 I collagen RNA was greatly up-regulated through stabilization of the message in transformed CECs . Of interest , transformed CECs predominantly secreted homotrimeric type I collagen , [ a1 I ] 3 , with heterotrimeric type I collagen , [ a1 I a2 2 I ] , as a minor species . We further demonstrated that type I collagen in the transformed CECs was preferentially associated and colocalized with Hsp47 at Golgi , suggesting that the molecule is correctly targeted for the secretory pathway . PI 3-kinase inhibitor reduced the steady-state levels and stability of a1 I and a2 I collagen RNAs and the secretion of type I collagen . These findings indicate that FGF-2 is able to completely switch the collagen phenotypes from basement membrane to fibrillar collagen and that this action of FGF-2 is mediated by PI 3-kinase . 6 . IL-1b its role in production of FGF-2 Corneal fibrosis represents a significant pathophysiological problem that causes blindness by physically blocking light trans-mittance . RCFM is believed to represent an end-stage disease process of the corneal endothelium that can lead to corneal opacity and blindness . We reported that activated PMNs transform the type IV collagen-synthesizing polygonal endothelial cells Kay et al. , 1984a to type I collagen-synthesizing fibroblastic cells and that PMNs release a 17-kDa protein Kay et al. , 1984b . Using Protein-Chip Array technology , we identified the protein obtained from the activated PMNs as IL-1b Lee et al. , 2004 . IL-1b is a major proinflammatory cytokine that plays an important role in acute and chronic inflammatory diseases Dinarello , 2009 , including inflammation and wound healing on the ocular surface Kimura et al. , 2009 . One well-known role of IL-1b is its stimulation of the expression of a variety of genes necessary for the wound repair process . Both IL-1a and IL-1b markedly stimulate synthesis and release of FGF-2 in various cells Cronauer et al. , 1999 . Likewise , CECs produce all isoforms of FGF-2 in response to IL-1b stimulation through the PI 3-kinase pathway with p38 as a downstream effector Lee et al. , 2004 Lee and Kay , 2009 . We further showed that such is the case in vivo using a transcorneal freeze injury model Song et al. , 2010 . Transcorneal freezing on rabbit eyes facilitates infiltration of PMNs , which subsequently release IL-1b into the aqueous humor . Production of all isoforms of FGF-2 is observed in corneal endothelium immedi-ately following transcorneal freezing , and such production is maintained for 48 h after the injury . Simultaneously , transcorneal freezing disrupts the actin cytoskeleton at the cortex , and cell shapes are altered from cobblestone to irregular shape . Blockade of PI 3-kinase p38 pathways reverses the altered actin cytoskeleton and cell shape . Taken together , it is likely that IL-1b initiates the endothelial to mesenchymal transformation of CECs through its inductive activity on FGF-2 , a direct mediator of EMT . 7 . Central role of PI 3-kinase We have shown the evidence that CECs predominantly utilize PI 3-kinase pathways during endothelial to mesenchymal trans-formation Fig. 2 . We also showed that IL-1b released by PMNs induces FGF-2 production through the PI 3-kinase pathway Fig. 2 . A marked increase of PI 3-kinase activity was observed in CECs stimulated with IL-1b for 10 min Lee et al. , 2004 . Such a rapid activation of PI 3-kinase leads to up-regulation of FGF-2 synthesis a threefold increase in FGF-2 production was observed in CECs treated with IL-1b for 1 h , after which the levels of FGF-2 were further increased in a time-dependent manner 12-to 16-fold during 24-to 72-h stimulation . Then the IL-1b-induced FGF-2 employs totally different kinetics of PI 3-kinase activation delayed and sustained activation of PI 3-kinase is observed in all three phenotypes modulated by FGF-2 during EMT cell prolifera-tion , cell shape change , and induction of type I collagen synthesis . Thus intervention of both IL-1b-mediated and FGF-2-mediated pathways will provide the means to block EMT before inflamma-tion causes an irreversible change , such as endothelial origin RCFM . In both pathways , PI 3-kinase can be used as a potential therapeutic target . 8 . Clinical relevance of EMT and conclusion Descemet’s stripping endothelial keratoplasty DSEK has become widely accepted as the preferred method for treating endothelial dysfunction Banitt and Chopra , 2010 Price and Price , 2007 . Compared with standard penetrating keratoplasty , DSEK provides quicker visual rehabilitation and an improved safety profile with less immune rejection . In spite of widespread adoption of DSEK , graft failure has been recognized , and one of the DSEK failures is RCFM production , albeit at a low frequency Young et al. , 2009 . Thus , studying the mechanism of EMT is becoming even more important with the emergence of endothelial keratoplasty and the current main surgical approach to endothelial disease . References

Simi-larly , tumor-derived microvesicles have been shown to carry several surface determinants and mRNA and to transfer some of these determinants to monocytes [ 11 ] . Apoptotic bodies from irradiated Epstein–Barr virus EBV -carrying cell lines have been seen to transfer DNA to a variety of co-cultured cells and integrated , but not episomal , copies of EBV resulted in expression of the EBV-encoded genes EBER and EBNAI in recipient cells at high copy number [ 12 ] . Extracts from T lymphocytes containing transcription factorcomplexescould induce fibroblasts toexpresslymphoid genes [ 13 ] . Investigators have evaluated the protein and mRNA content of microvesicles . In a recent study , RNA [ 14 ] was extracted from endothelial progenitor cell-derived microvesicles and microarray carried out . They found a total of 298 transcripts . Our own work has shown the capacity of murine lung-derived microvesicles to alter the phenotype of murine marrow cells [ 15,16 ] vide infra . We have investigated the capacity of murine lung to alter the genetic phenotype of normal murine marrow cells . Using a co-culture system in which marrow cells were cultured across from normal or irradiated lungs , but sepa-rated from the lung by a cell impermeable 0.4 micron membrane , we found that marrow cells expressed lung-specific mRNA , as detected by real-time polymerase chain reaction RT-PCR . Here , co-cultured marrow cells ex-pressed surfactants A , B , C , and D , aquaporin-5 , and clara cell-specific protein after 2 or 7 days of co-culture [ 15,16 ] . Conditioned media from lungs mediated the same genetic phenotype in incubated marrow cells , and we demonstrated that pelleted microvesicles had high levels of lung-specific mRNA . Incubation of marrow cells with fluorescence acti-vated cell sorting-isolated lung-derived microvesicles also induced marked elevations of lung-specific mRNA and entry of the microvesicles into a minority of the marrow cells . Marrow cells co-cultured across from lungs also showed an increased capacity to convert to lung cells after transplantation into irradiated hosts , indicating that the induced mRNA caused functional changes in the marrow cells . Recent studies [ 16 ] showing that actinomycin and alpha-amanitin affects these phenotype shifts suggested that transcriptional mechanisms were involved in the finally observed genetic phenotype . This was essentially estab-lished , using cross species cultures of rat lung and mouse marrow with species-specific primers for rat and mouse surfactants B and C. When rat lung was cultured opposite mouse marrow , the induced surfactant mRNA was both rat and mouse . Further study of murine lung-derived micro-vesicles has shown the presence of both protein and micro-RNA . A working hypothesis here is that both lung-specific mRNA and a protein transcription factor are transferred to cells via microvesicles . In addition , transferred microRNA may , in turn , modulate mRNA levels . These observations formed the basis for studies on the capacity of cancers derived from human lung to mediate phenotypic changes in target human marrow cells . We have used the same co-culture system as used for our murine studies , culturing specimens of human lung cancer , from operative samples , across from freshly harvested normal human marrow cells , but separated from them by a 0.4 micron cell impermeable membrane . Alternatively , we exposed human marrow cells to conditioned media from the cancers or to microvesicles derived from the lung cancers . We then evaluated the induction of lung-specific mRNA in the marrow cells by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction RT-PCR analysis . Materials and methods Tumor collection Consent was obtained according to Rhode Island Hospital’s Committee on Protection of Human Subjects Institutional Review Board for each of the patients involved . Tumors were surgically removed and taken to the Pathology Department for processing . A sample of each tumor was then brought to our laboratory for use in the present study . The sample was weighed and finely minced with a sterile scalpel into approxi-mately one cm2 pieces . Bone marrow cells Bone marrow was obtained from healthy volunteers with informed consent as per the Institutional Review Board . Bone marrow cells used in this study were either 1 whole unseparated bone marrow cells 2 Ficoll-separated bone marrow cells isolated by a Ficoll-Paque Premium GE Healthcare , Uppsala , Sweden density gradient according to the manufacturer’s instructions and 3 bone marrow cells with red blood cells removed using an ammonium chloride-based ACL2 lysis buffer BD Pharm Lyse lysing buffer , Becton Dickinson , Franklin Lakes , NJ , USA according to the manufacturer’s instructions . Co-culture Experiments were performed using six well plates BD Falcon , San Jose , CA , USA plated with 3 106 bone marrow cells per well . Fifty to 100 mg of minced tumor was placed into a Millipore 0.4 um Millicell Culture plate insert Millipore , Billerica , MA , USA with 3 mL of growth media consisting of Delbecco’s Modified Eagles Medium Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA , USA sup-plemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum Hyclone , South Logan , UT , USA , 1 % penicillin streptomycin Invitrogen , and 20 ng mL human stem cell factor R D Systems , Minneapolis , MN , USA . Control wells were cultured with equal numbers of bone marrow cells plated without tumor cell inserts . Co-cultures were main-tained for 2 or 7 days at 5 % CO2 at 37 C . In the case of condi-tioned media , tumor pieces were cultured without bone marrow cells and , after 7 days of culture , the cell-free conditioned media was removed and cultured with 3 106 bone marrow cells for an additional 7 days . Isolation of lung tumor microvesicles Microvesicles were isolated from cell-free conditioned media after 2 or 7 days of culture . The conditioned media was first centrifuged at 300 g for 10 min at 4 C . The supernatant was then ultracen-trifuged UCF at 28,000 g for 1 hour at 4 C in a Thermo Scien-tific Sorval WX Ultra series ultracentrifuge Thermo Scientific , Waltham , MA , USA . This spin was repeated , and the resulting pellet re-suspended in one Dulbecco’s phosphate-buffered saline PBS Invitrogen .

An equal volume of 10 % fetal bovine serum solution in PBS was added and the samples were UCF as before . The UCF pellet was either resuspended in growth media and co-cultured with bone marrow cells , or further pro-cessed for electron microscopy . Transmission electron microscopy The UCF pellets were fixed with 3 % glutaraldehyde in 0.15 M sodium cacodylate buffer Electron Microscopy Sciences , Hat-field , PA , USA for several days at 4 C. Following several rinses , the samples were post-fixed in 1 % osmium tetroxide Electron Microscopy Sciences for 1 hour at 4 C . After post-fixation , samples were diced in 1.5 mm cubes and covered with a 3 % agar solution Electron Microscopy Sciences . Once hardened , excess agar was removed and the sample was dehydrated through a graded series of acetone washes and embedded in Spurr’s epoxy resin Ladd Research Industries , Williston , VT , USA . Semi-thin sections 1 mm were prepared using a Reichert Ultracut-S micro-tome , stained with methylene blue–azure II , and evaluated for areas of interest . Ultra-thin sections were prepared , retrieved onto 300 mesh-thin bar copper grids , and contrasted with uranyl acetate and lead citrate Electron Microscopy Sciences . Sections were examined using a Morgagni 268-transmission electron microscope , and images were collected with an AMT-Advantage 542 CCD camera system Advanced Microscopy Techniques , Woburn , MA , USA . Fluorescence microscopy Bone marrow cells co-cultured for 2 days with isolated microve-sicles were harvested by gently rinsing the cells off the bottom of a T-75 tissue culture flask BD Falcon with PBS and spun at 300 g for 10 min at 4 C. Bone marrow cells containing fluorescent-labeled microvesicles were sorted on an Influx cell Table 1 .

Genes with lung specificity and their function Gene Name QP 1 Aquaporin 1 Surf A Surf B Surfactant B hTERT The RNA extraction and RT-PCR analysis The RNA from cultured or co-cultured bone marrow cells was isolated using the RNeasy Mini or QIAmp RNA Blood Mini Kit Qiagen , Valencia , CA , USA . The RNA was measured for quan-tity and quality 260 280 using a Nanodrop ND 1000 spectropho-tometer Thermo Scientific . Isolated RNA was used to amplify cDNA using High Capacity cDNA transcription kit Applied Bio-systems , Foster City , CA , USA in a final volume of 20 mL . The Surf C Surfactant C Surf D Surfactant D CCSP Clara specific cell protein Description amount of RNA used ranged from 10 ng to 500 ng however , equal amounts of RNA were used for all samples in any given experi-ment . Amplification reactions were run on a 9800 Fast Thermal Cycler Applied Biosystems and consisted of one cycle for 10 min at 25 C , two 60 min cycles at 37 C , and one cycle for 5 sec at 85 C. Gene expression was analyzed by RT-PCR in 96-well plates on a 7900 HT-Fast Real Time PCR System Applied Biosystems . The reactions were in a final volume of 25 mL consisting of 20 assay mix for either glyceraldehydes-3-phosphate dehydrogenase or one of the target genes , 2 TaqMan PCR Master Mix Applied Biosystems , and predetermined amounts of cDNA . All 20 assay mixes were purchased from Applied Biosystems . Human lung assays were as follows clara cell specific protein CCSP , Hs00171092_m1 , Surfactant A SURF A , Hs 00359837_m1 , Surfactant B SURF B , Hs 01090667_m1 , Surfactant C SURF C , Hs 00161628_m1 , Surfactant D SURF D , Hs 00427523_m1 , Aquaporin 1 AQP1 , Hs 00166067_m1 , Aquaporin 3 AQP3 , Hs 00185020_m1 , Aquaporin 4 AQP4 , Hs 00242342_m1 , Aquaporin 5 AQP5 , Hs 00387048_m1 , hTERT Hs 00972646_m1 , and glyceralde-hydes-3-phosphate dehydrogenase Hs 99999905_m1 . The PCR reaction consisted of an initial enzyme activation step at 95 C for 10 min , followed by 40 cycles of 95 C for 15 sec , and 60 C for 1 min . A cycle threshold CT value was obtained for each sample , and triplicate sample values were averaged . The 2-DDT method was used to calculate relative expression of each target gene . Briefly , mean CT value of target genes in each sample were normalized to its averaged housekeeping gene CT to give a DCT value . This was then normalized to the control samples DDCT , and the 2-DDT value was obtained . To calculate 2-DDT for target genes with no expression in the control group , a CT value of 40 was assigned to the control group so that a relative quantity of the target gene could be reported . The control group used for all comparisons was bone marrow cells co-cultured without lung tumor , conditioned media , or microvesicles for the same duration as the experimental groups . Statistics Data were analyzed using the Wilcoxon rank sum test . We consid-ered results to be statistically significant only when p 0.05 two-sided . Results The co-culture system is illustrated in Figure 1 . Fifty to 100 mg of lung tissue was co-cultured opposite 3 106 human bone marrow cells for 2 or 7 days , and real-time RT-PCR analysis was then performed on co-cultured marrow cells . Clinical samples were obtained from patients undergoing a variety of procedures to obtain tissue for diagnostic purposes . In most cases , the patients were undiagnosed . Informed consent was obtained and , after the Pathology Department obtained appropriate diagnostic material , aliquots of tumor tissue were provided for our experimental studies . The patients in this study had a variety of non-small-cell lung cancers 1 patient had a lung melanoma , and 1 patient had a lung sarcoma . These patients also had a variety of comorbid medical conditions which could influ-ence microvesicle generation . In addition , 2 patients had a history of bladder carcinoma , 1 patient had a history of Hodgkin’s lymphoma , and 1 patient was undergoing treat-ment for chronic lymphocytic leukemia . Patient demo-graphics are outlined in Table 1 . We selected genes with relative specificity except for hTERT for lung cells . They are listed with a brief descrip-tion of function in Table 2 . The results shown in Figure 2 summarize gene expres-sion of marrow cells co-cultured with minced lung tumor tissue . Gene expression was considered positive if it was over twofold greater than that of control cells . In these experiments , co-cultured marrow cells demonstrated varied expression of lung-specific genes , but in every case there was expression of at least one of these genes . In co-cultures with tumor from patient # 4 non-small-cell carcinoma , after 2 days of co-culture , whole bone marrow cells showed increased expression of AQP1 , 3 , and 5 , and SURF C , while Ficoll marrow cells showed increased expression of AQP1 and SURF D. Conversely , after 2 days of co-culture , the ACL2 sample showed expression of SURF B and SURF D. These were not seen in the 7-day co-culture samples . The SURF D expression persisted in the 7-day co-cultured Ficoll marrow cells . Marrow cells co-cultured with adenocarcinomas showed similar variation in gene expression as did co-cultures with other tumors . Marrow cells co-cultured with conditioned media and mi-crovesicles for 7 days Fig. 3A , B expressed elevated levels of lung-specific genes however , levels varied from sample to sample . Under different co-culture conditions and using different marrow cell preparations , marrow cells co-cultured with all of the lung-derived cancer samples showed increased expression of between one and seven lung-specific genes , with a range of expression of up to O1,000-fold . Patients # 11 and # 12 had lung melanoma and sarcoma , respectively . Marrow cells co-cultured with these tumors also expressed lung-specific genes . The most consistently expressed lung-specific genes were AQP1 10 patients and SURF B 9 patients , while AQP 4 was only expressed in co-cultures derived from 2 patient tumor samples . Co-cultures derived from different patient tumor samples expressed a different number of lung-specific genes patient # 8 , 7 genes patients # 4 and # 5 , 5 genes patient # 13 , 1 gene . Altogether , expres-sion of lung-specific genes in co-cultured marrow cells was statistically significant p 0.02 . Figure 4 shows marrow cells which have taken up PKH26 red fluorescence and CFSE green fluorescence -labeled microvesicles isolated from lung tumor tissue mela-noma from patient # 11 Fig. 4A–C . Figure 4D represents a marrow cell which did not take up microvesicles . Figure 5 shows transmission electron microscopy of vesicles isolated from lung tumor tissue adenocarcinoma from patient # 8 Fig. 5A–C and reveals that they have a morpho-logic appearance consistent with microvesicles . The hema-toxylin and eosin stained pathology is shown in Figure 5D . Discussion The present work is the first to show microvesicle evolution from explant fresh human lung cancer cells and microve-sicle transfer of genetic phenotype to human marrow cells . In these studies , we have shown that cells from 12 lung-derived cancers induced lung-specific mRNA in target marrow cells , either by tissue co-culture with cells separated by a 0.4 mm-cell impermeable membrane , by incubation in conditioned media , or by exposure to pelleted microvesicles . These lung-specific mRNA increases , com-pared to control marrow cells , varied from each tumor co-culture , but all 12 cancers induced between one and seven of the designate lung-specific genes p 0.02 . Increased expression of AQP1 was seen in 10 tumor co-culture samples and AQP4 in two samples . There was similar variability with the surfactant genes SURF A was expressed in three of the tumor co-culture samples , SURF B in nine , SURF C in four , and SURF D in four . Increased expression of lung-specific mRNA in co-cultured marrow cells was seen with 2 or 7 day co-cultures , and co-culture with conditioned media for 7 days seemed to give the most robust expression . Expression of lung-specific mRNA in co-cultured marrow cells was also seen whether whole marrow , ammonium chloride lysed marrow , or Ficoll-separated marrow was evaluated . In general , tumors evaluated by pathology consisted predominantly of cancer cells , although contributions of microvesicles from associ-ated normal cells can not be excluded in these experiments . Microvesicles were identified in the pellet of an UCF condi-tioned media sample , and sizes ranged from those typical of exosomes to those typical of microvesicles . Finally , we also demonstrated that microvesicles purified by fluorescent staining and fluorescence activated cell sorting entered a minority of marrow cells . These data are strikingly similar to those we obtained studying mouse lung microvesicle alteration of mouse marrow genetic and functional phenotype [ 15,16 ] and , as with those studies , suggest that cancer cell phenotype might be exportable . It is of interest , but perhaps not too surprising , that marrow cells co-cultured with lung tumors , which turned out to be melanoma and sarcoma , expressed lung-specific genes . Marrow cells co-cultured with mela-noma expressed AQP5 and SURF D , while marrow cells co-cultured with sarcoma expressed AQP 1 and 2 and SURF B. We assume that this reflects lung microenviron-mental influences on the tumor situated in the lung . This raises interesting possibilities of bidirectional cross talk between cancers and the normal host tissue . Tumor-derived microvesicles were first noted in the 1970s [ 17 ] and , since this time , effects of normal or tumor cell-derived microvesicles on cancer cells or their environment have been noted to impact cell survival , escape of immune surveillance , degradation of extracellular matrix , angiogen-esis , and metastases . More recent work with a murine mela-noma model has shown that tumor-derived microvesicles can enhance metastatic potential of melanoma cells in vivo [ 18 ] . Work with human cancer cell lines has demon-strated the delivery of oncogenic epidermal growth factor receptor via microvesicles to cultured endothelial cells [ 19 ] , and microvesicles seem to be generated by human prostate [ 20 ] and colorectal cell lines [ 21 ] as well . A report by Skog et al. [ 22 ] , who studied human glioblastoma tissues obtained from surgical resections , showed release of micro-vesicles containing mRNA , microRNA , and angiogenic proteins . These microvesicles were taken up by normal host cells , including brain microvascular endothelial cells . Furthermore , mRNA mutant variants and microRNAs char-acteristic of gliomas could be detected in microvesicles iso-lated from the serum of glioblastoma patients . Studies by Wysoczynski and Ratajczak [ 23 ] showed that both human and murine lung cancer cell lines secrete microvesicles , and that secretion was increased by irradiation and hypoxia . These tumor-derived microvesicles enhanced metastatic potential of both murine and human lung cancer cells in vivo . Our studies extend these observations to human explant lung cancer and show entrance of lung cancer-derived microvesicles into human marrow cells . They also indicate that this seems to be a universal phenomenon with lung cancers . The variability in lung cancer gene expression could be related to different conditions in specific experiments and the different tumors under study . The relative stability of genetic cellular phenotype has been a staple of both cell and cancer biology . Our previous work with normal murine lung and marrow cell [ 15,16 ] , and the present work with excised human lung cancer and human marrow , suggest that the systems are less stable than previously considered . The implications of this work are that lung cancer cells might alter blood cells or other normal cells toward a cancer cell phenotype . The possi-bility of stable alteration of genetic phenotype of normal cells by cancer cells introduces a number of potentially important concepts . The possible alteration of a normal cell to a neoplastic phenotype could be a means of local recurrence , progression , or distant dissemination . The observation that cancer tissue can alter the phenotype of adjacent normal marrow cells as shown here , and that these alterations may be due to transfer of cancer-derived micro-vesicles is , of course , a first step . The patient population in this study had many comorbid conditions including 4 patients with history of other cancers . The variables here are quite large and probably do influence the gene-ration of microvesicles in this experimental setting . In addi-tion , the excised cancer tissue studied will have associated normal lung cells . The possibility of a contribution by normal cells to the target cell phenotype can not be ruled out , although given the pathology of the specimens which are largely tumor cells , this seems less likely .

21871595	Osteoarthritis OA is the most common form of arthritis and is associated with a large health economic burden.1 The sibling recurrence risk ls for OA has been estimated to be approximately 5 in the UK.1 Two loci GDF5 [ MIM 601146 ] on chromosome 20 and a signal on chromosomal region 7q22 , both with allelic odds ratios of ~1.15 have reached genome-wide significance in European popula-tions.2–5 This paucity of established risk loci could be ascribed to limitations caused by insufficient sample sizes , phenotype heterogeneity , resolution of known variation , associations with low-frequency and or rare variants , interaction effects , or structural variation.6,7 We recently carried out a large genome-wide association scan GWAS restricted to knee and or hip OA and detected no repli-cating signals arcOGEN GWAS .8 Imputation based on the 1000 Genomes Project 1KGP has been proposed as an approach that will increase power and resolution in genetic association studies , 9 and researchers have already applied the technique to fine map known association signals.10,11 In this work , we applied a 1KGP-based imputa-tion and identify a genome-wide significant locus for OA within a gene previously unlinked to the disease . We used 1KGP pilot 1 data of 60 CEU individuals as a reference set and imputed 1KGP-identified variants into the arcOGEN GWAS of 3177 cases and 4894 UK con-trols12–14 Figure 1 . The set of 3177 OA cases are unrelated individuals of European ancestry collected in the UK on the basis of two criteria 1 radiographic evidence of disease defined as a Kellgren-Lawrence [ KL ] grade R 215 and or 2 clinical evidence of disease requiring joint replacement TJR . The 4894 UK-population-based con-trols were unrelated individuals from the 1958 British Figure 2 , Table 1 . We subsequently took this signal forward to de novo genotyping in two further sample sets from the UK the Genetics of Osteoarthritis and Life-style GOAL study16,17 1686 total joint replacement cases , 743 non-OA controls and an additional indepen-dent set of 2409 newly recruited arcOGEN cases and 2319 population-based controls from the 58BC and UKBS cohorts . The combined UK meta-analysis n ? 12,437 cases , 14,111 controls allelic OR was 1.22 [ 1.14– 1.30 ] , p ? 2.24 3 10 8 . We further investigated associa-tion with this variant in four non-UK OA sample sets two from the Netherlands Rotterdam Study I [ RSI ] , 1950 cases and 3243 controls , and Rotterdam Study II [ RSII ] , 485 cases and 1460 controls , both in silico , 18–20 one sample set from Estonia Estonian Genome Center , University of Tartu [ EGCUT ] , 2617 cases and 2619 controls , de novo genotyping , 21,22 and one from Iceland deCODE , 1552 cases and 3071 controls , de novo geno-typing . We used a meta-analysis framework to combine results across the follow-up studies only and across all data . We obtained the combined estimates of ORs for reference alleles by weighting the logORs of each study by the inverse of their variance via a fixed effects model . We investigated evidence of heterogeneity of ORs by using the Cochran’s Q and I2 statistics . The meta-analysis was performed with the GWAMA software package.23 In all seven follow-up datasets combined , rs11842874 was asso-ciated with OA with p ? 3.0 3 10 5 allelic OR 1.13 [ 1.07– 1.20 ] . Combined with the discovery sample set , the over-all fixed effects meta-analysis across 19,041 cases and 24,504 controls established association at this variant with p ? 2.07 3 10 8 allelic OR 1.17 [ 1.11–1.23 ] Figure 2 , Table 1 . The variant appears to be more strongly associ-ated with knee OA allelic OR 1.17 [ 1.10–1.25 ] , p ? 2.52 3 10 6 , effective sample size of 28,987 than with hip OA allelic OR 1.11 [ 1.03–1.19 ] , p ? 3.54 3 10 3 , effective sample size of 27,452 . Studies contributing data to this manuscript acquired informed consent from all participants and were approved by the appropriate ethics committee s for the respective institutions and countries . rs11842874 is one of several highly correlated SNPs at 13q34 and constitutes the observed association signal , which spans 12.7 kb Figure 3 . The surrounding 1 Mb region is characterized by low levels of linkage disequilib-rium and contains only nine SNPs correlated with rs11842874 at r2 0.7 . rs11842874 was selected for repli-cation because it is the only variant present on some GWAS platforms . The OA risk-increasing allele is the major allele with population frequency of 0.927 mean over the UK control data , and as a common variant with low OR , it contributes little to the sibling recurrence risk estimated ls ? 1.001 . All SNPs that comprise the signal reside in intron 4 of MCF2L MCF.2 cell-line-derived transforming sequence-like [ MIM 609499 ] , encoding the guanine nucle-otide exchange factor . Mcf2l studies in rat models of OA have shown expression in articular chondrocytes.24,25 In Closely examine signals with p10-5 and remove low quality variants Validate 6 promising imputed signals in the original GWAS samples Replicate 6 promising signals in 5,165 cases and 6,155 UK controls Replicate chr13 signal in 2 further sets of 4,095 cases and 3,062 UK controls Birth Cohort 58BC and the UK National Blood Donor Service UKBS and were obtained from an early release of the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium 2 WTCCC2 data . The genotyping and quality control QC of these individuals and their genotype data were described previously in the initial arcOGEN GWAS.8 Our primary 1KGP imputation was based on the April 2009 release of haplotypes for 57 individuals . After removing rare variants with minor allele frequency [ MAF ] 0.01 and SNPs with low imputation quality r2 0.3 , 7,258,070 variants were tested for association with OA . Further quality control was applied by closely examining all SNPs with p 10 5 in the association test , removing poorly clustering directly-typed SNPs in their vicinity up to 300 kb away , and repeating the imputation step with the August 2009 1KGP release of haplotypes from 56 individuals and reassessing evidence for association . We selected eight SNPs from six loci for validation in the original arcOGEN data and for de novo genotyping in independent follow-up sample sets Table S1 , available online . As part of our follow-up , we first genotyped an indepen-dent set of 5165 arcOGEN-collected cases and 6155 popu-lation-based controls from the 58BC and UKBS cohorts . Seven out of the eight SNPs were successfully typed with a Sequenom MassArray iPLEX Gold assay Table S1 and one SNP , rs11842874 on 13q34 , replicated with p ? 2.60 3 10 3 allelic odds ratio [ OR ] 1.17 [ 1.06–1.30 ] and with consistent effect direction as the original scan human cells MCF2L regulates neurotrophin-3-induced cell migration in Schwann cells.26 Neurotrophin-3 is a memberofthenervegrowthfactor NGF family.Treatment of knee OA patients with a humanized monoclonal anti-body that inhibits NGF was found to be associated with joint pain reduction and an improvement in func-tion.27,28 The MCF2L OA locus was taken forward on the basis of evidence accrued through 1KGP-based imputation . Direct typing of ~600,000 SNPs through GWAS resulted in modest p 10 5 evidence for the association of a single variant , rs11842874 , with OA in this region and HapMap-based imputation left the picture unchanged Figures 3A and 3B .

21873662	MYO7A Mutations PURPOSE . To determine the disease course in Usher syndrome type IB USH1B caused by myosin 7A MYO7A gene muta-tions . METHODS . USH1B patients n 33 , ages 2–61 representing 25 different families were studied by ocular examination , kinetic and chromatic static perimetry , dark adaptometry , and optical coherence tomography OCT . Consequences of the mutant alleles were predicted . RESULTS . All MYO7A patients had severely abnormal ERGs , but kinetic fields revealed regional patterns of visual loss that suggested a disease sequence . Rod-mediated vision could be lost to different degrees in the first decades of life . Cone vision followed a more predictable and slower decline . Central vision ranged from normal to reduced in the first four decades of life and thereafter was severely abnormal . Dark adaptation kinetics was normal . Photoreceptor layer thickness in a wide region of central retina could differ dramatically between patients of comparable ages and there were examples of severe losses in childhood as well as relative preservation in patients in the third decade of life . Comparisons were made between the mutant alleles in mild versus more severe phenotypes . CONCLUSIONS . A disease sequence in USH1B leads from gener-ally full but impaired visual fields to residual small central islands . At most disease stages , there was preserved temporal peripheral field , a potential target for early phase clinical trials of gene therapy . From data comparing patients’ rod disease in this cohort , the authors speculate that null MYO7A alleles could be associated with milder dysfunction and fewer photo-receptor structural losses at ages when other genotypes show more severe phenotypes . Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci . 2011 52 7924–7936 DOI 10.1167 iovs.11-8313 Tdrome he understanding of mechanisms underlying Usher syn-USH has increased in recent years with the iden - USH has increased in recent years with the iden-tification of the molecular bases of the diseases reviewed in Refs . 1–3 . The original clinical subcategories are now known to be caused by many different genes , and most of the gene products are postulated to play roles in an Usher protein network located in the region of the connecting cilium of the photoreceptor.3–5 All forms of USH , by definition , lead to retinal degeneration , although some of the USH-causing genes can also cause nonsyndromic deafness.1 USH1B , the most common form of USH1 , is caused by mutations in MYO7A myosin 7A . Like most of the other forms of USH , there is no murine model with a retinal degeneration phenotype.1,6,7 The onus is thus placed on noninvasive human studies in patients with clarified genotypes to help define the retinal degenerative disease component of the syndrome . Given the prospect of therapy for USH1B , 8 we have initiated studies to characterize in detail the retinal phenotype of USH patients with known genotypes . We first inquired in USH1B and in other USH genotypes about the earliest detectable site of disease and concluded that it was the photoreceptor.9 Then , we explored the microstructure of the central retina of USH1B patients using high-resolution optical coherence tomogra-phy.10 An unexpected result was that many patients showed a wide central region of structurally and functionally normal retina . This observation led to suggestions about candidate sites for treatment as well as retinal sites that would be ill-advised to treat in early safety trials . The finding of normal central retina in syndromic recessive retinal degenerations was extended recently to include USH1C11 and nonsyndromic ret-initis pigmentosa.12 Patterns of visual function have been published for various USH clinical and molecular subtypes for example , Refs . 13– 19 . In the only previous study of USH1B , cross-sectional and longitudinal data for functional vision scores were analyzed , and deterioration rates were compared with those from USH2A.17 To increase the knowledge base of the USH1B phe-notype in anticipation of clinical trials , we studied visual acu-ities , kinetic and chromatic static perimetry , and retinal imag-ing in a molecularly clarified group of USH1 patients with MYO7A mutations to determine the patterns of central , periph-eral , and rod-and cone-based visual disturbances . A recent report of visual cycle abnormalities in Myo7a-deficient mice20 Investigative Ophthalmology Visual Science , October 2011 , Vol . 52 , No. 11 Copyright 2011 The Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology , Inc . also prompted us to study the kinetics of dark adaptation in some USH1B patients with preserved rod function . Once it became clear that there were milder as well as more severe phenotypes , we inquired whether the genotypes of the differ-ent phenotypes could help to explain the variation in disease expression among patients . METHODS Human Subjects Optical Coherence Tomography OCT RESULTS Clinical Characteristics of the USH1B Patients In this cohort of 33 USH1B patients , representing 25 families , there were 8 sibling pairs Table 1 . Two sibling pairs P7 , P9 and P11 , P12 were not known to be from the same family , but both pairs were from the Dominican Republic and all were homozygous for the c.999T C , p.Y333X allele . Origins of the remainder of the patients were mainly European Table 1 . Severe bilateral hearing impairments were reported to be pres-ent by early childhood in all the patients . Visual acuities in the first two decades of life were no worse than 20 63 . In later decades of life , visual acuity could also be preserved in at least one eye , and only the oldest patient in the study P33 , age 61 had worse than 20 200 acuity in both eyes .

Electroretinograms were performed in 20 of the 33 patients . Only one patient P26 , age 19 had detectable rod ERG b-waves , and these were 5 % of normal mean amplitude . Cone flicker ERGs were detectable in 11 of 20 patients , and these waveforms ranged from 1 % to 10 % of mean normal amplitude . Patterns of Visual Loss by Kinetic Perimetry Kinetic visual fields with V-4e , the large bright target , were measurable in 25 patients most young patients were unable to perform the test , and the oldest patient had no detectable kinetic field Table 1 . Twenty-three of the patients were able to detect I-4e , the small bright target . A normal extent of kinetic field in response to the V-4e target defined as 90 % Ref. 21 was present in only six patients . None of the patients had a normal extent of kinetic field with the I-4e target . Different patterns of kinetic visual field abnormalities were evident with the V-4e target in cross-sectional data . A sequence leading through several patterns was suggested by the longitu-dinal data available in some patients Fig. 1A . A full extent of field with V-4e and no detectable absolute scotomas , albeit with only a small central island using I-4e , was designated pattern I. P9 , P11 , and P12 at ages 6 to 11 exemplify this pattern . At the other end of the severity spectrum , there were fields with only a residual small central island of function with V-4e these were considered pattern V. Pattern II shows nasal field loss and in pattern III , there were complete or incom-plete midperipheral absolute scotomas . Pattern IVa showed a nearly complete annular midperipheral scotoma separating a central island from a temporal peripheral island further reduc - tion of central and peripheral islands was designated pattern IVb . Longitudinal data through at least three of the patterns are shown for P12 I–IVa , P11 I–III , and P24 II , IVa–IVb . Data through two patterns are shown for P9 I and III , P25 IVb–V , P19 and P20 IVa–IVb , and P32 and P18 IVb–V . Kinetic field data for all the patients and all visits are shown organized by pattern of disease and age at the time the perim-etry was performed Fig. 1B . Patterns I to IVa were present mainly in the first two decades of life pattern I mean 10.9 years , range 6–19 II mean 16.3 years , range 13–20 III mean 16 years , range 15–17 and IVa mean 18.6 years , range 11–24 . The average age of patients in patterns IVb and V tended to be older IVb mean 26.5 years , range 16–41 , and V mean 37 years , range 28–49 than those in earlier patterns . Light-Adapted Visual Function in USH1B The kinetic visual field extent , quantified for the V-4e target and expressed as a percent of normal mean , is plotted against age Fig. 2A longitudinal data are indicated by lines connect-ing symbols . There is a range of visual field loss in the first two decades of life after the third decade , only approximately 10 % or less of the visual field remains . The decline with age could be described by a log-linear relationship with a decay rate of 14 % per year half-life , 4.6 years with longitudinal data rep-resenting the average of individual rates for 14 patients with follow-up intervals between 5 and 15 years . When the cross-sectional data and the first visit of each patient were used , the decay rate was 10 % per year . Static threshold perimetry in the light-adapted state 600-nm stimulus was performed in 22 of the patients . Cone sensitivity maps across the visual field are shown for two USH1B patients ages 12 and 39 to illustrate extremes of visual dysfunction Fig. 2B , left . Patient 9 at age 12 has normal central cone function extracentral loci with detectable function showed 1 to 2 log units of loss . Patient 32 age 39 had detectable cone sensitivity only at the central locus . Data from all patients are summarized as the extent of cone visual field Fig. 2B , right , for comparison with data from kinetic perimetry . The extent of cone field was defined as the number of loci with detectable function expressed as a percentage of the total number of loci analyzed . Cone field extent showed a decline with age that could be described by a log-linear relationship with a decay of 11 % per year half-life , 5.9 years , using longitudinal data representing the average of individual rates for 11 patients with follow-up intervals between 2 and 15 years . When cross-sectional data and the first visit of each patient were used , the decay rate was 10.5 % per year . Central cone function was assessed with visual acuity and central static profiles using 600-nm stimuli , light adapted . Best corrected visual acuity for USH1B in the first two decades of life varied between 20 20 logMAR 0.0 and 20 63 logMAR 0.49 individuals studied longitudinally during that interval showed progressive reduction in acuity Fig. 2C . Data were limited after the third decade of life but some individuals retained relatively high visual acuity levels whereas others declined . Static perimetry results in the central retina are illustrated in three patients , ages 28 to 31 years , showing there could be differences in central function in patients at similar ages Fig. 2D , left . The summary of cone sensitivities across the central retina 8° of all patients , like the visual acuity results , showed that some patients retained normal sensitivity over three decades of life , whereas others had early losses Fig. 2D , right . In summary , there was a definable relationship of cone function with age , measured by parameters that included the peripheral and central retina . Central visual function measured independently of peripheral function was more variable . Differences in Rod Functional Deficits among USH1B Patients Maps of dark-adapted sensitivity to a 500-nm target and photo-receptor mediation at each of the loci with detectable function based on two-color , dark-adapted perimetry with 500-and 650-nm stimuli are illustrated Fig. 3A , left . Patient 26 age 19 had a substantial extent of normal central rod function but there was midperipheral and peripheral rod sensitivity loss of 2 to 2.8 log units . At a comparable age , patient 27 age 21 had no detectable rod function and only cone-mediated func-tion . Summaries of rod-mediated sensitivities across the visual field of all patients are plotted as a function of age Fig. 3A , right . The extent of rod visual field was defined as the number of loci mediated by rods with 3.0 log units of sensitivity loss and expressed as a percentage of the total number of loci analyzed . There were considerable differences among patients in measurable rod visual field extent in the first three decades of life . Seven patients retained at least 33 % of rod visual field extent , whereas nine patients had 3 % . By the fourth decade , rod field extent had diminished to 10 % or less in all patients . Limited longitudinal data in four patients P9 , P11 , P20 , and P24 suggested progression rates ranging from 11 % to 24 % per year of reduction in rod visual field extent . Rod-mediated vision in USH1B was also studied within the central field , excluding the fovea Fig. 3B . Rod sensitivity could be within normal limits in some individuals for almost the first three decades of life , whereas others showed very reduced or nondetectable rod sensitivity at comparable ages Fig. 3B , left . For example , three USH1B patients , ages 17 to 21 , have contiguous central regions of normal rod sensitivity Fig. 3B , left . The pattern of markedly reduced rod sensitivity or only cone-mediated sensitivity is illustrated by P13 at age 19 and P27 at age 21 . Cross-sectional and longitudinal rod data plotted as a function of age Fig. 3B , right suggest that within the first two to three decades of life , the central field , like rod visual field extent measured across the entire field Fig. 3A , can show different severities of rod disease . Evidence of abnormalities in the visual cycle in the shaker1 mouse model of USH1B20 prompted a study of kinetics of dark adaptation in patients . Chromatic sensitivities were measured before and after a desensitizing light flash in P7 , P9 , and P21 Fig. 3C , 3D . In all patients , a retinal locus at 4o in the superior field was tested . P9 at age 17 showed rod sensitivities that were within 0.5 log unit of normal . Within a minute after the end of the light-adapting exposure , visual function was detectable , and it was mediated by the cone system . Cone-mediated func - tion was normal and remained on the plateau for approxi-mately 8 minutes , similar to the 7 to 9 minutes in normal eyes . Rod function then became detectable and the shape and timing of the rod recovery function was normal Fig. 3C . P21 at age 18 had 1.6 log units of sensitivity loss at the test locus . After the light-adapting exposure , cone function was detectable and reached a plateau with normal kinetics within 5 minutes , but there was 0.7 log unit of cone sensitivity loss . Rod function became measurable at 8.5 minutes and the time course of recovery to baseline appeared to have normal kinetics Fig. 3D . P7 , at age 9 years , showed 2 log units of rod sensitivity loss . The relatively young age of the patient prohibited the recording of as complete a dark adaptation function as in the older patients , but normal cone sensitivity was present before 9 minutes after the light-adapting exposure , and baseline rod levels were present after 45 minutes data not shown . Retinal Structural Differences in USH1B Structure of the central retina was recorded with SD-OCT along the vertical meridian crossing the anatomic fovea and quanti-fied in terms of the thickness of the laminae representing photoreceptor nuclei and inner outer segments Fig. 4 . Struc-turally normal retina and photoreceptors could be present across extensive regions of central retina e.g. , P2 and P4 , Fig. 4A or might be limited to a small region at and around the fovea P15 , Fig. 4A , implying a centripetal component to the progressive retinal degeneration . A superior–inferior asymme-try was also often observed the region of normal structure tended to extend farther into the superior retina compared with the inferior retina Fig. 4A , implying intraretinal anisot-ropy of constriction rates with disease progression . Superior to the fovea , the extent of normal photoreceptors plotted against age shows large interindividual differences in our cross-sectional sample of USH1B patients Fig. 4B . Differ-ences are especially notable in the first three decades of life . Some patients P1 , P2 , P3 , P4 , P7 , P24 , P26 , and P28 had normal retinal structure extending well into the rod ring39 where rod cone ratios peak at 20 , thus implying normal or near-normal rod photoreceptor density . Other patients in con-trast had normal photoreceptors limited only to the cone-dominated fovea and its immediate surrounds . Age was not a good predictor of disease extent , as demonstrated by SD-OCT scans from P7 at age 6 and P5 at age 5 , showing large differences in the extent of normal photoreceptor structure that were already present in the first decade of life . Similarly , P28 and P13 , both at age 21 , showed severity differences at the start of the third decade of life Fig . 4B , right . Inferior to the fovea , there was a tendency to have a smaller extent of normal structure than in the superior retina , and thus interindividual differences appeared smaller due to the “floor” effect Fig. 4C . Contributing to the superior–inferior asymmetry could be intraretinal differences in rod cone ra-tios which are significantly different at eccentricities of 3 to 4 mm from the fovea Figs . 4B , 4C . Next , we tried to understand through quantitation the nat-ural history of retinal structural changes in USH1B . Ideally , longitudinal measurements over decades provide the best es-timates of natural history of retinal disease , but SD-OCT tech-nique has been commercially available only recently . There-fore , we took advantage of our ONL thickness measurements from TD-OCTs in a subset of eight patients recorded longitu-dinally over an average of 6.9 years range , 3–11 . We hypoth-esized that the extent of normal ONL constricted along a delayed exponential trajectory in all patients . The rate of the exponential would be constant , but the delay would vary between patients , as has been described for several retinal function parameters in human retinal degenerations19,40–43 and retinal structure parameters in animal models of retinal degeneration.44 A simple exponential with a rate constant of 14.3 % per year fit the shifted ONL data from USH1B patients well Fig. 4D . Such an exponential progression would predict the initiation of retinal degeneration at 6 mm eccentricity superior to the fovea at or near birth in P5 , P7 , and P9 and at the ages of 17 , 15 , 24 , 15 , and 20 years in P18 , P20 , P24 , P29 , and P32 , respectively . Exponential functions with the 14.3 % per year rate constant but progressively delayed by one-decade intervals are plotted on the cross-sectional SD-OCT data Figs . 4B , 4C to show the predicted differences in the delay of disease initiation that could explain the interindividual differ-ences observed . Relationships between Phenotype and Genotype There were notable differences in rod vision among patients of the same age in the first two to three decades of life Fig. 3 and there were also differences in the extent of normal retina observed by cross-sectional imaging of the photoreceptor layer in the central retina Fig. 4 . Recognizing that USH1B is a progressive retinal degeneration , we assumed that these differ-ences in data acquired by cross-sectional studies were related to different rates of photoreceptor degeneration . An answer-able question is whether those with milder disease expression presumed slower natural history had a different genotype than those with more rapidly aggressive retinal degeneration . To try to answer the question , we chose pairs of patients with extreme differences at comparable ages those with normal rod sensitivities centrally Fig. 3B , right and age-related patients with at least 2 log units of rod sensitivity loss . The higher– lower sensitivity pairings by rod vision included sibling pairs P26 , P28 ages 19 , 21 versus sibling pair P21 , P27 ages 18 , 21 P20 age 17 versus P13 age 16 and P9 age 12 and P11 age 10 versus P15 age 10 . Retinal structural data extent of normal photoreceptor layer in the central retina yielded the following comparisons sibling pair P26 , P28 ages 19 , 21 ver-sus P13 age 21 . There were also differences in patients by OCT in the first decade of life e.g. , Fig 4B , right , but the different extents fell within the proposed rapidly progressive phase of the disease , which needs better definition by longitu-dinal studies . The predicted consequences of the mutant MYO7A alleles in all 33 patients are listed Table 2 and the bases of the predictions are explained Supplementary Text and Supple-mentary Figs . S1 , S2 , http www.iovs.org lookup suppl doi 10.1167 iovs.11-8313 -DCSupplemental . Among the five pa-tients with “milder” disease expressions were P9 and P11 , who would be predicted to have two null MYO7A mutations Y333X homozygous . P20 was a compound heterozygote with two mutations that were presumed nulls C31X and E495X . P26 and P28 of family 21 R634X heterozygous would have a single null mutation . The other point mutation in this family G1982E would be predicted to interfere with the structure of the second FERM domain in the MYO7A tail Supplement-ary Fig. S1 , http www.iovs.org lookup suppl doi 10.1167 iovs.11-8313 -DCSupplemental . This interference may not be as severe as most other mutations in this domain , however , since G1982 is present in a rather unstructured loop so that the mutation may not affect folding of the domain or interaction of the domain with the MyTH4 domain.45 Considering the four patients with “severe” disease expres-sion , P21 and P27 family 16 would have two alleles leading to a lack of a complete second FERM domain K1255fs , G1942X . P15 would be heterozygous for a mutation with similar pre-dicted consequence K1737fs and heterozygous for a splice acceptor site mutation that would result in aberrant splicing of exon 34 encoding the FERM1 domain 4442-2A C . Patient 13 had a point mutation that would affect a region without ho-mologous crystal structure . This mutation G955S would appear to interfere with the structure of the post alpha helical domain . The other mutation 2187 1G A is predicted to destroy the exon 18 splice donor site and result in aberrant splicing or truncation of the MYO7A neck region before the first IQ motif Table 2 Supplemen - tary Fig. S1 , http www.iovs.org lookup suppl doi 10.1167 iovs.11-8313 -DCSupplemental . DISCUSSION Genetic heterogeneity is a fact in Usher syndrome and focus has now shifted from gene discovery to pursuit of pathologic mechanisms.2,3 Hypotheses are now being tested experimen-tally to understand how the Usher proteins interact with each other and with other molecules.4,5 The prospect of clinical trials of treatment for these retinal diseases8 requires that we also move forward in the clinic from the classic three clinical USH subtypes3 to some greater understanding of how the different USH diseases are expressed . An estimate of natural history through cross-sectional data , for example , could help define when treatment would be appropriate . If a focal therapy is being considered , we should determine the location in the retina that would be safe and advantageous to target the treat-ment . The present study of a cohort of molecularly defined USH1B patients provides an opportunity to increase understanding of this common form of USH1 . Kinetic visual field abnormalities in the USH1B patients were able to be ordered in such a way as to suggest a sequence of visual field loss due to progression of the retinal degeneration . The visual fields in our USH1B patients without major losses resemble those previously de-scribed as pattern III in different forms of retinitis pigmen-tosa46 our patients , however , appeared to have a predilection for early loss of the nasal midperipheral field . The ordering of patterns in the present study suggested that peripheral tempo-ral field islands are retained until late stages of the disease . Considering the well-preserved central retina with normal structure and function in many USH1B patients , 10 we previ-ously speculated that focal treatment e.g. , subretinal gene delivery could occur in transition zones from normal to ab-normal retina adjacent to the central retina.10 Further results from the present study suggest that it may be even more prudent to begin focal treatment trials in the peripheral retina , assuming subretinal delivery is used . Subretinal injections of vector into the nasal retina of RPE65-LCA patients in our gene therapy clinical trial have proven safe clinicaltrials.gov , NCT00481546 . It is also conceivable , but awaits evidence , that those with only central islands remaining by kinetic pe-rimetry pattern V Fig. 1 could have detectable temporal peripheral islands , given different test paradigms that produce higher intensity stimuli than the standard kinetic perimeter.47 Cone-based static perimetry and light-adapted kinetic pe-rimetry showed similar results with age . On average , there was a slowly progressive loss of visual field extent of 10 % to 14 % per year . Our progression rate estimates in USH1B lie within the ranges of 8 % to 14 % per year reported in studies combining USH1 and USH2 patients15 or examining only USH2 pa-tients.16,19,48 Rod-mediated vision was less predictable . Some patients retained better rod function for a longer period of their lives than others , suggesting different natural histories of disease within USH1B . The limited longitudinal data in these patients indicated that there was progressive loss of rod func-tion . The observations may thus represent another example of different onset ages of visual loss , as has been demonstrated in other retinal degenerations.41 Further insight into rod differences in the USH1B patients was gained from cross-sectional images of the retina and mea-surements of photoreceptor laminae vertically across a wide expanse of central retina . We measured the vertical meridian to try to capture the superior retinal region with the rod “hot spot ” of high density of rod photoreceptors.39 Commonly in USH1B and other USH genotypes , 9,10 there is greater superior than inferior extent of ONL , which we attribute to the higher numbers of rod cells leading to an apparently slower rate of degeneration in this region . The longitudinal OCT data in the present cohort could be described by an exponential constric-tion of the central extent of normal photoreceptors corre-sponding to a rapidly progressive centripetal sweep of the disease boundary10 in the first few years of life from the midperiphery toward central regions . An invariant function of photoreceptor degeneration44 the onset of which is delayed as an exponential function of eccentricity could be the basis of the constriction observed . The 14 % per year rate of photo-receptor structure constriction along a single dimension im-plies 28 % per year constriction in terms of retinal area . Rod photoreceptor nuclei are the dominant contributors to the extrafoveal ONL thickness , and thus rod rather than cone vision may be expected to correlate closely with retinal struc-ture . Indeed , higher rates of progression were observed in terms of rod-mediated visual field extent compared with cone-mediated visual field extent , even though measurable rod data were available from a very limited number of USH1B patients . Previous studies of other USH genotypes have also shown higher rates of rod than cone progression.19 As the extent of normal photoreceptor laminae of the retina becomes reduced , the residual extent is in central regions that are normally relatively cone-rich lower rod cone ratio . From the second decade of life onward , most patients retained only a central island of normal photoreceptor layer thickness that continued to constrict at a slower pace . This disease stage is likely to be dominated mainly by cone loss . Not surprisingly , the patients who were outliers to the photoreceptor progres-sion model also showed greater retention of rod function measured psychophysically . Perfect overlap in the two data sets was not possible because psychophysical data were not available in young children , whereas OCT was able to be performed at all ages . More than a decade ago , it was suggested that there should be an attempt to relate visual measures in USH1B patients with specific mutations in the MYO7A gene.49 We acknowledge the complexity of USH syndromes at a molecular level and how difficult it may be to understand phenotype based on geno-type . For example , there is recent evidence that there are modifiers in some forms of USH , 50 and other ciliopathies , 51,52 and there are proposed interactions between USH proteins.2,3 Accepting the complexity , we still attempted to answer the question of whether there were any obvious differences in phenotype in patients within this USH1B cohort and whether there was any relation of these different phenotypes to the known or predicted consequences of their MYO7A mutations . It is noteworthy that patients with stop mutations within the coding region of the MYO7A motor domain tended to have relatively milder rod disease . Two alleles of shaker1 mice , Myo7a4494SB and Myo7a4626SB , contain stop mutations within the motor domain53 and have been found to be null muta-tions.54 Although fragments of the MYO7A motor domain thus appear to be unstable , truncated products that include a com-plete motor domain and are thus somewhat comparable to S1 or HMM myosin fragments are likely to be more stable . In contrast to the Myo7a4494SB and Myo7a4626SB mice , Myo7a3336SB mice , which have a C2182X mutation , 53 have significant levels of mutant MYO7A protein in their tis-sues.55 Polka mice possess a splicing mutation in Myo7a that results in loss of much of the FERM2 domain and the addition of 33 nonsense residues to the C terminus . These mice express mutant MYO7A at the normal level of wild-type protein in their retinas and brains.56 Cells in patients with mutations that affect only the MYO7A tail may there-fore contain significant levels of mutant MYO7A , which , especially in the absence of any wild-type protein , may contribute to the more severe disease observed in some of these patients . MYO7A protein with a highly perturbed or absent second FERM domain could be particularly deleteri-ous . This domain has been shown to be responsible for autoregulation of MYO7A activity , 57 as well as cargo binding that in turn promotes dimerization , which is necessary for progression along actin filaments.58 The presence of dys-functional MYO7A may interfere with other actin-related processes . Missense mutations in the region coding for the MYO7A motor , which in many cases perturb ATP or actin interaction , can also result in a stable dysfunctional protein . Indeed , mice that are heterozygous for the MYO7A point mutation , I178F , have been observed to have vestibular and cochlear defects , 59 indicating that dysfunctional MYO7A can have dominant-neg-ative effects .

21880100	Introduction The nuclear envelope is composed of inner and outer nuclear membranes INM and ONM , respectively . INM proteins can be important for spatial organiza-tion of chromosomes within the nucleus . A number of INM proteins have been identified in vertebrates Cohen et al. 2001 Holmer Worman 2001 Schir-mer et al. 2003 Schirmer Gerace 2005 Wilson Berk 2010 . Among them , LEM-domain proteins are a family of INM proteins that share the LEM Lap1 , emerin and Man1 domain of approximately 40 amino acid residues Lin et al. 2000 Laguri et al. 2001 Gruenbaum et al. 2005 Wagner Krohne 2007 . A member of the LEM-domain protein family , emerin , is known to be involved in laminopathy Cohen et al. 2001 Burke Stewart 2002 Holaska et al. 2002 Worman Bonne 2007 Tatiana et al. 2008 . Man1 is Communicated by Masayuki Yamamoto *Correspondence hiraoka @ fbs.osaka-u.ac.jp SUN-domain INM protein . Sad1 is primarily local-ized at the spindle-pole body SPB and is essential for mitotic cell growth Hagan Yanagida 1995 . Sad1 also has a role in telomere movement in meiosis Chikashige et al. 2006 . S. pombe Ima1 is another conserved INM protein identified as a protein homologous to rat NET5 King et al. 2008 . Rat NET5 is one of the 67 putative nuclear envelope transmembrane proteins NETs found in a large-scale proteomics analysis Schirmer et al. 2003 a human homologue has also been identified and named Samp1 Buch et al. 2009 . It is proposed that Ima1 links centromeres to Sad1 in S. pombe King et al. 2008 , but we found that the strains used were not deleted for the ima1 gene as we describe later . Although little is known about other INM proteins in S. pombe , its genome has two genes encoding LEM-domain proteins gene ID SPAC18G6.10 and SPAC14C4.05c . SPAC18G6.10 is homologous to human Lem2 Brachner et al. 2005 Ulbert et al . 2006 and Saccharomyces cerevisiae Heh2 King et al . 2006 SPAC14C4.05c is homologous to human Man1 Lin et al. 2000 and S. cerevisiae Heh1 King et al. 2006 . Therefore , we hereafter designate these respective genes lem2+ and man1+ in S. pombe S. Sazer , personal communication . In studying INM proteins in S. pombe , here , we focus on LEM-domain proteins Man1 and Lem2 , and another conserved INM protein Ima1 . All three proteins , Ima1 , Man1 and Lem2 , interact with Sad1 . Loss of any one of these proteins has no effect on mitotic cell growth , but loss of all three proteins causes severe defects in mitotic cell growth and nuclear membrane morphology . Thus , we propose that Ima1 collaborates with Man1 and Lem2 in the nuclear envelope , possibly through connections with Sad1 . Results Localization of Ima1 , Lem2 and Man1 in Schizosaccharomyces pombe cells We first determined localization of green fluorescent protein GFP -fusion products of Ima1 , Lem2 and Man1 in S. pombe cells . All three proteins were pri-marily localized to the nuclear envelope throughout the cell cycle with no apparent changes in fluores-cence intensity Fig. 1 . Besides localization at the nuclear envelope , Ima1 was also localized to the SPB as reported previously King et al. 2008 . We found that this SPB localization was observed only in a limited period of the cell cycle Ima1 accumulated to the SPB shortly before SPB separation and disap-peared at the end of anaphase Fig. 1A , B . Interest-ingly , Lem2 also showed accumulation at the SPB but only in the period of the cell cycle when Ima1 was not present at the SPB Fig. 1C . In contrast , no obvious accumulation of Man1 at the SPB was observed at any stages of the cell cycle Fig . 1D . Mitotic cell growth is defective in the absence of Ima1 , Lem2 and Man1 To elucidate the functions of Ima1 , Lem2 and Man1 , we deleted the respective coding genes individually and in combination . All three individual deletion mutants and most of the double deletion mutants were viable and showed no obvious defects in mitotic cell growth and nuclear morphology at all of the tem-peratures we tested Fig. 2A , B . In contrast , cells of an ima1D lem2D double deletion mutant showed slow growth and aberrant nuclear morphology at tempera-tures higher than 30 °C Fig. 2A , B . Nuclei were often enlarged and deformed Fig. 2B yellow arrows . The growth defect and abnormal nuclear morphology were strongly enhanced in ima1D lem2D man1D triple deletion cells . These results suggest that these three genes have at least partially redundant functions in the nuclear membranes . Consistent with this , yeast two-hybrid assay showed that Ima1 inter-acts with the LEM-domain INM proteins , and all three of the INM proteins interact with Sad1 Ima1 and Sad1 also interact with itself Fig. 2C . These results suggest that Ima1 , Lem2 and Man1 form a large interaction network that is pivotal for maintain-ing functional organization of the nuclear envelope . As severe growth defects in the triple deletion mutant made it difficult to examine its cellular phe-notypes in detail , we turned to examine phenotypes of the ima1D lem2D double deletion mutant at the restrictive temperature in further studies . Our above results were contradictory to a previous report showing that single gene disruption of ima1 causes defects in mitotic cell growth King et al. 2008 . In an attempt to solve this discrepancy , we noticed that the ima1D strain MKSP20 used in their study was not allelic to our ima1D strain HMP141 made independently in this study Fig. S1A in Sup-porting Information the MKSP20 strain retained the intact ima1 open reading frame ORF sequence at the ima1 locus Fig. S1B in Supporting Information and instead disrupted an unrelated ORF , SPAC11E3.05 , expressing a truncated product of this ORF Fig. S1C in Supporting Information . SPAC11E3.05 encodes the zf-C3HC4-type RING finger protein anno-tated as ubiquitin–protein ligase E3 . However , complete deletion of SPAC11E3.05 showed no defects in mitotic cell growth data not shown , sug-gesting that expression of a truncated product of SPAC11E3.05 may be a cause for the observed defects in the strain . As the previous report claimed that Ima1 has a role in linking centromeres to the SPB King et al. 2008 , we re-examined this proposed function using our ima1D deletion allele . To examine the connection between centromeres and the SPB , we observed the positions of centromeres and the SPB in cells dis-rupted for the ima1 or lem2 gene , or both . Centro-meres were visualized with lac operator sequences inserted close to the centromere of chromosome 2 in cells expressing LacI-GFP , and the SPB was visualized with Sid4 fused with monomeric red fluorescent protein mRFP . Spots corresponding to the centromere 270 ima1D lem2D . electron microscopy examinations . The nuclear mem-branes of all of the wild-type cells examined had nor-mal morphology Fig. 4A . In contrast , abnormality of the nuclear membranes in ima1D lem2D cells was observed even though the nucleus showed a round shape in fluorescence microscopy . Strikingly , in some of these cells , double membrane structures branched from the nuclear envelope were observed in the nuclear interior Fig. 4B . Single central sections of ima1D lem2D cells were examined for the intranuclear branched double membranes , and such a structure was observed in 20 of 155 ima1D lem2D cells 13 % . These structures were observed less frequently in three of 49 ima1D cells 6 % , but not in any of 87 wild-type cells or in 50 lem2D cells . Milder deforma-tion of the nuclear membranes was also observed in ima1D lem2D cells Fig. 4C . These results suggest that aberrant double membrane structures emanate from the INM into the nuclear interior in the absence of Ima1 and Lem2 . In some ima1D lem2D cells , enclosed compartments surrounded by a single membrane were also observed within the nucleus Fig. 4D . Although the identity and origin of these compartments is unknown , their morphology was somewhat similar to vacuoles . Such compartments were observed in 14 of 155 ima1D lem2D cells 9 % and in two of 49 ima1D cells 4 % . These structures were never observed in 87 wild-type cells and 50 lem2D cells . Taken together , the results indicate that double membranes emanating from the INM and single membranes inside the nucleus are characteristic of cells in which the ima1 gene is disrupted . Persistent connection of the anaphase nuclear envelope in ima1D lem2D cells To understand the growth defects of ima1D lem2D cells , mitotic progression was examined by time-lapse microscopy . Behaviors of the nuclear envelope and microtubules were followed in wild-type and ima1D lem2D cells at 30 °C Fig. 5 . In wild-type cells as anaphase proceeded , the nuclear envelope changed its shape from round to oval 3–5 min in Fig. 5A , and soon after it turned into a dumbbell shape with two round daughter nuclei connected by a thin piece of nuclear envelope 6 min in Fig. 5A , indicated by the arrow . Elongation of the anaphase spindle moved the two daughter nuclei further apart to reach the maximum distance 8 min in Fig. 5A . Immediately after spindle breakdown , the two daughter nuclei moved closer to each other 9 min in Fig. 5 , indi-cated by the arrowhead at the same time , the thin nuclear envelope connection was abscised 100 % of wild-type cells , n 14 . Many of the ima1D lem2D cells proceeded through mitosis at 30 °C as expected from their mild growth retardation phenotype Fig. 2A . Changes in the nuclear envelope shape were observed to have similar kinetics to that of wild-type cells 3–5 min in Fig. 5B , and spindle elongation in anaphase was not strongly affected 3– 9 min in Fig. 5B . However , the subsequent process of nuclear division was significantly delayed in ima1D lem2D cells Fig. 5B The time between the appear-ance of a dumbbell-shape nucleus indicated by the arrow in Fig. 5A , B and the daughter nuclei approaching each other indicated by the arrowhead in Fig. 5A , B is plotted for the mutants in Fig. 5C . This delay was accompanied by a spindle that had fully elongated but had not yet disassembled Fig. 5B . A milder but significant delay was also observed in ima1D cells but not in lem2D cells Fig. 5C . Interestingly , the nuclear envelope extend-ing between two daughter nuclei was observed even after the spindle breakdown in some of the ima1D lem2D cells , as shown in Fig. 5B 12.9 % , n 31 . Such persistent connection of the nuclear envelope of daughter nuclei was never observed in the wild-type cells Fig. 5A . These results suggest abnormal spindle dynamics or nuclear membrane properties in the absence of Ima1 and Lem2 . Discussion An S. pombe INM protein Ima1 has been recently identified as a homologue of the rat protein NET5 , and it has been proposed that it functions in linking centromeres to the SPB King et al. 2008 . Here , we report that lack of Ima1 does not break the linkage between centromeres and the SPB in interphase cells . Instead , our results suggest that Ima1 maintains nuclear membrane organization together with Lem2 and Man1 , LEM-domain containing INM proteins . These results are contradictory to the previous report , and we attribute this discrepancy to the mutant strains used in the previous report . Functions of INM proteins in shaping the nuclear envelope Many of the INM proteins , such as the SUN-domain protein family or the LEM-domain protein family , are widely conserved , whereas nuclear lamina proteins are only found in a limited range of animals . Thus , INM proteins are expected to have more universal functions than nuclear lamina proteins . Among the LEM domain containing INM proteins , emerin is well char-acterized as a causal protein of Emery-Dreifuss muscu-lar dystrophy , one of the laminopathy diseases Muchir Worman 2007 Brown et al. 2008 Wheeler Ellis 2008 emerin has been reported to have a role in signaling , nuclear assembly and regula-tion of gene expression through its interaction with various binding partners Haraguchi et al. 2001 Lee et al. 2001 Wilson et al. 2005 Muchir et al. 2007 Wagner Krohne 2007 Tifft et al. 2009 . Man1 has also been reported to have a role in signaling for dif-ferentiation Osada et al. 2003 Pan et al. 2005 Cohen et al. 2007 Ishimura et al. 2008 Pinto et al. 2008 Huber et al. 2009 Wagner et al. 2010 . However , Ima1 has not been well characterized , and aberrant nuclear membrane structures observed in our electron microscopy studies provide the first demonstration of the importance of INM proteins in maintaining proper organization of the nuclear envelope . Based on our observations , it is likely that S. pombe Ima1 , Lem2 and Man1 have redundant functions in the nuclear envelope at least in part . It has also been reported that in Caenorhabditis elegans , LEM-domain proteins have overlapping functions in chromosome segregation Liu et al. 2003 . In S. pombe , deletion of the ima1+ , lem2+ and man1+ genes in combination causes defects in mitotic cell growth to different degrees , and the levels of growth defects correlate with the abnormality of the nuclear membranes . However , it remains unclear what causes defects in mitotic cell growth in the mutants . Further electron microscopy studies showed that extension of the INM toward the nuclear interior is observed occasionally in cells lacking Ima1 and Lem2 , and less frequently in cells lacking Ima1 . Intimate connection between INM and ONM may be impor-tant for proper organization of the nuclear envelope , and loss of INM proteins may result in an imbalance between INM and ONM structures , leading to asymmetric extension of the nuclear membranes . Functions of Ima1 and Lem2 at the SPB Our yeast two-hybrid assay showed that these three proteins all interact with Sad1 . Yeast two-hybrid interaction between S. pombe Man1 and Sad1 has been reported previously Miki et al. 2004 . Interac-tions between Ima1 and a SUN-domain protein have also been suggested to occur in the nematode C. elegans Boxem et al. 2008 . The INM proteins Man1 , Lem2 and Ima1 may collaborate with Sad1 in the nuclear envelope at least in close proximity to the SPB . Double deletion of the ima1+ and lem2+ genes gave rise to more severe defects than any other combination of two genes , suggesting that all of the functions of Ima1 and Lem2 are not shared by Man1 . Differential localization of Ima1 and Lem2 at the SPB in the mitotic cell cycle may reflect their distinct functions at the SPB which are crucial for mitotic growth . Because many mitotic regulators such as Cdc2 , Cdc13 , Plo1 and Wee1 accumulate on the SPB at the beginning of mitosis in S. pombe Alfa et al. 1989 Mulvihill et al. 1999 Decottignies et al . 2001 Hagan 2008 Masuda et al. 2011 , it would be interesting to see whether Ima1 affects these cell cycle regulators . Inner nuclear membrane proteins can be important for organizing chromosomes within the nucleus . S. pombe has shown a striking example of an INM protein , Sad1 , playing an active role in moving telomeres along the nuclear envelope in meiotic prophase Telomeres are moved to the SPB by cytoplasmic microtubules , and the cytoplasmic driving forces are transmitted to telomeres through interaction of Sad1 with a meiosis-specific telomere protein Bqt1 Chikashige et al. 2006 reviewed in Chikashige et al. 2007 Hiraoka Dern-burg 2009 . However , centromeres are connected to the SPB in vegetative cells . Centromere-SPB connec-tions seem to involve multiple redundant interactions unlike the apparently simple telomere-SPB connection . The Nuf2 complex of the centromere is involved in the centromere’s connection to the SPB because loss of Nuf2 causes separation of centromeres from the SPB Nabetani et al. 2001 Asakawa et al. 2005 King et al . 2008 . However , centromere components that directly interact with INM proteins have not been found . Because Ima1 function turned out to be unrelated to centromere positioning , it re-opens the question of which INM proteins , if any , can affect positions of the centromere within the nucleus .

Introduction Aging coincides with a decline in muscle mass and strength , and in motor and functional performance , which contribute to rising morbid-ity Taekema et al. , 2010 Rantanem et al. , 1999 and mortality Ling et al. , 2010 Metter et al. , 2002 rates . Over the age of 50 , muscle mass decreases by 1–2 % annually Abellan Van Kan , 2009 , and muscle strength by 1.5 % up to 60 years old , and by 3 % per year thereafter . Pre-vious studies on the role of physical activity in preventing this decline in muscle mass and function in older people indicated that long-term , mildly to moderately intensive physical exercise and daily ambulatory activity are effective in maintaining and or improving muscle strength and aerobic capacity Latham et al. , 2003 Taguchi et al. , 2010 Keysor , 2003 . On the other hand , in Koster s Health Aging and Body Compo-sition ABC study , the rate of decline in muscle strength over a 7-year follow-up was similar in the least fit 400-m walk time ? 7 min and in the fittest individuals 400-m walk time ? 5 min Koster et al. , 2010 .

Circulating levels of inflammatory markers , such as interleukin-6 IL-6 , tumor ne-crosis factor-alpha TNF- ? , and C-reactive protein CRP are often ele-vated in older people Schaap et al. , 2009 and a growing body of evidence associates higher levels of these inflammatory markers with a worse physical performance and incident disability Cesari et al. , 2004 . The role of inflammatory markers in physical decline may be me-diated by a direct action on muscle mass and strength Ferrucci et al. , 2002 . Hyperparathyroidism secondary to vitamin D deficiency may also indirectly affect muscle function Lips , 2001 . In vitro , administer-ing PTH has been shown to raise protein catabolism and increase the number of type 2 muscle fibers , energy-rich intracellular phosphate compounds , and mitochondrial oxygen uptake Houston et al. , 2007 . PTH has also been shown to induce serum IL-6 production McCarty , 2005 . Although physical activity is known to protect against loss of mus-cle mass and function in the elderly , the influence of cytokines , PTH and 25-OHD on physical decline in healthy elderly subjects routinely taking moderate physical exercise has been under investigated . The aim of our study was to investigate changes in muscle mass , strength and physical performance in active , healthy elderly females over 3 years , correlating these changes with any inflammatory states and the women s PTH and 25-hydroxyvitamin D 25-OHD levels . 2 . Materials and methods 2.1 . Subjects This study was conducted at the Geriatrics Department of Padua University . Women over 65 years of age , recruited on a voluntary basis from among the old people attending a twice-weekly mild fitness program of aerobic and or resistance exercises at public gyms in Padova were eligible for the study . Their physical activity level was assessed according to the NASA scale and all participants were assigned to class B , corresponding to a regular , moderate physical activity Jackson et al. , 1990 . Their healthy condition was established by trained medical personnel from their clinical history , clinical examination and biochem-ical test results . During the follow-up , all participants continued their fitness program and their attendance was monitored and recorded monthly in registers kept at the gyms . Any individuals with significant cardiovascular or pulmonary dis-eases , uncontrolled metabolic disease diabetes , anemia or thyroid disease , electrolyte abnormalities , cancer or inflammatory condi-tions were ruled out . Any use of drugs corticosteroids , hormones , etc. that might interfere with body composition was also a reason for exclusion . The study was designed in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration and approved by the local Ethical Committee . All partici-pants were fully informed about the nature , purpose , procedures and risks of the study , and gave their informed consent . Among 135 eligible women , 105 met the inclusion exclusion criteria and entered the study . Over the 3-year follow-up , 5 dropped out , while 100 women aged 70.5±4.0 years at the baseline completed the study . All participants underwent the following tests at the baseline and again 3 years later . 2.2 . Blood tests Venous blood samples were collected after overnight fasting to mea-sure albumin , IL-6 , CRP , TNF- ? , 25-OHD and PTH . Albumin was assessed using the biuret assay , CPR by immunonephelometry . IL-6 and TNF- ? were measured in serum samples on the IMMULITE One Medical Sys-tem S.p.A. , Genova , Italy , a solid-phase , enzyme-labeled , chemilumi-nescent sequential immunometric assay . 25-OHD was determined by RIA Incestar Corp , Stillwater , MN , USA , PTH by IRMA Allegro TM In-tact , Nicholas Institute , S. Juan Capistrano , CA , USA . 2.3 . Anthropometric measurements Body weight was measured to the nearest 0.1 kg and height to the nearest 0.1 cm using standard scales and stadiometer Seca , Germany with subjects wearing light clothing and no shoes . Body mass index BMI was calculated as the weight in kilograms divided by the height in meters squared . 2.4 . Calcium intake The individuals calcium intake was derived from their dietary his-tory , investigated by a trained dietician using a national food compo-sition table Carnovale and Miuccio , 1989 . 2.5 . Body composition Fat-free mass FFM and fat mass FM were evaluated on whole body scans using a dual-energy X-ray DEXA fan beam densitome-ter Hologic QDR 4500 W , Inc and the related dedicated software rel . 8.2 . The principles behind body composition analysis using the fan beam DEXA have been explained elsewhere Kelly et al. , 1998 . The repeatability of the method was 2–3 % for FM , 1–2 % for FFM the coefficients of variation were assessed by repeated mea-surements of phantoms and normal subjects . The DEXA has a good reproducibility in determining soft tissue composition , and findings are consistent in elderly subjects too Baumgartner et al. , 1995 . Ap-pendicular skeletal muscle mass ASMM was also measured as the sum of the fat-free soft tissue masses of the limbs , as described by Heymsfield et al . Heymsfield et al. , 1990 . 2.6 . Muscle strength tests Handgrip strength and knee extensor isometric and isotonic strength were tested on the dominant side using the Dynatronic 100 ergometer Nuova Meccanica Pastorelli , Gallarate , VA , Italy and recorded in kg . For each 3 measurements , patients were asked to per-form their maximum voluntary contraction . Three to 5 s after reaching their maximum effort , they were asked to stop the contraction . Each measurement was repeated 3 times and patients rested for 2–3 min between trials . The mean peak torque emerging from three trials was calculated and used for the analysis . The coefficient of variation for double determinations in 20 subjects was 3.3 % for handgrip and 7.7 % for knee extension . 2.7 . Physical performance tests Lower body performance was assessed using the Short Physical Performance Battery SPPB Guralnik et al. , 1994 , derived from three objective physical function tests , i.e. 4-meter walking speed , re-peated chair stands , and standing balance in progressively more chal-lenging positions . Walking speed was defined as the better time of 2 walks over a 4-meter course at usual pace . For the chair stand test , participants were asked to rise 5 times from a seated position as quickly as possible with their hands folded across the chest , and per-formance was expressed as the total time taken to complete the test . For the standing balance tests , participants were asked to stand in 3 progressively more difficult positions for 10 s each with feet side by side , and in semi-tandem and full tandem positions . Each test was scored from 0 inability to complete the test to 4 highest level of performance . The scores from all three tests were summarized in a composite score of 0 to 12 , higher scores reflecting better physical function . 2.8 . Statistical analysis All statistical analyses were performed with the SAS rel . 9.1 SAS Institute , Inc. , Cary , N.C. , USA . For all subjects , the results were expressed as means±standard deviations of absolute values , and as the difference ? between the baseline and the follow-up findings 3 years . We also checked the changes in SPPB scores , handgrip , and isotonic and isokinetic leg strength after 3 years in two subgroups di-vided according to the 50th percentile of changes in PTH and 25-OHD . The significance of all changes was tested using Student s paired two-sided t-test . Pearson s linear correlations were used to examine the re-lationship between any changes after 3 years . The level of statistical significance for each test was set at 0.05 . 3 . Results The anthropometric and body composition parameters , the venous blood markers and calcium intake at the baseline and after 3 years are shown in Table 1 . The subjects baseline BMI was 26.3±3.4 kg m2 and their FFM was 40.3±4.5 kg . After 3 years , they had decreased signifi-cantly in weight ? ? 0.8±3.1 kg pb0.05 and height ? ? 0.4± 0.6 cm pb0.001 , while their BMI and body composition parameters did not change .

Three years later , only IL-6 increased significantly ? 0.6±2.0 pb0.01 , while there were no significant differences in TNF ? or CRP levels Table 1 .

Table 2 shows the partial and total SPPB scores and the time spent in the 4-meter walk and chair stand tests . The baseline mean total SPPB score was 10.5±1.5 and the 4-meter walking speed was 1.3± 0.3 m s . A significant decrease in all SPPB scores was apparent after 3 years . Fig. 1 shows the mean values of muscle strength tests at baseline and at follow up . A significant decrease in handgrip strength ? ? 3.6±5.8 kg pb0.001 and lower limb isotonic ? ? 1.5±3.6 kg pb0.01 , and isometric strength ? ? 2.0±4.7 kg pb0.05 was seen after 3 years .

Discussion Our study shows that muscle strength and physical performance decline in well-performing , healthy elderly females despite limited body composition changes . Our subjects had anthropometric and body composition characteristics similar to other elderly reference populations . They had a BMI ? 20 and mean BMI values 26.3±3.4 vs 27.6±5.7 comparable with the age-and sex-matched reference elderly population of the Italian Longitudinal Study on Aging ILSA , which identified a BMI of 20 as a threshold for the risk of underweight status in the elderly Sergi et al. , 2005 . Their mean FFM values , cor-rected for height FFMI , obtained by DEXA 16.4±1.5 , corresponded to the 50th percentile 16.0 of the FFMI distribution in a Caucasian el-derly population in the Mediterranean area Coin et al. , 2008 .

No significant changes emerged in FFM and FM in our sample after 3 years . Previous reports of body composition changes in the elderly are controversial . Goodpaster Goodpaster et al. , 2006 found a mean 2.6 % drop in the FFM of elderly Caucasian women after 3 years , while Zamboni found no changes in total FFM in older women after 2 years Zamboni et al. , 2003 . The latter s findings are similar to ours , because participants in the two studies , coming from the same geographical area , probably had similar genetic traits and lifestyles . On the other hand , our subjects ASMM , which is con-sidered a better indication of muscle mass , did not change during the follow-up , while Zamboni observed a 2 % decrease after 2 years . This difference may be due to the fact that participants in their study did not attend any fitness programs during the 2-year follow-up , whereas our subjects attended twice-weekly classes of mild aerobic and or resistance exercises . The positive effect of physical activity in preventing a reduction in muscle mass was also observed in the ABC study by Koster et al . Koster et al. , 2010 . Considering the inflammation parameters , previous studies found an increase in IL-6 , TNF- ? and CRP with age , associated with a higher morbidity Vasan et al. , 2003 Joppa et al. , 2006 and mortality Harris et al. , 1999 . At the baseline , most of our women had normal IL6 , CRP and TNF- ? levels , and the prevalence of those with higher levels remained much the same after 3 years . Our subjects low inflammato-ry status probably depended on our selection criteria , which only in-cluded healthy females with an adequate level of physical activity . Only IL-6 increased after 3 years , by about 20 % . Similar findings were reported in old people by Zhu Shuhan Zhu et al. , 2009 , who found that IL-6 rose by 18 % in 3 years . High IL-6 levels N4.18 ng L in the elderly predict loss of muscle strength and functional perfor-mance at 3 years Zhu et al. , 2009 . In our study , only 10 % of the women had a baseline IL-6N4.18 ng L and their decline in muscle strength and SPPB scores at follow-up were similar to cases with nor-mal IL-6 values data not shown . The routine fitness program attended by our subjects probably limited the negative influence of the increase in IL-6 on muscle mass and function . Given the lack of any correlation between changes in inflammation indices and change in SPPB scores and muscle strength , we therefore surmise that inflam-matory status played no major part in the decline in physical perfor-mance observed after 3 years , and that other factors may have been involved . The proportion of subjects with low basal serum 25-OHD levels was consistent with reports on the InCHIANTI study elderly population , where the prevalence was 87 % Houston et al. , 2007 . Diffuse vitamin D deficiency in the elderly has already been reported and is a conse-quence of inadequate intake , scarce exposure to sunlight and a decline in vitamin D synthesis in the skin Gennari , 2001 Lauretani et al. , 2006 Malavolta et al. , 2005 . Our women had a 55 % increase in PTH over 3 years with no change in 25-OHD vitamin levels . The relationship between PTH and 25-OHD is not normally curvilinear , and PTH levels vary substantially for 25-OHD levels ranging from 50 to 75 nmol L. The mechanisms thought to underlie the age-related increase in serum PTH levels irrespective of vitamin D levels include a lower renal clearance , low dietary calcium intake and intestinal absorption , physical inactivity , and gut resistance to the action of vitamin D Sai et al. , 2011 Arabi et al. , 2010 . Our women had stable glomerular filtration rates during the 3-year follow-up but a significant drop in calcium intake ? intake calcium 257 mg . The aging process may also have con-tributed to raising PTH levels because aging is a risk factor regardless of 25-OHD levels Sai et al. , 2011 . Significant changes in muscle strength and physical performance also occur with aging . A decrease in muscle mass and strength begins around the age of 50 , becoming more dramatic beyond 60 years old Von Haehling et al. , 2010 . Our sample s mean baseline upper and lower limb muscle strength was comparable with other reports Houston et al. , 2007 and , after 3 years , muscle strength had de-creased by 20 % in the upper limb and about 15 % in the lower limb . This decline of 5–7 % a year is consistent with previous findings . Koster Koster et al. , 2010 reported an annual 5 % decline in knee extensor and handgrip strength from 70 to 73 years old . Beenakker Beenakker et al. , 2010 found handgrip strength dropped from 27.1 to 12.8 kg for women between the ages of 25 and 95 years . Since FFM remained much the same during the follow-up , maintaining muscle mass in the elderly does not prevent the decline in muscle strength associated with aging . As suggested by Goodpaster Goodpaster et al. , 2006 , therefore , the prevalent decline in muscle strength supports the hy-pothesis of a decline in muscle quality due to important factors such as physical inactivity , protein intake , oxidative stress and hormone e.g . sex hormone deficiencies . Cross-sectional studies indicate that age-related muscle weaken-ing is associated with poor muscle function Brooks and Faulkner , 1994 Frontera et al. , 1991 . The SPPB has been used extensively in community-dwelling elderly adults to assess physical and functional health Guralnik et al. , 1994 . The mean total SPPB score for our sub-jects at baseline was similar to the reference values reported in the InChianti study Houston et al. , 2007 , but higher than those mea-sured in sedentary elderly woman by McMurdo et al. 2010 , indirect-ly confirming the healthy status and acceptable physical performance of our sample . Three years later , the mean total SPPB score dropped by about 0.5 0.17 points year as in the elderly walkers in the Women s Health and Aging Study WHAS Simonsick et al. , 2005 , whose decline amounted to 0.1–0.2 points year , as opposed to 0.6 points year among non-walkers . Our study points to a role for PTH in declining physical performance . There is evidence of high PTH levels being a risk factor for sarcopenia in older men and women Visser et al. , 2003 . A prospective study also identified a trend between higher PTH levels and loss of hip flexor and knee extensor strength Verreault et al. , 2002 . Our study showed an in-crease in serum PTH levels after 3 years , related to a longer walking test time this may be due to a direct effect of PTH on skeletal muscle be-cause administering PTH has been shown to impair the production , transfer and use of energy in the skeletal muscle of rats , and to influence skeletal muscle protein and amino acid metabolism in rats Garber , 1983 Baczynski et al. , 1985 . PTH is also known to increase free intra-cellular calcium concentrations in muscle tissue Visser et al. , 2003 , which may disrupt muscle structure or function . An indirect effect can also be hypothesized PTH is known to induce IL-6 and IL-6sR produc-tion in rat liver , and it increases the circulating levels of these cytokines in vivo Mitnick et al. , 2001 we also observed an increase in IL-6 after 3 years . On the other hand , the role of PTH in muscle strength and func-tion decline seems limited because only 17 % of the variation in walking speed is explained by PTH changes and no correlation emerged with other variations in SPBB scores and muscle strength . This study shows that , over a period of 3 years , a moderate physi-cal activity enables to muscle mass to be preserved in the elderly , pos-sibly thanks to different factors , such as mechanical stress and a limited increase in the inflammatory cytokines . Our sample s none-theless experienced a decline in muscle strength and function . It is feasible to suggest that higher levels of physical activity might pre-vent this functional loss . Further studies would be needed , however , to research more appropriate fitness programs , also taking the lower maximal aerobic performance of elderly females into account Sergi et al. , 2010 . In conclusion , physical performance declines with advancing age even in healthy , active females with good muscle mass reserves and an increase in PTH seems to have a role in this decline . Tailored fitness programs , targeted on the particular characteristics of elderly people , are needed to attempt to prevent their loss not only of muscle mass , but also of muscle strength and performance .

21885030	Myopia is the most common human eye disorder and constitutes a significant public health concern.1 Specifi-cally , high myopia is a leading cause of visual impairment and blindness worldwide because of its associated ocular comorbidities of retinal detachment , macular degenera-tion , premature cataract , and glaucoma.1,2 Childhood myopia is primarily due to growth in axial length of the eyeball most cases are either congenital usually high myopia or juvenile onset between 7 and 16 years of age . In general , the earlier the onset of myopia occurs , the greater the degree of progression.1,2 Twin studies and heritability measures suggest a strong genetic component in myopia.3,4 Myopia is mostly regarded as a multifactorial polygenic disorder.1 Genome-wide association studies of the common presumably polygenic multifactorial myopia in large cohorts have recently identified association with genomic loci at chromosomes 13q12,5 15q14,6 and 15q25,7 as well as with genetic variants in CTNND2 MIM 604275 at 5p15.8 There are more than 150 defined monogenic syndromes in which familial high myopia is one of the features.1,3 These syndromes are associated with a range of other phenotypic changes , and most are associated with severe congenital myopia.3 Some syndromes affect processes , such as retinal processing , that are likely to be important in the regulation of eye size or affect the properties of connective-tissue macromol-ecules such as collagen.3 Pedigrees of apparently mono-genic nonsyndromic hereditary myopia were previously described and were mostly found to be autosomal domi-nant rarely , they were found to be X linked or reces-sive.1,9 At least 17 susceptibility loci have been described for nonsyndromic monogenic myopia.1,9 However , no clear causative gene mutations have been identified so far in these loci . Large consanguineous Israeli Bedouin kindred presented with an apparently autosomal-recessive phenotype of non-syndromic severe myopia with variable expressivity of cataract and vitreo-retinal degeneration Figure 1 . Thir-teen affected and 32 unaffected individuals M1–M45 , Figure 1 of the kindred underwent complete ophthalmic examination , including slit-lamp biomicroscopy , indirect ophthalmoscopy , measurement of visual acuity and refrac-tive errors , and examination of eye movements and ocular alignment . The study was approved by the Soroka Medical Center institutional review board and the Israeli Helsinki Committee for genetic studies , and informed consent was obtained from all individuals studied . The affected individuals seven males and six females , ages 7 to 65 years were examined by a clinical geneticist and had no apparent dysmorphology . They all appeared normal at birth and presented with poor sight in child-hood . In addition to myopia , many affected individuals developed cataracts and peripheral vitreo-retinal degenera-tion , and some had subluxated lenses . The onset of myopia usually preceded that of the cataracts and the retinal degeneration . Most affected individuals had high myopia between 5 and 18 diopters Table 1 , but two had mild myopia . Preoperative refractive error was not avail-able in two patients and in one eye of other three patients . Table 1 shows the spherical equivalent of myopia , calcu-lated for each eye as a sphere plus half of the cylinder of the refractive error . Mean refractive error was 11.3 diopters . All patients had axial myopia , as evidenced by an increased axial length of the eye the length ranged between 25.1 and 30.5 mm Table 1 . Eleven patients developed cataracts that were significant enough to warrant surgery in one or both eyes , usually in the first or second decade of life . In three patients , subluxated lenses were detected and were associated with cataracts in two patients and lens colo-boma in one of them . In an additional five patients , lens instability due to weak or partially missing lens zonules was found during cataract surgery . This caused surgical complications , including rupture of the lens capsule and decentration of the inserted intraocular lens , which required reoperation . In four patients , lens instability made it impossible to insert the intraocular lens at all , which left them aphakic . Peripheral vitreo-retinal degener-ative changes were found in nine patients Table 1 , four of whom developed retinal tears mostly dialyses causing retinal detachment in one or both eyes . In three patients 23 % of affected individuals , in spite of multiple surgical procedures , intractable retinal detachments led to blind-ness in one eye . Assuming a founder effect , we studied 11 affected indi-viduals and seven healthy individuals by performing a genome-wide linkage analysis with 400 fluorescently end-labeled polymorphic markers ABI PRISM Linkage Mapping Set MD10 [ Applied Biosystems ] as previously described.10 PCR products were separated by electropho-resis on an ABI PRISM 377 DNA Sequencer Applied Biosystems and analyzed with Gene-Scan software detailed results in Document S1 . Fine-mapping was carried out using polymorphic markers as previously described.10 Haplotypes were manually constructed and analyzed . Noninformative regions were excluded by the use of additional adjacent microsatellite markers . Analysis of the results with SUPERLINK software11 yielded two loci with LOD scores above two a LOD score of 4.1764 at marker D3S3530 and a LOD score of 3.04 at marker D7S484 . Fine mapping at the chromosome 7 locus ruled out its association with the disease Document S2 . We per-formed fine mapping surrounding D3S3530 by using the following additional polymorphic markers to test DNA samples of the 45 available family members 13 affected and 32 unaffected D3S1580 , D3S3549 , D3S2398 , D3S_A , D3S1294 , D3S1314 , D3S1288 , D3S2747 , D3S3043 , D3S_B , D3S2455 , and D3S1601 D3S_A and D3S_B are polymor-phic markers designed with Tandem Repeats Finder primer sequences are given in Document S3 . As seen in Figure 2 , an interval of homozygosity common to all affected individuals in the family was demonstrated between markers D3S3530 and D3S2455 . Six affected individuals M2 , M14 , M15 , M17 , M18 , and M25 lacked homozygosity at D3S3530 , setting the upper limit of the homozygosity interval at D3S3530 Figure 2 . Ten affected individuals M2 , M8 , M14 , M11 , M12 , M15 , M17 , M18 , M29 , and M25 presented with a recombination event at D3S2455 , setting the lower limit of the homozygosity interval at D3S2455 . The common haplotype indicated a minimal candidate interval of 1.7 Mbp ~4 cM that con-tained six known or predicted genes . Linkage was demon-strated by two-point analysis with SUPERLINK , 11 which provided a LOD score of 11.5 at q ? 0 for Marker D3S1314 data available upon request . On the basis of data from the UCSC Genome Browser , only six genes were located within the identified interval . Their coding sequences and exon-intron boundaries were amplified from genomic DNA with PCR primers designed with the Primer3 program all primer sequences are given in Document S3 . PCR products were subject to agarose-gel electrophoresis and gel extraction QIAGEN , followed by sequencing with either the forward or reverse primer on an ABI PRISM 377 DNA Sequencer Applied Biosystems . Results were analyzed with ChromasPro software , and the obtained DNA sequences were compared with pub-lished sequences BLAST software . No mutations were found in the coding regions or intron-exon boundaries of five genes within the 3q28 locus . As shown in Figures 3A–3C , sequence analysis of LEPREL1 RefSeq number NM_018192.3 MIM 610341 revealed that exon 10 con-tained a c.1523G T mutation , which led to the replace-ment of glycine at position 508 by valine p.Gly508Val c.1523G T in the encoded protein , LEPREL1 Leprecan-Like 1 , termed also P3H2 . It should be noted that LEPREL1 was suggested by our S2G software12 to be the top candi-date gene of the six genes within the locus .

We analyzed PCR products by denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography DHPLC , WAVE Nucleic Acid Fragment Analysis System , Transgenomics . Analysis of all 45 DNA samples of the kindred was compatible with association of the mutation with the disease phenotype , implying full penetrance with variable expressivity . The mutation was not found in any of 400 chromosomes from ethnically matched controls tested by DHPLC . It should be noted that the glycine at position 508 of LEPREL1 is conserved throughout evolution Figure 3D . As seen in Figure 3E , the p.Gly508Val mutation is predicted to alter the three - dimensional structure of the prolyl-hydroxylase encoded by LEPREL1 NNpredict .13 To test for functional consequences of the LEPREL1 mutation , we analyzed wild-type and p.Gly508Val mutant recombinant human P3H2 polypeptides expressed in insect cells . The P3H2 p.Gly508Val mutation was intro-duced into the pVL1392-P3H2 plasmid14 with the Quick-ChangeXL site-directed mutagenesis kit Stratagene . The recombinant vector was cotransfected into Spodoptera frugiperda Sf9 insect cells with modified Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus DNA BaculoGold , PharMingen by calcium phosphate transfection , and the recombinant viruses were amplified.15 Monolayer cultures of Sf9 cells in TNM-FH medium Sigma supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum HyClone were infected with the recombinant viruses coding for wild-type or mutant P3H2 at a multiplicity of 5 and a cell density of 5 3 106 per 100 mm plate . The cells were harvested 72 hr after infection , washed with a solution of 0.15 M NaCl and 0.02 M phosphate pH 7.4 PBS , and homogenized in a solution of 0.1 M NaCl , 0.1 M glycine , 2 mM CaCl2 , 10 mM dithiothreitol , 0.1 % Triton X-100 , 0.01 M Tris pH 7.8 , and the complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail Roche Diagnostics , and centrifuged at 13,000 x g for 20 min . The remaining pellets were solubilized in 1 % SDS , and aliquots of both fractions were analyzed by 15 % SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions followed by Coomassie Blue staining or ECL-immunoblotting Amer-sham Biosciences with a polyclonal antibody against P3H214 at a 1 500 dilution . Equal amounts of soluble wild-type and mutant P3H2 polypeptides were found in the Triton X-100-soluble fractions not shown that were assayed for P3H activity by a method based on the hydroxylation-coupled decarboxylation of 2-oxo- [ 1-14C ] glutarate16 with differing amounts of a peptide substrate Gly-Pro-4Hyp 5 , Innovagen . In additional experiments , the peptide substrate was replaced by the synthetic peptides Ser-Lys-Gly-Glu-Gln-Gly-Phe-Met-Gly-Pro-4Hyp-Gly-Pro-Gln-Gly-Gln-4Hyp-Gly-Leu-4Hyp-Gly or Pro-Thr-Gly-Pro-Arg-Gly-Phe-Pro-Gly-Pro-4Hyp-Gly-Pro-Asp-Gly-Ley-4Hyp-Gly-Ser-Met-Gly , corresponding to two known prolyl 3-hydroxylation sites in the collagen IV a1 chain17 or by Leu-Asn-Gly-Leu-4Hyp-Gly-Pro-Ile-Gly-Pro-4Hyp-Gly-Pro-Arg-Gly-Arg-Thr-Gly-Asp-Ala-Gly , corresponding to the only prolyl 3-hydroxylation site in the collagen I a1 chain at position 986 of the triple helix.18 Triton X-100 extracts of insect cells expressing human collagen prolyl 4-hydroxylase isoenzyme II C-P4H-II 19 were used whereas the activity of the p.Gly508Val mutant P3H2 never exceeded the back-ground values Table 2 . Also , the mutant P3H2 polypeptide did not show any activity when synthetic peptides represent-ing the known prolyl 3-hydroxylation sites in human type I and type IV collagen poly-peptides were used as substrates data not shown . LEPREL1 is localized to the ER and the Golgi network.20 The 708 amino acid pro-tein contains a signal sequence , four tetra-tricopeptide repeats TPRs , a leucine zipper , a P loop , and a C-terminal region that contains the catalytically critical residues that are required for binding of Fe2 ? and 2-oxoglutarate and are shared with the collagen-modifying lysyl hydroxylases and prolyl 4-hydroxylases , as well as other 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases and a C-terminal KDEL ER-retention motif.19,20 The mutation results in a glycine-to-valine substitution at amino acid 508 within the C-terminal region.19 The mutated glycine is a highly conserved residue within the P3H family Figure 3D , suggesting its importance the p.Gly508Val variant is predicted via PolyPhen algorithms to be probably damaging with a position-specific independent counts PSIC score difference of 2.423 moreover , sub-stitution of glycine with valine leads to putative changes in the secondary structure of the protein Figure 3E .13 Accordingly , the p.Gly508Val mutation led to complete inactivation of recombinant P3H2 polypeptide expressed in insect cells , both when analyzed with a Gly-Pro - 4Hyp peptide substrate that fulfills the substrate require-5 ments of P3H and when analyzed with synthetic peptides representing known prolyl 3-hydroxylation sites in human type I and type IV collagen polypeptides . The large kindred presented here is distinctive in its recessive heredity of myopia . Interestingly , a study of juvenile cataract with myopia in a Chinese family demon-strated linkage to a locus between D3S3606 and D3S1262 , approximately 3 Mbp from the region highlighted in our kindred 21 however , the genomic loci in the two kindreds do not overlap . In contrast with that of the Bedouin kindred , the phenotype in the Chinese family was domi-nantly inherited , manifested as cataracts with likely P3H2 50 4570 5 320 P3H2Gly508Val 50 100 C-P4H-IIb 100 100 a The values are means 5 SD from at least three independent experiments . b The Triton X-100-soluble fraction of insect cells expressing C-P4H-II was used as a negative control . secondary myopia that appeared in only some of the affected individuals , and was found to be associated with a heterozygous mutation in BFSP2 MIM 603212 , a gene known to be mutated in dominant cataracts.21 The homozygous LEPREL1 mutation identified in affected individuals of the Bedouin kindred was associ-ated with full penetrance and variable expressivity of the disease . The main clinical phenotype was severe myopia . However , cataracts , vitreo-retinal degeneration , and subluxated lenses were also found in some patients . These led to severe ocular morbidity and a high rate of surgical complications , which resulted in blindness in 23 % of our patients . We clearly demonstrate that the myopia is due to increased axial eye length , although one can not rule out the possibility that changes in the lens might also contribute to the myopia phenotype . Although the cataract and vitreo-retinal degeneration might be related to the myopia , it is plausible that the myopia , cataracts , vitreo-retinal degeneration , and lens subluxation are all independent consequences of the LEPREL1 mutation . The association of the LEPREL1 mutation with ocular abnormalities is in line with previous findings LEPREL1 is found in a wide variety of tissues , including the eye 22 specifically , it was demonstrated in the iris , lens , trabecular meshwork , and retinal pericyte cells NEIBank . Recent protein-localization studies of the P3H isoenzymes in mouse demonstrated that P3H2 appears to be coordinately expressed with and therefore recognizes basement membrane collagens such as type IV collagen.23 Further-more , it was suggested that other basement-membrane-associated collagens may be targets of this enzyme as well.23 It is noteworthy that collagen type IV is found in various ocular structures , including the lens , iris , retina , retinal pigment epithelium , and trabecular meshwork NEIBank . Interestingly , P3H2 is expressed in the devel-oping lens capsule of mouse embryos E11–E15 .23 Because the lens capsule is a basement membrane whose main component is type IV collagen , these findings further suggest that defective collagen hydroxylation as a result of P3H2 inactivation might cause abnormality of the lens capsule , possibly leading to the development of cata-racts and possibly contributing to the myopia phenotype by affecting distensibility of the lens capsule . An abnor-mally weak lens capsule can also account for a capsular rupture during cataract surgery such a rupture occurred in many of our patients . Because type IV collagen has been demonstrated in the ciliary zonules of the eye suspensory ligament of the lens , 24 its abnormality may cause a defective zonular structure . Weakening of the zon-ules probably underlies lens instability , as evidenced by spontaneous lens subluxation in some of our patients , as well as pathological zonulolysis during cataract surgery in others . Another basement membrane in the eye is the inner limiting membrane ILM of the retina . It has been shown that ILM is important for proper retinal development and in the early regulation of eye size ILM disruption resulted in marked eye enlargement in chick embryos , implicating that defective ILM might lead to congenital high myopia.25 Inactivation of P3H2 as a result of the LEPREL1 mutation in our patients might cause a weakened retinal ILM and thus lead to excessive eye growth and development of myopia . Likewise , a defective retinal base-ment membrane harbors greater risk for retinal tears and dialyses , which can lead to retinal detachments such as those observed in some of our patients . This predisposi-tion , in addition to complicated cataract surgery , might have further aggravated the prognosis of retinal detach-ments in our patients . It is worth noting that defects in collagen hydroxylation have been previously demonstrated to cause phenotypes similar to those caused by collagen mutations autosomal-recessive variants of osteogenesis imperfecta , a disease known to be caused by dominant collagen mutations , can be caused by defects in collagen prolyl 3-hydroxyl-ation.18,26,27 Development of myopia has been shown to be associated with decreased rates of collagen synthesis in the sclera.28 Moreover , various clinical syndromes such as Stickler syndrome MIM 108300 , Marshall syn-drome MIM 154780 , and Weissenbacher-Zweymuller syndrome MIM 277610 , in which myopia is a prominent feature , are caused by defects in collagens.3,4 Thus , whereas mutations in collagen genes cause autosomal-dominant myopia syndromes , defects in collagen hydroxylation might cause autosomal-recessive myopia . It of course yet remains to be tested whether P3H2 modifies the collagens known to act in those processes . Our findings demonstrate a significant role of LEPREL1 in the molecular pathways of ocular growth , as well as in the development of myopia and cataracts . Further studies will need to explore whether LEPREL1 mutations or polymorphisms are associated with ocular abnormalities in a wider population . An improved understanding of the molecular basis of pathological myopia might allow early diagnosis and treatment and thus prevent irreversible visual loss , as developed in our patients .

21895890	elegans Introduction Organisms are subject to a variety of environmentally imposed stresses , including UV radiation , heat , and free radicals . Consequently , they possess a variety of defense mechanisms to protect against these stresses . Isolation and characterization of mutants with altered sensitivities to such environmental stresses has greatly contributed to our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of these defense systems . Of the various environmental stresses , much attention has focused on reactive oxygen species ROS , oxygen-containing free radicals . Oxygen is indispensable for aerobic organisms but harms cells through the generation of ROS that have the potential to damage cellular com-ponents such as proteins , DNA , and lipids . Oxidative stress is inevitable for aerobic organisms , and thus they have developed various defense mechanisms Communicated by Yuichi Iino the onset of neurodegenerative diseases , such as hereditary spastic paraplegia , Parkinson’s disease , Alz-heimer’s disease , Huntington’s disease , and amyo-trophic lateral sclerosis Lin Beal 2006 DiMauro Schon 2008 . Thus , mitochondrial function seems to be an important factor that links energy metabolism , ROS , and diseases . We have characterized the rad-8 mutant in C. ele-gans , which was originally isolated as a mutant with an increased sensitivity to UV but not to X radia-tion Hartman Herman 1982 . Interestingly , rad-8 also shows hypersensitivity to ROS and decreased longevity under hyperoxic conditions Ishii et al. 1993 . Under normoxic conditions , however , rad-8 possesses an almost normal life span at 20 ? C and surprisingly , an extended life span at 16 ? C Ishii et al. 1994 . Detailed characterization of rad-8 at the molecular level would provide valuable information on the mechanisms that regulate stress sensitivity and aging . In this study , we show that a mutation in rad-8 resulted in a decreased activity of the respiratory chain , increased generation of superoxide anions O2 in mitochondria , increased oxidization of pro-teins , increased apoptosis , and abnormal structure of mitochondria . These results suggest that mitochon-drial function would be impaired in rad-8 , and in agreement with this , our analysis indicated that rad-8 has a causative mutation in a dehydrogenase ? reductase gene that functions in mitochondria . These results suggest an important role of RAD-8 in oxygen metabolism in mitochondria . Results Oxidative damage in rad-8 observation that rad-8 is hypersensitive to oxidative stress Ishii et al. 1993 . To explore the molecular mechanisms for the increased sensitivity to oxidative stress in rad-8 , we examined O2 generation in mitochondria . For this , we incubated mitochondria isolated from the wild-type N2 and rad-8 with a chemiluminescent probe that is sensitive to ROS . We found that rad-8 mito-chondria generated significantly higher levels of O2 than did N2 mitochondria Fig. 1A , P 0.05 . We then examined oxidative damage in N2 and rad-8 by measuring the levels of oxidized proteins . The Wes-tern blot analysis showed that rad-8 showed an increase in carbonylated proteins , which result sug-gests that rad-8 suffered from higher levels of oxida-tive stress than did N2 Fig. 1B , P 0.05 . These results are in good agreement with our previous Two different maternal-effect tests were conducted . First , rad-8 unc-40 hermaphrodites were crossed with wild-type males and the oxygen sensitivities of the cross-progeny were examined . The question was whether the cytoplasm from the embryo which is homozygous for rad-8 and hence oxygen hypersensi-tive would affect the development of a heterozygous + ? rad-8 unc-40 larva , which should have normal oxygen sensitivity because rad-8 is known to be reces-sive Hartman Herman 1982 . The cross-progeny proved to be as oxygen resistant as wild type , even under early and continuous exposure to 90 % oxygen for the 4 days necessary to complete development data not shown . Thus , the rad-8 ooplasm did not confer hypersensitivity to oxygen , indicating the absence of a maternal effect . Second , heterozygous ++ ? rad-8 unc-40 hermaphrodites were allowed to lay eggs at different oxygen concentrations . The oxy-gen sensitivity of these offspring was then determined . This was to test the possibility that wild-type cyto-plasm that is , derived from ++ ? rad-8 unc-40 oocytes might confer some oxygen resistance to the rad-8 offspring . Again , the presence of the tightly linked unc-40 mutation allowed the uncoordinated pheno-type to serve as a proxy for rad-8 homozygosity . The percentage of Unc-40 offspring decreased from 3.4 % under 5 % oxygen to 1 % under 70 % oxygen . Thus , the presence of wild-type RAD-8 in oocytes did not significantly rescue the oxygen sensitivity of the offspring . Activities of the respiratory chain complexes We examined the activity of the respiratory chain in mitochondria in N2 and rad-8 , because it is critically involved in the generation of O2 . We determined the activities of NADH-cytochrome c oxidoreductase complex I–III and succinate-cytochrome c oxidore-ductase complex II–III by measuring the flow of an electron from NADH to cytochrome c and from suc-cinate to cytochrome c , respectively . Electrons are transferred by ubiquinone both from complex I to complex III and from complex II to complex III . We also determined the activity of cytochrome c oxidase complex IV by measuring the oxidation of cyto-chrome c . As shown in Fig. 2A , a substantial decrease in the succinate-cytochrome c oxidoreductase activity complex II–III was observed in rad-8 P 0.05 , whereas no significant differences were observed in the other activities . These results suggest that rad-8 possesses normal activities of the respiratory chain complex I , III , and IV as well as a normal electron transfer activity from complex I to complex III but that rad-8 possibly possesses decreased activity of the complex II and ? or of the electron transfer from com-plex II to complex III . We then examined the activity of succinate-ubiquinone oxidoreductase , which repre-sents the complex II activity , but did not find signifi-cant differences in it Fig . 2B . We further examined the expression level of Cyt-1 , succinate dehydrogenase cytochrome b MEV-1 , in complex II . The expres-sion level of Cyt-1 was not significantly changed in rad-8 Fig. 2C . In addition , the expression of two other mitochondrial proteins [ voltage-dependent anion channel VDAC and the ß-subunit of the com-plex V ] was the same in wild type and rad-8 Fig. 2C . These findings suggest that rad-8 possesses normal activities of the complex II and complex III , but is compromised in succinate-cytochrome c oxidoreduc-tase complex II–III . Thus , rad-8 may show impaired electron transfer from complex II to complex III . Electron microscopy of mitochondria As the above result implicated rad-8 in mitochondrial function , we examined the ultrastructure of mito-chondria in body wall muscles of rad-8 under various oxygen concentrations . As we have previously docu - mented Senoo-Matsuda et al. 2003 Yasuda et al . 2006 , the mitochondria of the wild-type strain N2 have normal mitochondrial morphologies , with extensive cristae , even when raised under 1 % or 40 % oxygen . A typical image of an electron micrograph of N2 is shown in Fig. 3A . In contrast , the rad-8 mutant showed abnormal , enlarged mitochondria with less-developed cristae even under hypoxic conditions 1 % oxygen Fig. 3B . Furthermore , some unidentified membranous structures were observed in considerable numbers of mitochondria of rad-8 Fig. 3B . Thus , a mutation in rad-8 led to a loss of structural integrity of mitochondria . These abnormalities are similar to those observed previously in the ROS-hypersensitive strain mev-1 , which is defective in complex II activity Senoo-Matsuda et al. 2003 . We investigated apoptosis in rad-8 because mitochon-dria are crucially involved in the execution of apop-tosis . We counted apoptotic cells in the embryos at the comma stage in N2 and rad-8 , and found that 40 stp124 hp5 bli-4 yielded the following result unc - The rad-8 gene is predicted to encode a protein of 366 amino acid residues with an N-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequence . Homology search of rad-8 F56H1.6 suggested that it showed similarity to proteins of the medium chain dehydrogenases ? reductases MDR superfamily represented by alcohol dehydrogenases Riveros-Rosas et al. 2003 Persson et al. 2008 . The MDR superfamily is proposed to be composed of many subfamilies , of which , RAD-8 showed the highest similarity to the members of the RT4I subfamily Persson et al. 2008 . RAD-8 shares 36.9 % identity and 61.2 % similarity with human RTN4IP ? NIMP Reticulon4 interacting protein ? Nogo interacting mitochondrial protein Hu et al. 2002 Persson et al. 2008 Fig. 6A . To gain a struc-tural insight into RAD-8 , its sequence is aligned with those of Escherichia coli quinone oxidoreductase QOR , Thermoplasma acidophilum glucose dehydroge-nase GDH , and horse alcohol dehydrogenase ADH , whose structure is well identified Edwards et al. 1996 Fig. 6B . QOR encodes a reductase , and the other two encode dehydrogenases . Although these proteins do not share high sequence similarity , they show very similar overall 3D structure Edwards et al. 1996 . As shown in Fig. 6B , the predicted secondary structure ¶-helixes and ß-sheets of RAD-8 roughly matches that of QOR Edwards et al. 1996 . The MDR proteins typically consist of two domains the NAD P -binding domain known as the ‘Rossmann fold’ Rao Rossmann 1973 and the substrate-binding domain presumably derived from the GroES chaperon proteins Jornvall et al. 2010 . The black tri-angles indicate the predicted amino acid residues involved in NAD P binding in RAD-8 , which include the GXGXXG motif Fig. 6B . Furthermore , the MDR proteins are classified into two groups based on the requirement for metal ions Zn2+ , and the MDR proteins with or without a zinc ion s generally encode dehydrogenases or reductases , respectively Hedlund et al. 2010 . Illustration of the amino acid residues that bind Zn2+ white triangles shows the presence of a ‘Zn loop’ in ADH and GDH 30–40 amino acid residues that follow the 95th amino acid residues of ADH and GDH Edwards et al. 1996 however , the Zn loop appears to be lacking in RAD-8 and QOR . This finding implies that RAD-8 may encode a reductase . Expression of RAD-8 To examine the expression pattern of RAD-8 in C. elegans , we expressed the RAD-8 GFP green fluorescent protein fusion protein from its own pro-moter in the wild-type strain N2 . This translational fusion protein appeared to be functional because it rescued the increased sensitivity to oxygen in rad-8 data not shown . Confocal laser microscopy showed GFP fluorescence in various tissues that include the neurons , pharynx , muscles , and intestine Fig. 7A . Thus , RAD-8 is likely ubiquitously expressed in C. elegans . As RAD-8 is predicted to be a mitochon-drial protein , we examined the subcellular localization of RAD-8 with the use of MitoTracker Red , which specifically stains mitochondria . The fluorescence sig-nal of RAD-8 GFP coincided well with that of Mi-toTracker Red in the tail cells . We thus concluded that RAD-8 was localized in mitochondria Fig. 7B . We next examined whether expression of rad-8 from a tissue-specific promoter was able to rescue the increased sensitivity to oxygen in rad-8 . For this , we first confirmed that ubiquitous expression of the rad-8 cDNA from the dpy-30 promoter effi-ciently rescued the increased sensitivity to oxygen in rad-8 . We then expressed rad-8 from the pan-neuronal H20 promoter Shioi et al. 2001 or from the pharynx-specific myo-2 promoter Okkema et al. 1993 in rad-8 , and found that the expression of rad-8 in neurons efficiently rescued the increased sensitivity to oxygen , whereas that in the pharynx did only weakly Table 1 . This result suggested that the functional role of rad-8 in neuronal cells was important for determining the sensitivity to oxygen in C. elegans . We further examined the functional conservation of rad-8 between C. elegans and humans by expressing a putative human homo-logue in rad-8 . Expression of human RTN4IP ? -NIMP from the dpy-30 promoter in rad-8 rescued the increased sensitivity to oxygen in rad-8 Table 1 , which result suggests that the functional role of rad-8 ? RTN4IP ? NIMP may be evolutionarily conserved . Table 1 Rescue of an increased sensitivity to oxygen in rad-8 Genes Species Promoters Expression Rescue RTN4IP ? Human dpy-30 Ubiquitous + Discussion Identification of responsible genes that , when mutated , result in altered sensitivities to environmen-tal stresses has led to a detailed understanding of the defense mechanisms against environmental stresses . In this study , we have analyzed the rad-8 mutant of C. elegans , which shows increased sensitivities to UV radiation and ROS , and have determined that the rad-8 mn163 mutation resides in the F56H1.6 gene . The gene is predicted to encode a dehydro-genase ? reductase that is a member of the MDR superfamily Riveros-Rosas et al. 2003 Persson et al . 2008 , of which , RAD-8 shows the highest similarity to the RTN4IP ? NIMP proteins . As exogenous expression of human RTN4IP ? NIMP rescued the increased sensitivity to oxygen in rad-8 , the rad-8 gene appeared to be the functional homologue of RTN4IP ? NIMP , which was isolated as a protein that interacts with RTN4 ? Nogo Hu et al. 2002 . RTN4 ? Nogo is a multifunctional protein involved in the maintenance of structural integrity of endoplasmic reticulum and inhibition of neurite growth in the central nervous system Oertle Schwab 2003 . Human RTN4IP ? NIMP functions in mitochondria Hu et al. 2002 , and we have shown here that RAD-8 was localized in mitochondria as well . Mitochondria are organelles that synthesize ATP by oxidative phos-phorylation in aerobic organisms , and are thought to be a major source of ROS . Then , mitochondrial pro-teins involved in oxygen metabolism would likely play important roles in the regulation of ROS . This view is supported by the finding that several mutations in the respiratory chain components lead to an increased sensitivity to ROS in C. elegans Ishii et al. 1990 Hartman et al. 2001 . This is certainly the case with the C. elegans mitochondrial proteins GAS-1 Hart-man et al. 2001 and MEV-1 Ishii et al. 1998 . Thus , it is logical that mutational inactivation of the mito-chondrial protein RAD-8 results in hypersensitivity to oxidative stress . In addition , rad-8 is also slightly hypersensitive to UV radiation Hartman Herman 1982 . This may be a consequence of the fact that UV irradiation induces ROS in cells Scharffetter-Kochanek et al. 1997 Chan Yu 2000 . Thus , the increased sensitivities to UV radiation and ROS in rad-8 may be caused by the same mechanism . What is the function of RAD-8 in mitochondria ? A mutation in rad-8 led to mitochondria dysfunction , for example , a decreased activity of the respiratory chain , increased generation of O2 , increased oxidative dam-age , increased apoptosis , and abnormal structure of mitochondria . These phenotypes are similar to those of mev-1 , a mutant with an increased sensitivity to ROS owing to a defect in the respiratory chain Ishii et al. 1990 , 1998 Senoo-Matsuda et al. 2001 , 2003 . We have shown that the molecular defect in RAD-8 also results in decreased activity of the respiratory chain Fig. 2A . Thus , as is the case with mev-1 , this can lead to an increased sensitivity to ROS in rad-8 . At present , the molecular mechanism by which RAD-8 affects the respiratory chain is not understood . Our results indicate that rad-8 showed the normal function of the respiratory chain complexes I , II , III , and IV , but showed a decreased succinate-cytochrome c oxidoreductase activity complex II–III . This find-ing suggests the decreased electron transfer by ubiqui-none from complex II to complex III in rad-8 . Although ubiquinone mediates the electron transfer both from complex I to complex III and from com-plex II to complex III , only the latter II to III was impaired in rad-8 . Interestingly , a similar phenomenon is observed in the clk-1 mutant in C. elegans , which lacks ubiquinone because of a defect in the synthesis of ubiquinone . In clk-1 , the activity of the electron transfer from complex I to complex III is specifically affected , whereas not that from complex II to complex III Kayser et al. 2004 . Thus , it is possible that the ubiquinone pool required for the electron transfer from complex I to complex III may be differentially regulated relative to that from complex II to complex III . This may be due to the fact that complexes I and III form supercomplexes , but not complexes II and III Schagger Pfeiffer 2000 . Consequently , rad-8 may be implicated in the regulation of the func-tion of ubiquinone required for the electron transfer from complex II to complex III . In this respect , it might be interesting to note that of the MDR super-family , the RT4I subfamily that includes rad-8 shows relatively high sequence similarity to a quinone oxido-reductase-like protein subfamily Persson et al. 2008 . Alternatively , human RTN4 ? Nogo , which interacts with RTN4IP ? NIMP , also interacts with the protein of the respiratory chain complex III Hu et al. 2002 . This finding suggests the possibility that these proteins may modulate the activity of the respiratory chain through the formation of protein complexes . Additionally , it should also be noted that RAD-8 may have function other than as a dehydro-genase ? reductase , as recently shown in another type of mitochondrial dehydrogenase , 17-ß-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 10 HSD10 , which is a responsi-ble gene for a human neurological disorder Ofman et al. 2003 . HSD10 is also implicated in Alzheimer’s disease because it binds to the amyloid-ß-peptide Yan et al. 1997 . A defect in HSD10 leads to a loss of mitochondrial integrity with increased apoptosis and abnormal mitochondrial structure , but interest-ingly , its enzymatic activity is not responsible for maintenance of mitochondrial integrity Rauschen-berger et al. 2010 . Then , identification of the pro-teins that interact with RAD-8 as well as identification of the substrate of RAD-8 should pro-vide clues to understand the function of RAD-8 . Moreover , understanding of the molecular function of RAD-8 might show a novel role of a dehydroge-nase ? reductase in mitochondrial function . Mitochondrial dysfunction causes various diseases , most of which affect brain and muscles . This is prob-ably due to the fact that these tissues have high energy demands . Recent findings have suggested that mitochondrial dysfunction can contribute to neuro-degenerative diseases such as hereditary spastic paraplegia , Parkinson’s disease , Alzheimer’s disease , Huntington’s disease , and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis Lin Beal 2006 DiMauro Schon 2008 . Thus , the relationship between mitochondrial dysfunction and neurodegenerative diseases is a matter of consi-derable importance . Interestingly , our results indicate that dysfunction in rad-8 in neuronal cells was largely responsible for the increased sensitivity to oxygen in rad-8 and thus suggest the possibility that neuronal damage or neuronal dysfunction led to an increased sensitivity in C. elegans . The same phenomenon is also observed in oxy-5 , which , like rad-8 , shows increased sensitivities to UV radiation and ROS Fujii et al. 2011 . Furthermore , in agreement with these findings , we have previously shown that neuronal cells may be a target of oxidative stress by paraquat in C. elegans Fujii et al. 2004 , 2005 . Given this , it would be interesting to examine the implication of RNT4IP ? NIMP in a human neurological disease . In summary , we have shown here that a mutation in the mitochondrial dehydrogenase ? reductase gene , rad-8 , caused hypersensitivity to ROS with defects in mitochondrial function . Elucidation of the functional role of rad-8 would provide a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms that regulate mitochondrial integrity , oxidative stress , aging and diseases .

21896840	PURPOSE . The authors investigated whether trigeminal sensiti-zation occurs in response to bright light with the retina dis-connected from the rest of the central nervous system by optic nerve section . METHODS . In urethane-anesthetized rats , trigeminal reflex blinks were evoked with air puff stimuli directed at the cornea in darkness and at three different light intensities . After nor-mative data were collected , the optic nerve was lesioned and the rats were retested . In an alert rat , reflex blinks were evoked by stimulation of the supraorbital branch of the trigeminal nerve in the dark and in the light . RESULTS . A 9.1 103 W cm2 and a 15.1 103 W cm2 light significantly enhanced the magnitude of reflex blinks relative to blinks evoked by the same trigeminal stimulus when the rats were in the dark . In addition , rats exhibited a significant in-crease in spontaneous blinking in the light relative to the blink rate in darkness . After lesioning of the optic nerve , the 15.1 103 W cm2 light still significantly increased the magnitude of trigeminal reflex blinks . CONCLUSIONS . Bright lights increase trigeminal reflex blink am-plitude and the rate of spontaneous blinking in rodents . Light can modify trigeminal activity without involving the central visual system . Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci . 2011 52 7852–7858 DOI 10.1167 iovs.11-7604 L ight can initiate a continuum of negative sensations in the orbit . People can experience disability glare in which light orbit . People can experience disability glare in which light scattering reduces visual contrast and produces a sensation of asthenopia eyestrain .1–3 An example of this is the effect of facing oncoming headlights when driving at night . Humans typically compensate for glare by squinting and increasing the rate of spontaneous blinking.2,4 Bright lights can also produce ocular discomfort that varies from mild to intolerable pain.5 Persons with diseases involving the anterior portion of the eye e.g. , uveitis or conjunctivitis that sensitize trigeminal nocice-ptors report increased sensitivity to light stimuli.6–9 Central trigeminal sensitization such as occurs with migraine and blepharospasm also reduce tolerance to bright light.10–17 Con-versely , bright light can exacerbate the effect of trigeminal stimuli.18 Although these data reveal a clear link between light and the trigeminal system in ocular discomfort , the pathophys - iology of ocular discomfort is uncertain and probably involves several processes . One group of explanations of the neural bases of photopho-bia focuses on central visual structures . Noseda et al.19 show that afferents from melanopsin-containing retinal ganglion cells innervating the posterior thalamus could be responsible for the ability of light to exacerbate migraine discomfort . Other investigators13,20 propose that photophobia also results from modifications in the visual cortex . Another group of investigator21,22 identify a role for the sympathetic system in photophobia . Okamoto et al.22 provide evidence that the activation of spinal trigeminal nociceptive neurons by visual stimuli results from trigeminal nociceptors responding to cho-roidal blood vessel dilation . Their study indicated that pretectal olivary neurons that are known to receive input from melanop-sin-containing retinal ganglion cells regulate the sympathetic nervous system’s control of choroidal blood flow.22 Although these explanations can explain the majority of photophobia characteristics , they have difficulty accounting for photopho-bia experienced by persons without light perception . Two studies describe patients without light perception who experience pronounced photophobia.23,24 One possible expla-nation is that these patients maintained visual input to mid-brain regions but were unconscious of this visual sensitivity.19 Some of the patients , however , did not exhibit a pupillary light reflex23 that would be expected to be present if the midbrain inputs were intact . Another possibility , however , is that in-traretinal processes independent of central visual centers can produce an enhanced trigeminal response to light . To deter-mine whether an intraretinal mechanism acts in concert with other processes to produce photophobia , we characterized the effects of bright light on reflex and spontaneous blinking be-fore and after lesioning the optic nerve in rats .

RESULTS Effect of Light in Normal Rats In urethane-anesthetized rats , the same air puff stimulus evoked a larger blink in the light than in the dark Fig. 1A . OOemg activity increased in a light intensity–dependent man-ner . ANOVA F 21.9 P 0.001 demonstrated that OOemg amplitude 3,341 increased significantly at the 9.1 103 W cm2 P 0.05 and 15.1 103 W cm2 P 0.001 light intensities relative to OOemg amplitude in the dark before the first light presentation Fig. 2A . OOemg duration , however , increased significantly only at the highest light intensity F 6.2 P 0.005 Fig. 2E . ANOVA F 15.75 , 3,341 P 0.001 demonstrated a significant increase 3,341 in OO-emg amplitude per millisecond at all light intensities relative to OOemg amplitude per millisecond in the dark before the first light presentation Fig. 2C . Thus , bright lights exaggerated the response to trigeminal stimuli in anesthetized rats , as occurs in humans experiencing photophobia.33 Blink amplitude facilitation was not uniform across all three of the 15.1 103 W cm2 light presentations in a cycle of data collection Fig. 3A . Although there was a trend for the first light presentation to produce the largest reflex blink potenti-ation when averaged across all rats , this effect was not signif - 3 A Amplitude 2 OOemg 1 Relative 0 ms 3 C ** 3 E Relative 0 icant F 0.67 P 0.05 . In individual rats , however , 2 of 69 the 4 rats with a complete lesion exhibited a significantly larger blink potentiation with the first light presentation than with the second or third presentation F 15.04 , P 0.001 F 7.9 , P 0.01 . Because the air puff stimulus occurred at 15 fixed intervals , it was not possible to determine how long the light had to be on for blink potentiation to develop . Nev-ertheless , potentiation had to develop in 37 seconds when the first air puff stimulus was delivered after light onset Fig. 3B . The presence of the brightest light , 15.1 103 W cm2 , significantly decreased the latency of air puff–evoked blinks relative to blinks evoked in the dark Figs . 1A , 4 . Among individual animals , the average blink latency in the dark ranged from 55.1 ms to 85.3 ms . To enable comparisons between animals , blink latency was normalized to the average blink latency in the first period of darkness for each animal . In all animals , the brightest light significantly decreased blink latency by 10 % relative to blinks evoked in the dark Fig. 4A t 3.71 P 0.001 . The amount of latency shortening , how-ever , depended on blink amplitude Fig. 4B . Plotting the blink latency relative to the average blink latency during the first period of darkness for each animal as a function of the blink amplitude relative to average blink amplitude during the first period of darkness demonstrated that blink latency decreased with increasing blink amplitude . Consistent with the enhance-ment of blink amplitude by the light , most of the light-evoked 9.1 X 103 15.1 X 103 9.1 X 103 15.1 X 103 Dark Light 9.1 X 103 15.1 X 103 5 A 4 3 2 Amplitude 1 0 Blink 0 200 400 5 B Relative 4 3 2 1 blinks had relative latency values 1 , indicating shortened blink latencies Fig. 4B , whereas most blinks elicited in the dark had values 1 Fig. 4B . Thus , the reduced latency asso-ciated with the brightest light appeared to result from light’s potentiation of blink amplitude . In the light , but rarely in the dark , 4 of the 5 anesthetized rats exhibited spontaneous blinks Figs . 1B , 5A . The shortest latency from light onset for these blinks , 7.2 seconds , was at least 70-fold longer than the shortest latency of blinks evoked by the onset of bright light 40–100 ms .34–37 In addition , the blinks occurred periodically rather than being linked to light onset . These data indicate that these were spontaneous blinks rather than light-evoked reflex blinks . As with the potentiation of blink amplitude by the 15.1 103 W cm2 light , there was a trend for spontaneous blinks to be more frequent in the first light presentation F 3.84 P 0.06 . Thus , light potenti-ated trigeminal reflex 9 blinks Figs . 1–3 and initiated spontane-ous blinks Figs . 1B , 5A in anesthetized rats . Intense light produced similar changes in the blinking of the alert rat , as occurred with anesthetized rats Fig. 6 . In the presence of the 15.1 103 W cm2 light , there was an insignificant increase in the R1 component of the SO-evoked blink reflex t 0.83 , P 0.05 Figs . 6A , 6B but a significant increase 54 in the amplitude of the R2 component t 4.45 , P 0.001 Figs . 6A , 6B relative to the blinks evoked 54 in the dark before the first light presentation . The light also increased the rate of spontaneous blinking Fig. 6C . In the dark , the average blink rate was 2.2 0.23 , whereas in the light , the average blink rate significantly increased to 6.6 0.46 t 8.04 P 0.001 . Thus , as with humans expe-riencing 98 photophobia , a bright light enhanced trigeminal reflex blink amplitude and increased the rate of spontaneous blinking in urethane-anesthetized and alert rats . Given that the trigem-inal reflex circuits involved in producing corneal and supraor-bital reflex blinks are different , 28–30 light produced a general rather than a localized increase in trigeminal excitability . Effect of Light in Rats with Optic Nerve Lesions The 15.1 103 W cm2 light intensity , but not the interme-diate intensity , continued to modify trigeminal reflex blinks after the optic nerve was cut Figs . 2 , 3 . Five rats were tested before and after lesioning . Complete sectioning of the optic nerve was verified in 4 of the 5 rats . These four rats were the source of the data reported after lesioning for before and after comparisons . The surgery to lesion the optic nerve reduced blink amplitude an average of 37 % relative to blink amplitude before surgery . After the optic nerve lesion , however , the brightest light still significantly increased OOemg amplitude P 0.001 Figs . 2B , 3A , OOemg amplitude ms P 0.001 Fig. 2D , and OOemg duration P 0.001 Fig. 2F . The relative increase in OOemg amplitude and duration produced by this light intensity was not significantly different before and after optic nerve lesioning OOemg amplitude , t 1.24 , P 0.05 OOemg duration , t 160 1.6 , P 0.05 .

Averaging relative OOemg amplitude 160 for each blink across all 15.1 103 W cm2 light presentations showed a trend toward a slower development of blink potentiation after the lesion , but the differences did not reach statistical significance because of the small number of animals Fig. 3B . Two of the four rats that exhibited spontaneous blinks in the light continued to generate spontaneous blinks after the optic nerve lesion . The rate of spontaneous blinking in these two rats , however , was only approximately 10 % of their rate of blinking before lesioning Fig. 5B . DISCUSSION In the presence of bright light , anesthetized and alert rats exhibit blink modifications like those of people experiencing ocular discomfort and photophobia . Bright light significantly increases the sensitivity of people to trigeminal stimuli , 14,15,18 and rats respond more strongly to trigeminal stimuli presented in bright light than in darkness Figs . 1–4 , 6 . Bright light significantly increases squinting and the spontaneous blink rate in people , 2,33,38,39 and rats generate more spontaneous blinks in the presence of bright lights than in darkness Figs. 1 , 5 , 6 . Although these parallel behaviors indicate neural mechanisms for photophobia shared by humans and rodents , an alternative explanation for the effect of light is acute stress or fear created by the aversion of rats to bright light . Although stress or fear can increase the spontaneous blink rate of alert humans , 40 these emotions can not explain the increased blink rate of anesthetized rats in bright light . Fear can increase the ampli-tude of trigeminal reflex blinks in alert animals , 41 whereas stress can have no effect42 or can depress reflex blink magni-tude.43 Fear , however , does not account for the increased reflex blink amplitude in anesthetized rats Figs . 1–3 , 6 . More-over , the decreased blink amplitude produced by stress42,43 is A B 3 Amplitude 2 OOemg 1 Relative C 8 min 6 blinks 4 Rate Blink 2 in contrast to the increased reflex blink amplitude produced by light . The simplest explanation for the effects of bright light on reflex and spontaneous blinking shared by humans and rodents is that bright light activates similar neural circuits in the two species . There is abundant evidence that photophobia involves in-teractions between the trigeminal system and portions of the central visual system that receive inputs from melanopsin-containing retinal ganglion cells such as the pretectal olivary nucleus.19,22 One circuit involved in photophobia is a projec-tion of melanopsin-containing retinal ganglion cells to tha-lamic nuclei that receive nociceptive inputs from the spinal trigeminal system.19 This mechanism can account for the ability of light to exacerbate the pain experienced by mi-graineurs.17,18,44,45 Through a mechanism involving the pre-tectal olivary nucleus , bright light increases choroidal blood flow.46,47 Another circuit supporting photophobia is the acti-vation of spinal trigeminal nociceptive neurons by choroidal vessel dilation . Thus , a bright light indirectly activates spinal trigeminal nociceptors.22,48 This mechanism can explain why trigeminal nociceptor sensitization increases the painful quality of bright light.14,18,49,50 In addition to these processes involv-ing central nervous system visual centers , our data reveal an intraretinal process modulating the trigeminal system to pro-duce the ocular discomfort associated with bright light . Although we have not identified this intraretinal mecha-nism , associational ganglion cells are a candidate for affecting trigeminal activity independent of central visual pathways . The axons of associational ganglion cells do not enter the optic nerve . Instead they extend into the retinal periphery near the pars plana of the ciliary body.51 This region is richly innervated with trigeminal nociceptors.52–57 Associational ganglion cells may directly activate trigeminal nociceptors to sensitize spinal trigeminal nucleus neurons . An indirect activation of trigeminal nociceptors could occur if associational ganglion cell activity modulates uveal blood flow , which in turn activates trigeminal nociceptors associated with these blood vessels.53,55,56 In pri-mates and cats , associational ganglion cells terminate on peri-cytes surrounding retinal blood vessels.51 Regardless of the mechanism , the data demonstrate that trigeminal blink en-hancement by light can occur after optic nerve lesion and is an additional pathway through which light and the trigeminal system interact to create photophobia . Thus , blind persons may experience photophobia independently of central visual pathways .

Depression was assessed using the Ko-rean version of the Short Geriatric Depression Scale SGDS-K . The association between DED and depression was evaluated using logistic linear analyses . RESULTS . The SGDS-K score correlated with the number of positive responses in the Dry Eye Questionnaire r 0.229 , P 0.001 , but not with tear film break-up time r 0.041 , P 0.139 or Schirmer test score r 0.048 , P 0.642 . In the binary logistic regression model , female sex P 0.014 , residence in urban areas P 0.001 , depression P 0.001 , and Schirmer score of 5 mm P 0.035 were associated with the risk of DED . Depression was associated with the risk of DED P 0.001 in the patients with Schirmer score 5 mm but not in those with Schirmer score 5 mm P 0.290 . CONCLUSIONS . Depression was associated with DED symptoms in subjects with normal or mildly reduced tear production . Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci . 2011 52 7954–7958 DOI 10.1167 iovs.11-8050 Dadversedisease ry eye DED is a common condition which has an effect on daily life.1 Along with ocular signs of effect on daily life.1 Along with ocular signs of tear film instability and ocular surface damage , dry eye symp-toms such as dryness , discomfort , foreign body sensation , and pain are included in all DED definitions.2–4 Thus , proper eval-uation of DED symptom severity is crucial in its diagnosis and management . However , it has been reported that subjective ocular symptom severity often does not correlate with that of ocular signs in DED this may be partly attributed to decreases in corneal sensation from persistent stimulation of the neural reflex arc in chronic DED.5,6 In addition , subjective ocular symptoms can be affected not only by tear film instability or ocular surface damage , but also by characteristics of individual pain perception or psychosomatic aspects including depres-sion , stress , and anxiety.7,8 Female sex , age , and hormonal influence are well estab-lished risk factors for both DED and depression.9,10 Literature has suggested that dry eye symptoms and mood status may influence each other.7,8 Vriezekolk et al.8 demonstrated that depression , fatigue , and pain were common in patients with primary Sjo ¨gren syndrome . Other researchers also revealed that depressive mood is one of the underlying causes of sub-jective dry mouth.11–13 However , few reports have shown a relationship between depression and DED.14,15 The aim of this study was to investigate the association between depression and DED in randomly selected community-dwelling elders . We also sought to evaluate the impact of comorbid depression on the agreement of DED signs and symptoms . Disclosure K.W. Kim , None S.B. Han , None E.R. Han , None S.J. Woo , None J.J.

Subjects with Schirmer scores 5 mm were more prevalent in the DED group than in the non-DED group P 0.042 . However , the frequencies of other DED signs including a flu-orescein score 1 and meibomian gland dysfunction were comparable between the two groups . DISCUSSION In the present study , we demonstrated that comorbid depres-sion is closely related to dry eye symptoms but not with dry eye signs Table 3 . Moreover , the association of depression with dry eye symptoms was differential by the presence of dry eye signs the association was significant in the high Schirmer score group but not in the low Schirmer score group . Recent studies by Galor et al.14 and Wang et al.15 demon-strated the association between DED and depression , which is in good agreement with the findings of our study . However , the studies were conducted retrospectively , and the diagnosis of DED and depression was based on International Classifica-tion of Disease Ninth Revision ICD-9 code , which limited the accuracy of the diagnosis.14,15 Moreover , the severity of DED and depression was never evaluated . In the present study , we determined the presence of DED and depression using the symptom questionnaire , which enabled more accurate diagno-sis of the two diseases . The cross-sectional nature of our study also enabled the evaluation of the current status of DED and depression . In addition , we determined the severity of DED using the ophthalmologic examination and symptom question-naire , and evaluated the correlation between the severities of the two diseases . Multivariate analyses revealed that depression is an indepen-dent risk factor for DED . However , the association between depression and symptomatic DED was confined to subjects with Schirmer score 5 mm , indicating that depression may play a key role in the development of dry eye symptoms in subjects with normal or mildly decreased tear production . Therefore , the symptom-sign discrepancy in DED , which is common in both clinical and research settings , may be attrib-uted at least in part to comorbid depression in DED patients . Several mechanisms may underlie the association between depression and dry eye symptoms , although they are unclear and yet to be determined . First , the two diseases may have common pathophysiology . The two diseases have common risk factors including female sex and menopause , suggesting the involvement of sex hormones in both diseases.18,19 In addition , inflammation plays a crucial role in the development of DED , 20 and the anti-inflammatory potential of -3 polyun-saturated fatty acids PUFAs has been shown to be helpful in alleviating dry eye signs and symptoms.21,22 Interestingly , many researchers have reported decreased levels of -3 poly-unsaturated fatty acids in patients with depression.23–26 More-over , an increased -6 -3 ratio in the diet has been suggested to be an important cause of the increased incidence of both DED and major depression.21,22,27,28 An increased -6 -3 ratio promotes the production of proinflammatory cytokines includ-ing interleukin IL -1 , IL-6 , and tumor necrosis factor TNF -.29 These cytokines provoke ocular surface inflammation in DED and produce and enhance negative moods by affecting neurotransmissions and signal transductions.29 Therefore , in-creased production of inflammatory cytokines may be a cause overlapped in the pathogenesis of the two diseases . As both conditions were known to have multifactorial pathogene-ses , 1,30 we can assume that the two diseases often coexist , especially in the patients with high -6 -3 ratio . Therefore , further studies are needed to investigate the influence of di-etary fatty acids on comorbidity of the two diseases . Second , a depressive mood may aggravate dry eye symptoms . Several researchers have revealed that chronic or longer-term depres-sion itself can enhance both acute and chronic proinflamma-tory cytokine production , which can worsen DED.31,32 Kiecolt-Glaser et al.23 demonstrated that the combination of higher level of depressive symptoms and increased -6 -3 ratio can markedly promote the production of proinflammatory cyto-kines beyond the contribution provided by either variable alone . In addition , depressive subjects may have a lower threshold for perceiving physical discomfort or pain . Kim et al.33 recently demonstrated that , at the same stage of osteoar-thritis , patients with depression complained of more severe pain than those without depression , suggesting the influence of the depressive mood on the pain perception . Likewise , depressive patients might be more prone to feel dry eye symp-toms . Moreover , somatization may play a role in aggravating dry eye symptoms . Somatization is a common condition in depression , that has been documented in up to 80 % of pa-tients.34 The results that depression was closely related to dry eye symptoms but not to dry eye signs supports the idea that DED may be , at least in part , a somatization disorder . Third , dry eye symptoms also can aggravate depressive symptoms . Chronic discomfort and visual impairment caused by dry eye symptoms can often be annoying , and can conceivably worsen depression.9,21 The present study has several limitations . First , history re-garding systemic medication was not investigated . Systemic medications including antidepressants , antianxiety medica-tions , antihistamines , diuretics , and antibenign prostate hyper-trophy medications were reported to be associated with DED.14,15 However , no significant correlation was found be-tween Schirmer and SGDS-K scores Table 1 . Moreover , the association between DED and depression was significant only in the high Schirmer score group this suggests that the influ-ence of systemic medications was not critical Fig. 1 . How-ever , we believe that the thorough investigation of systemic medication history is necessary in further studies to rule out possible compounding effects.14 Second , 62.0 % 657 1060 of the subjects enrolled in the study sample participated in the initial survey , and only 21.2 % 139 657 of them underwent secondary ophthalmologic examinations . This fact may raise a concern about selection bias , although we used the following measures to avoid bias in the initial survey , specific statements about DED or depression were never included in the invitation letter all 657 subjects who finished the initial survey were invited for the second step of the study and in the second step , the diagnostic status of DED was masked to the examiner as well as to all participants . However , multivariate analyses re-vealed the association between the two diseases Table 2 . The SGDS-K score correlated with the number of positive re-sponses in the DEQ Table 1 , suggesting the correlation be-tween severity of the depressive mood and that of DED symp-toms . Moreover , the DED symptoms and depression were evaluated in the initial survey , thus the possible bias due to the small number of participants in the second step had little influence on the determination of association between symp-tom-based DED and depression . Therefore , we believe that the results demonstrate the association between the two diseases , regardless of the bias . Third , because of the cross-sectional nature , this study could not show a causal relationship . It remains unclear whether depression is a predisposing factor of DED , or vice versa , although we believe that both conditions have an influence on each other . Fourth , the severity of dry eye symptoms was represented by the number of positive re-sponses to DEQ . Subjective symptoms may be better quantified using tools including the visual analog scale and the ocular surface disease index score.35,36 However , considering that participants were elders who often have difficulty answering excessive numbers of questions , we evaluated the symptom grade indirectly rather than adding another questionnaire . Fifth , our diagnostic criteria of DED have still limited value . As the lack of association between DED signs and symptoms is well reported , 37–41 we selected the symptom-based diagnostic criteria as did the recent population-based studies.9,17,39,42,43 However , our DEQ may not be specific for DED and also be reflective of other ocular surface diseases including MGD , allergic and chronic infectious conjunctivitis.9 Moreover , some dry eye symptoms might not be included in our DEQ.9 There-fore , the development of more accurate diagnostic criteria for DED is necessary.9 Finally , we did not control for contact lens wear , which is an important risk factor of DED . However , this study included only subjects aged 65 years or older , among which the number of contact lens wearer could be negligible in Korea . In conclusion , depression was associated with dry eye symptoms in subjects with normal or mildly decreased tear production . These results suggest that depression could be one of the aggravating factors for dry eye symptoms . Thus , screen-ing and management of comorbid depression may be helpful , particularly in subjects with severe dry eye symptoms which are not in accord with mild dry eye signs .

21896864	PURPOSE . To investigate the involvement of -like ligand Dll 4 in the development of experimental autoimmune uveoretinitis EAU in B10.RIII mice . METHODS . B10.RIII mice were immunized with interphotore-ceptor retinoid binding protein IRBP peptide 161–180 in complete Freund’s adjuvant together with intraperitoneal in-jection of Bordetella pertussis toxin . mRNA expressions of Notch receptors and their ligands in the eye were evaluated . To investigate the involvement of Dll in EAU , anti-Dll1 , anti-Dll4 , or control antibody Ab was intraperitoneally injected during both the induction and the effector phases or only the effector phase . Alternatively , mice were intraperitoneally in-jected with -secretase inhibitor GSI or the control vehicle during the induction phase . Fourteen days after immunization , the eyes and spleens were harvested . The eyes were used for histologic and or cytokine mRNA expression analysis , whereas the spleens were used for flow cytometric analysis , and anti-gen-recall proliferation and cytokine assays . RESULTS . Expression of Notch1 , 2 , 4 , and Dll4 in the eye were upregulated by EAU induction . Anti-Dll4 Ab treatment during both the induction and effector phases , but not only the effec-tor phase , significantly reduced the severity of EAU . IFN - , IL-12p35 , IL-17A , and TGF-mRNA expression in the eye were significantly attenuated by treatment with anti-Dll4 Ab . Spleno-cytes from anti-Dll4 Ab-treated mice showed significantly less proliferation and IL-17 production on antigen stimulation . Also , the severity of EAU was significantly reduced by -secretase inhibitor treatment during the induction phase . CONCLUSIONS . Dll4-mediated Notch signaling during the sensiti-zation is critical for the development of EAU . This can be a novel prophylactic target for autoimmune uveitis . Invest Oph-thalmol Vis Sci . 2011 52 8224–8230 DOI 10.1167 iovs.11-7756 Udamagea veitis , form of intraocular inflammation , causes retinal that can result in blindness in severe cases.1 De - that can result in blindness in severe cases.1 De-pending on the etiology , uveitis can be classed as endogenous or exogenous.2 Because endogenous uveitis is accompanied by systemic autoimmune conditions , the underlying mechanisms are thought to be autoimmune in nature.3 This is further supported by the fact that experimental autoimmune uveoreti-nitis EAU , a model of human uveitis , can be induced by immunization with retinal autoantigens in adjuvants.4,5 EAU can be also induced by the adoptive transfer of antigen Ag -specific T-cells , 6 indicating that EAU is a T-cell-mediated dis-ease . Of the various T-cell subsets , IFN -- producing Th1 cells7,8 and IL-17-producing Th17 cells9,10 appear to be the key players in EAU development . The involvement of T-cells in EAU has been investigated by modulating the level of T-cell activation . One way of achieving this is by treating animals with antibodies Abs specific for costimulatory molecules . Shao et al. demonstrated that stimu-lation of 4–1BB by treatment with agonistic anti-4–1BB Abs significantly suppressed EAU when the treatment was given during the sensitization period.11 Usui et al. reported that inducible costimulator and or B7-related protein-1 interactions are crucial for EAU development.12 Thus , it appears that co-stimulatory molecules participate in the induction of EAU . Notch , a family of four heterodimeric transmembrane re-ceptors , regulates cell fate decisions during the development of many organs.13 Notch signaling is initiated by the interaction between the receptor and a ligand from the Jagged or Delta family.14 Among its various properties , Notch is also involved in the induction of peripheral T-cell responses . Although the effects of Notch signaling on T-cell activation , proliferation , and polarization remain unclear , T-cell polarization and the resulting cytokine profiles may depend on the ligand that interacts with the Notch receptor.15–19 For example , Jagged1 promotes IL-4 expression and stimulates T helper cell 2 Th2 responses , 15 whereas -like ligand Dll 1 and Dll4 induce dif-ferentiation along a Th1 pathway.17,19 In accordance with the latter notion , we previously demonstrated that treatment with an anti-Dll4 Ab exacerbates the severity of Th2-mediated ex-perimental allergic conjunctivitis by downregulating Th1 cyto-kines and upregulating Th2 cytokines.20 The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of Dll4 in the development of Th1 and or Th17-mediated EAU .

TABLE 1 . Cell Compartments in the Spleen RESULTS Kinetic Changes of Notch Receptors and Their Ligands in the Eyes during the Development of EAU To investigate the kinetic changes of Notch receptors and their ligands expressed in the eye , mRNA expressions of Notch receptors and their ligands were evaluated by qRT-PCR . Ex-pression of Notch1 , 2 , 4 , and Dll4 were significantly upregu-lated 28 days after EAU induction Fig. 1 . Expression of Dll1 and Dll4 in Naïve Splenocytes To determine which types of cells express Dll1 and Dll4 , splenocytes were collected from naïve mice and were sub-jected for flow cytometric analysis . Percentages of Dll1 CD11c and Dll1 F4 80 cell compartment were 2.13 0.53 % and 2.09 0.66 % , respectively Fig. 2 . Percentages of Dll4 CD11c and Dll4 F4 80 cell compartment were 1.27 0.29 % and 1.55 0.44 % , respectively Fig. 2 . Administration of Anti-Dll4 Ab during Both the Induction and Effector Phases Suppresses the Severity of EAU To investigate whether Dll1 and Dll4 participate in the devel-opment of EAU , mice immunized with IRBP peptide were treated with anti-Dll1 Ab , anti-Dll4 Ab , or nhIgG during both the induction and effector phases . Inflammatory cell infiltration and destruction of the retinal structure were both less marked in anti-Dll4 Ab-treated mice Fig. 3A . Treatment with anti-Dll4 Ab , but not anti-Dll1 Ab , significantly suppressed the histologic score of EAU Fig. 3B . Therefore , differences in immunologic parameters between the nhIgG-treated group and the anti-Dll4 Ab-treated group were investigated . Cytokine mRNA Expression in the Eye Because IFN-and IL-17 play pivotal roles in the develop-ment of EAU , qRT-PCR analysis was performed to evaluate the cytokine expression levels in the eye . The expression of IFN - , IL-12p35 , IL-17A , and TGF-were significantly atten-uated in the anti-Dll4 Ab-treated group compared with the nhIgG-treated group , whereas the levels of IL-4 , IL-6 , IL-17F , and Rorc were not significantly different between the two groups Fig. 4 . Administration of Anti-Dll4 Ab during Both the Induction and Effector Phases Does Not Affect the Cell Populations within the Spleen To investigate how the intraperitoneal injection of anti-Dll4 Ab affected systemic immune responses , the effects of anti-Dll4 Ab treatment on specific splenocyte populations within the spleen were investigated . The percentage of CD3 T-cells , CD4 T-cells , B220 B-cells , F4 80 macrophages , and CD4 CD25 regulatory T-cells within the total splenocyte populations did not significantly differ between the nhIgG-treated and the anti-Dll4 Ab-treated groups Table 1 , n 6 per group . Administration of Anti-Dll4 Ab during Both the Induction and Effector Phases Suppresses Ag-Specific Proliferation and IL-17 Production of Splenocytes Ag IRBP peptide -specific proliferation and cytokine produc-tion of splenocytes was also examined . Ag-specific prolifera-tion of splenocytes from mice injected with anti-Dll4 Ab was significantly lower than that from the nhIgG-treated mice at the concentrations of 5 and 25 g mL of IRBP peptide Fig. 5A . With regard to cytokines , Ag-specific IL-17A production was significantly suppressed in splenocytes from anti-Dll4 Ab-treated mice Fig. 5E , whereas production of IL-2 , IL-4 , IL-5 , IL-10 , IL-12p70 , IL-13 , and IFN-was not significantly affected Figs . 5B–5D , 5F–5I . To investigate whether Dll4 participates in the development of EAU during the effector phase , mice immunized with the IRBP peptide were treated with anti-Dll4 Ab or nhIgG every other day from Day 8 to Day 12 . Inflammatory cell infiltration and destruction of the retinal structure were observed at a similar level between the two groups of mice Fig. 6A . Histologic grading of EAU confirmed that the severity of EAU was not significantly different between the two groups Fig. 6B . Ex-pression levels of cytokine mRNA in the eye and Ag-specific cytokine production by splenocytes did not differ between the two groups data not shown . The effect of Notch inhibition on EAU induction was investi-gated . GSI was administered to EAU-induced mice during the induction phase from Day 3 to Day 2 and inflammatory cell infiltration and destruction of retinal structures were exam-ined . The results show that both were less marked in GSI-treated mice compared with controls Fig. 7A . In addition , the EAU score was significantly reduced after treatment with GSI Fig. 7B . DISCUSSION The results of the present study show that treatment with anti-Dll4 Ab during both the induction and effector phases or treatment with GSI during the induction phase significantly suppressed the severity of EAU . In contrast , treatment with anti-Dll4 Ab during the effector phase did not affect the sever-ity of EAU . Taken together , it appears that the Dll4-mediated Notch signaling is critical for EAU development during the induction phase . The mechanism underlying suppression of EAU by treat-ment with anti-Dll4 Ab during both the induction and effector phases may be mediated by attenuation of Ag-specific T-cell proliferation and IL-17 production , because IL-17-producing Th17 cells play a crucial role in EAU development.9,10 Recently identified innate lymphoid cells ILCs represent a novel family of hematopoietic effectors participating in innate immune re-sponses.23 Interestingly , it was revealed that ILCs produce IL-5 , IL-13 , IL-17 , and IL-22 which are cytokines produced by a certain subset of T-cells.23 Thus , it remains to be determined whether decreased production of IL-17 is due to suppressed function of ILCs . With regard to the relationship between IL-17 production and EAU , it was recently demonstrated that by using TCR-knockout mice , T-cells play a crucial role in the generation and activation of IL-17-producing autoreactive T-cells which mediate EAU.24 More recently , the same group further eluci-dated that T-cells regulate the generation of TCR IL-17 producing uveitogenic T-cells.25 It was also reported that NK1.1 cells play a role in the development of EAU . Depletion of NK1.1 NK cells by injection of anti-CD161c Ab attenuated the severity of EAU.26 Additionally , NKT-cells are identified to regulate the development of EAU through inhibition of IL-17 production.27,28 Thus , it appears that T-cells , NK cells , and NKT-cells play a major role in the development of IL-17-medi-ated EAU . We found that the proportion of these cell compart-ments in splenocytes was not significantly affected by anti-Dll4 Ab treatment data not shown . However , it is possible that these cells may be affected functionally by treatment with anti-Dll4 Ab . Further studies are necessary to evaluate whether anti-Dll4 Ab affect the function of T-cells , NK cells , and NKT-cells . As described above , both Dll1 and Dll4 induce differentia-tion along a Th1 pathway.17,19 However , the results of the present study showed that Ag-specific IFN-production by splenocytes was not significantly suppressed by anti-Dll4 Ab treatment . Recently , it was shown that Dll4 regulated initial stages of Th2 differentiation and Th2 cytokine production in established allergic responses.29 We also previously demon-strated that anti-Dll4 Ab treatment increased Th2 cytokine production in experimental allergic conjunctivitis.20 In this study , however , anti-Dll4 Ab treatment did not affect Th2 cytokine production by splenocytes . Taken together , these results suggest that treatment with anti-Dll4 Ab was less likely to affect systemic Th1 Th2 balance , which then affects the severity of EAU . In contrast to splenocytes , IFN-production in the eye at Day 14 of EAU was significantly suppressed by anti-Dll4 Ab treatment . The discrepancy of IFN-levels be-tween the spleen and the eye remains to be elucidated . Be-cause IL-17A and IL-17F are detectable in the eye during the early stages of EAU and IFN-is detected later , 30 IL-17-produc-ing Th17 cells can be the initiator and IFN -- producing Th1 cells are the secondary infiltrating cells in EAU induced by CFA immunization.31 Therefore , it can be considered that systemic attenuation of Ag-specific Th17 cells by anti-Dll4 Ab treatment led to the reduction of secondary Th1 influx into the eye . IL-17-producing Th17 cells play a pivotal role in EAU devel-opment.9,10 In terms of the relationship between Dll and IL-17 , it was reported that Dll4 enhanced the differentiation of Th17 cells because Dll4 upregulated Rorc expression in T-cells and both the Rorc and Il17 gene promoters are direct transcrip-tional targets for Notch.32 Indeed , the results of the present study show that treatment with anti-Dll4 Ab significantly down-regulated IL-17A mRNA expression in the eye and Ag-specific IL-17A production by splenocytes in EAU-induced mice . It was also demonstrated that Dll4 influences the generation of IL-17-producing T-cells in the presence of additional skewing cyto-kines , IL-6 , and TGF-.32 Thus , reduced expression of TGF-mRNA in the eye may also be involved in downregulation of IL-17 mRNA expression in the eye . More recently , it was shown that anti-Dll4 mAb treatment decreased IL-17 mRNA expression in mice with Theiler’s murine encephalomyelitis virus-induced demyelinating disease.33 Taken together , our data here further support the notion that Dll4-mediated Notch signaling is criti-cal for Th17 differentiation and the development of Th17-mediated autoimmune disease . In addition to T-cells , both Notch receptors and ligands are expressed also in dendritic cells DC and bacterial products not only upregulate the expression of Notch ligands in DC15 but also can activate Notch signaling in macrophages.34 Thus , Notch signaling in innate immune cells may also participate in the induction and perpetuation of EAU . We found that Dll1 and Dll4 are expressed , although not abundantly , in CD11c and F4 80 splenocytes from naïve B10.RIII mice . It was recently demonstrated that Notch signaling initiated by Jagged1 , but not Dll1 or Dll4 , induced the maturation of DC.35 Thus , it is unlikely that anti-Dll4 Ab treatment affected DC maturation and cytokine production in this study . It remains to be elucidated how Dll4 molecules in F4 80 cells participate in the develop-ment of EAU . Factors that cause enhanced or decreased ex-pression of Dll molecules have not been investigated exten-sively , although it was recently reported that IL-33 induced a significant decrease in Dll4 mRNA expression in the mucosa of BALB c mice.36 Further studies are necessary to determine the factors to affect expression of Dll molecules . As previously reported , inhibition of Notch signaling by GSI suppressed Th1 immune responses and the development of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis EAE .37 Later , Jurynczyk et al. demonstrated that selective inhibition of Notch3 , but not Notch1 , abrogated both the Th1 and Th17 responses of proteolipid protein-reactive effector T-cells in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis.38 In the present study , EAU-induced mice were treated with GSI to examine the involvement of Notch in EAU development . In agreement with the data obtained by anti-Dll4 Ab treatment during both the induction and effector phases , GSI treatment significantly sup-pressed the severity of EAU . Importantly , GSI treatment was given only during the sensitization period from Day 3 to Day 2 of EAU induction . Together with the data showing that treatment with anti-Dll4 Ab during the effector phase alone did not affect the severity of EAU , it appears that the signal through Notch is important for Ag sensitization in EAU development . Furthermore , these data suggest that the mechanism underly-ing the suppression of EAU by anti-Dll4 Ab treatment is , at least in part , due to inhibition of Notch signaling . In conclusion , Dll4-mediated Notch signaling during the induction phase is critical for the development of EAU . Be-cause anti-Dll4 Ab treatment suppressed the induction of Ag-specific Th17 cells and the development of EAU , Dll4 has a potential as a prophylactic target for T-cell mediated sight-threatening intraocular inflammatory diseases such as uveitis .

21896868	PURPOSE . Transgenic pigs carrying a mutant human rhodopsin transgene have been developed as a large animal model of retinitis pigmentosa RP . This model displays some key fea-tures of human RP , but the time course of disease progression makes this model costly , time consuming , and difficult to study because of the size of the animals at end-stage disease . Here , the authors evaluate an iodoacetic acid IAA model of photo-receptor degeneration in the pig as an alternative model that shares features of the transgenic pig and human RP . METHODS . IAA blocks glycolysis , thereby inhibiting photorecep-tor function . The effect of the intravenous injection of IAA on swine rod and cone photoreceptor viability and morphology was followed by histologic evaluation of different regions of the retina using hematoxylin and eosin and immunostaining . Rod and cone function was analyzed by full-field electroreti-nography and multifocal electroretinography . RESULTS . IAA led to specific loss of rods in a central-to-periph-eral retinal gradient . Although cones were resistant , they showed shortened outer segments , loss of bipolar cell synaptic connections , and a diminished flicker ERG , hallmarks of tran-sition to cone dysfunction in RP patients . CONCLUSIONS . IAA provides an alternative rod-dominant model of retinal damage that shares a surprising number of features with the pig transgenic model of RP and with human RP . This IAA model is cost-effective and rapid , ensuring that the size of the animals does not become prohibitive for end-stage evalua-tion or therapeutic intervention . Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci . 2011 52 7917–7923 DOI 10.1167 iovs.11-7849 Ration etinitis pigmentosa RP and age-related macular degener-AMD represent two major retinal degenerative dis - AMD represent two major retinal degenerative dis-eases that lead progressively to blindness . Both RP and AMD target photoreceptors constituting the outer retina . Unlike lower vertebrates , the retina in higher vertebrates , including humans , is not significantly regenerated after injury or disease , leading to an interest in stem cell transplantation therapy to restore damaged photoreceptors . The cause of AMD has yet to be uncovered , although a role for the complement system has been documented experimentally and genetically , 1,2 and an animal model that faithfully recapitulates the human disease is not available . RP represents a collection of genetic diseases , many of which are associated with mutation of the rod-specific opsin rhodopsin RHO .3–5 Rods are lost in RP patients , leading to diminished night vision and progressive narrowing of the visual field as vision becomes totally dependent on cones , which are concentrated in the fovea.4 Eventually , foveal cones lose function and central vision is lost . One of the first indica-tions of impending loss of cone function is a diminished flicker ERG , which assesses the temporal response of cones to rapid flashes of light.6 This diminished flicker ERG is accompanied by a decrease in the length of cone outer segments , which contain cone opsins.7 Mouse genetic models have been created for RP , 8–10 but these models are not entirely representative of the clinical phenotype in RP patients . The mouse retina is rod-dominant with few cones , and these cones are not organized into a central fovea as in the human eye.11,12 As with humans , the swine retina contains a cone-dominant central visual streak with rods enriched in the peripheral retina.13,14 Thus , the swine retina is a much closer anatomic and physiological match to the human retina , leading to interest in the pig as a model of human retinal disease . To this end , a mutant human RHO transgene has been expressed in pigs to create a large animal model of RP.15,16 In these pigs rod cell death was evident by 2 weeks of age it became more pronounced by 6 weeks , and most rods degenerated by 9 months.16 This rod loss occurred in a central-to-peripheral gradient.15 Although this transgenic model shows features of human RP , the time course for end-stage disease results in very large animals that are difficult to handle . Beyond simply the time commitment and large animal size at end-stage disease , the need to maintain a transgenic colony makes this model costly to pursue for stem cell transplantation experiments . Several chemical models have been used to damage the retina . Sodium iodate damages the retinal pigment epithelium , and as a secondary effect to the loss of pigment epithelium , the underlying photoreceptors are lost.17–19 By contrast , iodo-acetic acid IAA covalently modifies and inhibits glyceralde-hyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase GAPDH , thereby blocking glycolysis.20,21 Neurons depend on glycolysis for adenosine triphosphate production , and photoreceptors in the retina have been shown previously to be particularly sensitive to IAA because of their high metabolic rate.22 Indeed , it has been demonstrated that photoreceptors are lost while inner retinal Disclosure W.

Here , we examined the effects of IAA on photoreceptor via-bility and function in the pig to determine whether it might recapitulate some of the features of RP . We found that rods were specifically targeted by IAA in a central-to-peripheral fashion , as in the RHO transgenic pig model.6,25 Further , cones were resistant to IAA , leading to a monolayer of cones retaining shortened outer segments in the outer nuclear layer ONL . These cones were still functional , but they showed a diminished response in the flicker ERG . These results suggest that IAA in the pig can serve as a model for specific loss of rods and that under these conditions cones survive but display a diminished electrophysiological response characteristic of the cells in RP patients . METHODS Animals and Treatment All methods were approved by the University of Louisville Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and adhered to the ARVO Statement Statistical Analysis Results are reported as mean SE . ANOVA and Student’s t-test were used for the determination of statistical significance among treatment groups . RESULTS IAA Causes a Central-to-Peripheral Gradient of Photoreceptor Loss without Affecting the Number of Inner Retinal Neurons IAA was injected into the ear veins of pigs at 6 to 8 weeks of age weight range , 12–16 kg at concentrations of 7.5 mg kg or 12 mg kg . After 12 weeks , the eyes were removed , and sagit-tally cut sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin Figs . 1A , 1B . We studied three areas of the retina the central retina 1 mm dorsal to the optic disc , the visual streak 2 mm superior to the optic disc , and the peripheral retina 1 mm posterior to the ora serrata . Nuclei located in the ONL were counted along a 100-m linear distance in each region Fig. 1C . Similar numbers of nuclei were evident in the ONL in each retinal area in the untreated animals . The ONL in the central retina and the streak was greatly diminished after injection of 7.5 mg kg IAA . Surprisingly , the ONL in the peripheral retina was only modestly diminished . Injection of 12 mg kg IAA also led to a similar loss of the ONL in the central retina and visual streak with only a modest loss in the peripheral retina . As a control , IAA had little effect on the number of inner nuclei located in the inner nuclear layer INL in any of the retinal regions Figs . 1A–C . Next , we asked whether IAA might have a differential effect on rod and cone photoreceptors . First , it was necessary to identify rod and cone cell nuclei within the ONL . Frozen sections of central and peripheral retina were immunostained for the rod specification transcription factor , neural retina leucine zipper protein NRL , which is present in rod nuclei.30 Sections were double immunostained for the cone-specific , long-wavelength opsin 1 OPN1LW and medium wavelength opsin 1 OPN1MW or for the short-wavelength S opsin OPNLSW the latter makes up approximately 16 % of the cones in the pig Supplementary Fig. S1 , http www.iovs.org lookup suppl doi 10.1167 iovs.11-7849 -DCSupplemental . NRL was uni-formly expressed in the nuclei of cells in the inner rows of the ONL , but the outermost rows of the ONL were devoid of NRL in both the central and the peripheral retina Figs . 2A–D Supplementary Fig. S1 , http www.iovs.org lookup suppl doi 10.1167 iovs.11-7849 -DCSupplemental . Accordingly , cell bodies in these outer rows of the ONL immunostained for cone opsins Figs . 2A–D Supplementary Fig. S1 , http www.iovs.org lookup suppl doi 10.1167 iovs.11-7849 -DCSupplemental . Cone outer segments OS also immuno-stained brightly for cone opsins , as did cone pedicles , the synaptic terminals between cones and cone bipolar cells Figs. 2A–D . In most species cones are concentrated in the outer half of the ONL , but these results demonstrate that in the pig cones are completely segregated from rods and that they constitute the outermost rows of the ONL this organi-zation is evident in both the central and the peripheral retina . The numbers of cone and rod nuclei were then counted in the central and peripheral retina . The number of cones was similar in these regions , but there were approximately 25 % fewer rods in the peripheral than in the central retina Figs . 3A , 3B . After IAA treatment , central and peripheral retina sections were immunostained for NRL and cone opsins to determine whether rods or cones were selectively affected by IAA Figs . 3A–C , 4 . The number of cones was not affected by either 7.5 mg kg or 12 mg kg IAA in either the central or the peripheral retina . By contrast , rods were dramatically dimin-ished in the central retina with 7.5 mg kg IAA , and they were even further diminished in this region with the 12-mg kg dose Figs . 3A–C , 4 . IAA had less effect on rod number in the peripheral retina . The 7.5-mg kg dose de-creased the number of rods by approximately 35 % in the peripheral retina , whereas the higher dose of 12 mg kg led to an approximately 70 % decrease in rod number . Next , we analyzed the time course of effect of IAA on rod number Fig. 3C . Rod number was diminished by 7.5 mg kg and 12 mg kg IAA 3 weeks after treatment . The number of rods decreased further by 5 weeks . Thus , the initial treatment with IAA and the resultant block in glycolysis led to a progressive loss of rods with time . Rods in the Peripheral Retina Show Diminished Outer Segments with RHO Redirected to Cell Bodies after IAA Treatment RHO is normally directed to rod outer segments , but it becomes redirected to cell bodies as rods lose OS in models of retinal degeneration . Although rods persisted in the pe-ripheral retina after IAA treatment , they showed an IAA concentration-dependent loss of OS with RHO redirected to cell bodies Fig. 4 . IAA Causes a Concentration-Dependent Loss of Cone OS , a Decrease in Cone OS Length , and a Loss of Cone Pedicles As noted , IAA did not affect cone cell number in either the central or the peripheral retina Figs . 3A–C , 4 . However , because IAA led to loss of OS on rods persisting in the periph-eral retina Fig. 4 , we wondered whether IAA might also be affecting cone OS . Coimmunostaining for NRL and cone L M opsin allowed identification of cone cell bodies , cone inner segments , and cone OS Fig. 5A . We then used such immuno-staining to assess cone OS number after IAA treatment . Al-though 7.5 mg kg IAA did not affect cone OS number in either the central or the peripheral retina , the higher dose of 12 mg kg IAA led to a dramatic loss of cone OS in the central retina , but cone OS was diminished only by approximately 50 % in the peripheral retina Fig. 5B . Cones are also relatively resistant in the pig transgenic model , expressing a mutant human RHO , but the remaining cones exhibit shortened OS.16 In human RP , shortened cone OS correlates with a diminished flicker ERG.31 Therefore , we used immunostaining , as in Figure 5A , to measure the length of cone OS after IAA treatment . Although the number of cone OS was not affected by 7.5 mg kg IAA , the length of cone OS was diminished by approximately 60 % in the central retina how - ever , this concentration of IAA had only a modest effect on cone OS length in the peripheral retina Fig. 5C . The 12-mg kg dose of IAA led to a dramatic decrease in cone OS length in both the central and the peripheral retina Fig. 5C . Along with the diminished number and length of cone OS after treatment with 12 mg kg IAA , cone pedicles were dimin-ished in a central-to-peripheral gradient Figs. 4 , 5D . By con-trast , cone pedicles were unaffected in either the central or the peripheral retina after the 7.5-mg kg dose of IAA Figs. 4 , 5D . The results demonstrate a dramatic loss of rods in the central retina after IAA injection , and rods that remained in the pe-riphery had diminished OS and redirected RHO to the cell bodies . These morphologic changes suggested that IAA caused a loss of rod function . Dark-adapted scotopic ff-ERG was used to assess rod function after IAA injection . We found that rod ERG signals were 20 % of untreated controls 2 weeks after injection of 7.5 mg kg IAA , and there was not significant change in the rod ERG out to 12 weeks Fig. 6 . In addition , the injection of 12 mg kg IAA led to a further diminished rod ERG signal , and this reduced signal remained constant until 12 weeks Fig. 6 . With both doses of IAA , rods were still evident histologically at 3 weeks Fig. 3C , but their loss of ERG by 2 weeks suggested they lost function before the cell bodies disappeared . Photopic ff-ERG was used to assess cone signaling after IAA injection . As with rod signals , the cone response was signifi-cantly diminished 2 weeks after IAA injection to approximately 20 % of control with the 7.5-mg kg concentration and to ap-proximately 10 % of control with the 12-mg kg concentration Fig. 6 . Unlike the rod response , which remained suppressed out to 12 weeks , the cone response rebounded to approxi-mately 50 % of control with 7.5 mg kg IAA and to approxi-mately 30 % of control with 12 mg kg IAA Fig. 6 . The photopic mf-ERG was used to assess the cone response on the visual streak near the central retina . As with the full-field response , the mf-ERG cone response was diminished with both 7.5 and 12 mg kg IAA 2 weeks after injection , and the response significantly rebounded to approximately 70 % of control with 7.5 mg kg IAA and to approximately 50 % of control with 12 mg kg IAA Fig. 6 . We were unable to assess the peripheral retina using the mf-ERG . Cones Show a Diminished Response in Flicker ERG after IAA Injection As noted , shortened OS and a diminished flicker ERG are early markers of loss of cone function in RP . We then examined the temporal response of cones to rapid flashes using flicker ERG . As with the photopic ff-ERG response Fig. 6 , the full-field flicker ERG response was diminished 2 weeks after IAA injec-tion , and it rebounded at 5 weeks and remained similar out to 12 weeks Fig. 6 . Nevertheless , overall flicker ERG was more diminished than the photopic ff-ERG , implying that the cones are less able to respond to the stress of the rapid temporal response imposed by flicker . Representative wave forms for ff-ERG , mf-ERG , and flicker ERG are shown in Supplementary Fig. S2 http www.iovs.org lookup suppl doi 10.1167 iovs . 11-7849 -DCSupplemental . DISCUSSION There is mounting interest in using the pig as a model for retinal disease and stem cell transplantation therapy . The RHO transgenic model recapitulates important features of the dis-ease , including selective loss of rods and the subsequent di-minished function of cones highlighted by shortened outer segments and diminished flicker ERG . However , this transgenic model is costly to maintain . By the time of end-stage disease at 9 months of age , the animals are very large weight 500 pounds , making assessment and stem cell transplantation dif-ficult . The IAA model we describe here shares a surprising num-ber of features with the transgenic model . Rods are lost after IAA treatment whereas cones are not this is similar to the rod-specific pattern of loss seen in the transgenic model15and in RP . In the transgenic model and RP patients , this rod sensi-tivity is logical because the RHO mutation is targeted to rods and the subsequent defects in cones are then secondary to rod loss . In the IAA model , there is a similar pattern of rod-specific loss , but this rod sensitivity is likely caused by differences in metabolic demands between rods and cones , with the cone defects a result of rod loss as in the transgenic model and in RP . Interestingly , there is a gradient of rod loss , with rods being eliminated in the central retina while the most peripheral retina is relatively unaffected after IAA . The reason for the relative resistance of rods in the peripheral retina is unclear , but this same pattern of rod resistance in the periphery is also seen in the RHO transgenic pig model.16,25 In addition , as in the transgenic model and in RP , cones that are retained after IAA exhibit shortened OS and , at the higher IAA concentra-tion , a loss of pedicles , and they display a reduced flicker ERG , implying that the cone signaling defects become more pro-nounced when the cells are challenged temporally with rapid flashes . ERG signals from rods were diminished at 2 weeks after IAA injection , and they remained diminished until 12 weeks . These results are consistent with the loss of rods that we observed histologically . By contrast , cone ERG signals dipped at 2 weeks after IAA injection but rebounded significantly by 5 weeks , and this recovery was maintained to 12 weeks . We suggest that the dip in response at 2 weeks reflects the initial covalent modifi-cation to GAPDH and the resultant block of glycolysis when IAA is injected.21,32,33 Although rods die from this initial block in glycolysis , cones do not . We suggest that once IAA is cleared , cones can resynthesize GAPDH and restore glycolysis and that the cone defects are likely a secondary result of the surrounding rod loss as discussed . Importantly , the time course for retinal changes seen with IAA is much more rapid than with the transgenic model , allowing for easy evaluation and surgery . Thus , the IAA model in the pig may provide a relatively rapid and cost-effective alternative swine model of rod degeneration and cone dysfunc-tion that can be easily manipulated and assessed in transplan-tation experiments . Such a model may then provide a means for collecting data and establishing experimental conditions that can , in turn , be applied to the transgenic model in more long-term experiments .

21896928	RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS—Sprague Dawley SD Dwide . iabetes and obesity are evolving as two of the major diseases of the 21st century , with a signif-icant increase in morbidity and mortality world-As a result , there is an increasing need to identify potential therapeutic targets for the management of these disorders . Sirtuin 1 SIRT1 is a NAD+-dependent protein deacetylase and a member of the group of mam-malian proteins collectively referred to as “sirtuins” SIRT1–7 . SIRT1 deacetylates several substrates , including transcription factors that are involved in multiple cellular processes , and is rapidly emerging as an important regulator of metabolism and aging 1 . SIRT1 is nutritionally regulated , and its ex-pression increases during caloric restriction and fasting 2,3 . As such , it provides a link between nutrient avail-ability and energy balance . Further , SIRT1 activation results in improved glucose tolerance , increased insulin secretion , and resistance to diet-induced obesity 4–7 . Thus , SIRT1 acts as a master metabolic sensor with the ability to in-tegrate environmental signals to the metabolic needs of the organism . Resveratrol , a plant-derived polyphenol commonly found in grapes and red wine , is an effective SIRT1 activator . Oral administration of resveratrol alleviates hyperglycemia and diet-induced obesity and improves mitochondrial function 8–10 . In addition , resveratrol enhances neuronal survival and reduces cerebral ischemia and neurodegenerative conditions in an SIRT1-dependent manner 11–13 . Other SIRT1 activators that are structurally distinct from resver-atrol have been developed , and studies have shown that they too demonstrate similar metabolic benefit 14–16 . Thus , SIRT1-activating molecules such as resveratrol show significant therapeutic potential for the management of metabolic disorders . The arcuate nucleus of the mediobasal hypothalamus MBH is a major center where signals involved in the determination of nutrient availability and energy balance converge . Our group and others have shown that hor-mones and nutrient substrates when acting centrally have a direct role in the acute regulation of insulin action 17–21 . Recent studies have revealed that SIRT1 is highly expressed and regulated in the MBH and that chronic intracerebroventricular administration of resveratrol re-duces diet-induced hyperglycemia 22,23 . In addition , hy-pothalamic SIRT1 appears to have a role in mediating energy balance 24,25 . However , the specific contribution of central SIRT1 to the effects of resveratrol on glucose metabolism has not been systematically investigated . In the studies presented , we have elucidated the specific effect of MBH resveratrol on glucose homeostasis and insulin action . We have also established that the effect of central resver-atrol on hepatic glucose production is mediated primarily in an SIRT1-dependent manner . Further , we have demon-strated that acute administration of resveratrol centrally or systemically effectively and consistently modulates glucose homeostasis . In addition , we have shown that the hypo-thalamic KATP channel and vagus nerve innervation to the liver are required for central resveratrol action on hepatic glucose production . RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Construction of SIRT1-specific short hairpin RNA and viral preparation . Infusion perfusion and tissue processing . Animals had stereotaxic surgery RNA analysis and quantitative real-time PCR . Gene expression of proo - RESULTS Expression and activation of SIRT1 in hypothalamic nuclei . To determine the role of MBH SIRT1 , we first ana-lyzed the expression of the protein in multiple hypothalamic nuclei in SD male rats by Western blot analysis . We found that SIRT1 expression is markedly increased in the arcuate nucleus of the MBH compared with the surrounding nuclei Fig. 1A . These findings are similar to those of recent reports in mice 22,25 . We then investigated the effect of acute MBH administration of resveratrol on SIRT1 activity . SD male rats received acute infusions of vehicle 5 % DMSO or resveratrol 200 mmol L . Acetylation of lysine 379 in p53 Acp53 was used as a marker of SIRT1 activity 14,36 . Resveratrol infusion resulted in the deacetylation of p53 primarily in the arcuate nucleus and the ventromedial hy-pothalamus . Neither resveratrol nor DMSO altered SIRT1 expression in the MBH Fig. 1B . The studies indicate that acute administration of resveratrol is effective in activating hypothalamic SIRT1 . Hypothalamic SIRT1 is essential for resveratrol’s effect on hepatic glucose production . Given the impor - tance of the MBH on the regulation of glucose homeostasis , we sought to determine its specific role on resveratrol action and the contribution of central SIRT1 . Bilateral cannulae were implanted by stereotaxic surgery into the MBH of SD male rats . After adequate postsurgical recovery , vehicle 5 % DMSO , CTRL or resveratrol RSV , 200 mmol L was infused into the MBH of conscious rats during basal pancreatic in-sulin clamp studies Fig. 2A . The resveratrol dose selected was used to achieve maximal SIRT1 activation as previously described 36 . Central resveratrol treatment significantly decreased the basal plasma glucose and basal insulin levels Fig. 2B , Supplementary Table 1 . In the resveratrol-treated animals , the glucose infusion rate GIR required to prevent hypoglycemia was approximately fourfold higher compared with the control group RSV 5.0 6 0.5 vs. CTRL 1.3 6 0.6 mg kg min P , 0.005 , whereas the endogenous glucose production was significantly lower RSV 5.9 6 0.7 vs. CTRL 11.1 6 0.8 mg kg min P , 0.005 . Overall , resveratrol sup-pressed glucose production by 55 6 5 versus 9 6 5 % in the control group . Peripheral glucose uptake was not different between the two treatment groups , as might be expected in studies performed under basal insulin conditions Fig. 2C–F . Thus , central resveratrol modulates glucose homeostasis by markedly repressing glucose output from the liver . To further delineate the contribution of hypothalamic SIRT1 to resveratrol action , we used an SIRT1-specific cell permeable inhibitor SI , 6-chloro-2,3,4,9-tetrahydro-1H-carbazole-1-carboxamide that has been shown to selectively decrease the catalytic activity of SIRT1 37,38 . Resveratrol 200 mmol L and the SIRT1 inhibitor SI , 500 nmol L were coinfused into the MBH of conscious rats during pancreatic insulin clamp studies . The SIRT1 inhibitor significantly attenuated the effect of resveratrol on GIR compared with resveratrol treatment alone RSV SI 1.8 6 0.4 vs. RSV 5.0 6 0.5 mg kg min P , 0.005 . In addition , the effect of resveratrol on reducing hepatic glucose production was significantly negated RSV SI 11.4 6 0.9 vs. RSV 5.9 6 0.7 mg kg min P , 0.005 Fig. 2C–F . Acute MBH infusion of the SIRT1 inhibitor alone showed no significant differ-ence on hepatic glucose production compared with con-trol Fig. 2C–F . Thus , selective inhibition of central SIRT1 is sufficient to block the effect of central resveratrol on glucose production . Flux through glucose-6-phosphatase G6Pase is the most distal step in hepatic glucose production , and this net flux is suppressed relative to any decrease in hepatic glucose production . Because the in vivo flux through G6Pase is through the net contribution of glucosyl units derived from gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis , we have estimated their relative contribution to ascertain how resveratrol-induced activation of central SIRT1 affects he-patic glucose output . In animals treated with MBH resver-atrol , the flux through G6Pase was significantly reduced , and this effect was markedly blunted with infusion of the SIRT1 inhibitor Fig. 2G . Resveratrol significantly re-duced the rate of glycogenolysis RSV 4.4 6 1.1 vs. CTRL 8.7 6 0.4 mg kg min P , 0.05 , and gluconeogenesis also was decreased RSV 1.4 6 0.3 vs. CTRL 2.5 6 0.2 mg kg min P , 0.05 . Coinfusion of the SIRT1 inhibitor reversed the effect of resveratrol on glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis Fig. 2H and I . Thus , acute activation of central SIRT1 by resveratrol suppresses glucose production through inhibition of glycogenolysis and to a lesser extent gluco-neogenesis . Recent reports have suggested that resveratrol’s ac-tions may be mediated through not only SIRT1 but also other targets , such as AMPK 8,39,40 . Resveratrol has been reported to activate AMPK in neuronal cell lines and in brain tissue in vivo 41 . We assessed whether there was any change in AMPK activation phosphorylation in the hypo-thalamus after treatment with resveratrol . AICAR , a known AMPK activator , was used as a positive control . Overall , we found no evidence of AMPK activation in resveratrol-treated animals . However , enhanced AMPK activation was observed after AICAR treatment Supplementary Fig. 1A . Thus , in our current study paradigm , we have no evidence of central AMPK activation after acute resveratrol admin-istration . A role for POMC and AgRP in mediating the effects of SIRT1 has been reported 24,25,42,43 . We assessed the expression of these neuropeptides after acute resveratrol administration and found that the mRNA expression of POMC and AgRP was not significantly different compared with control Supplementary Fig. 1B and C . SIRT1 knockdown significantly reduced the effect of resveratrol on glucose production . To provide confir - mation that central SIRT1 is essential for resveratrol action , we used an shRNA to selectively decrease SIRT1 expres-sion . In cell culture , SIRT1 silencing was verified to be at least 50 % by Western blot analysis Fig. 3A . Immunohis-tochemical analysis confirmed that hypothalamic injection of the SIRT1-shRNA in rats reduced SIRT1 expression in the MBH compared with control Fig. 3B , Supplementary Fig. 2A–C . Lower-magnification photomicrographs further confirmed that SIRT1 silencing was restricted to the me-dial portion of the arcuate nucleus because regions rostral and caudal did not show any significant difference in SIRT1 expression between control and SIRT1-shRNA– treated groups Supplementary Fig. 2D–I . In preparation for the clamp studies , control-shRNA or SIRT1-shRNA was injected into the MBH immediately after implantation of the hypothalamic cannulae . This was followed by vascular catheterization and clamp studies after 2 weeks Fig. 3C and D . There were no significant differences between the baseline metabolic characteristics of the control-shRNA and the SIRT1-shRNA group Supplementary Table 2 . When animals treated with the control virus or SIRT1-shRNA was infused with vehicle 5 % DMSO during the clamp study , there was no significant change in hepatic glucose pro-duction or glucose uptake between the groups . Resveratrol treatment reduced hepatic glucose production in animals who received the control-shRNA . However , similar to the cell-permeable SIRT1 inhibitor , treatment with the SIRT1-shRNA significantly blocked the effect of resveratrol on hepatic glucose production , resulting in an approximately twofold reduction of the GIR Fig. 3E–H . Treatment with the SIRT1-shRNA had no effect on AgRP expression , but a slight increase in POMC expression was observed Supplementary Fig. 2J and K . Taken together , the data indicate that resveratrol mediates its effect on glucose production through an SIRT1-dependent pathway and that inhibition of central SIRT1 by using a cell-permeable inhibitor or shRNA silencing is sufficient to blunt the effect of resveratrol on hepatic glucose metabolism . Blockade of the hypothalamic KATP channel significantly reduced the effect of resveratrol . Activa - tion of the hypothalamic KATP channel has been shown to lower hepatic glucose production in response to hormonal stimuli , such as leptin , insulin , and nutritional substrates , whereas blockade of the KATP channel with sulfonylureas has the opposite effect 19,28,44 . Thus , we asked whether resveratrol’s action on glucose production was dependent on KATP activation Fig. 4A . SD male rats received MBH infusion of vehicle 5 % DMSO , resveratrol 200 mmol L , a coinfusion of resveratrol 200 mmol L , and the KATP in-hibitor glibenclamide 100 mmol L or glibenclamide alone 100 mmol L during basal pancreatic clamp study Fig. 4B . We found that IH infusion of glibenclamide significantly re-versed the effect of resveratrol on hepatic glucose pro-duction in a manner that was similar to what was observed with the SIRT1-specific inhibitor . However , glibenclamide alone had no appreciable effect compared with vehicle-treated controls Fig. 4C–F . These findings suggest that the acute effects of resveratrol on hepatic glucose production are dependent on the activation of KATP channels in the MBH . Hepatic vagus nerve innervation is important for resveratrol action . Previous work from our laboratory and others has shown that vagus nerve innervation is par-ticularly important in modulating hepatic glucose production through central mechanisms 18,26,45 . We investigated whether the acute effect of resveratrol on glucose produc-tion requires the vagus nerve . Before the clamp study , SD male rats received IH cannulae placement immediately fol-lowed by subdiaphragmatic hepatic branch vagotomy or sham surgery . The basal metabolic parameters between the sham and vagotomized groups were significant for a de-crease in the corticosterone level in the vagotomy group Supplementary Table 3 . During the study , the vagotomized or sham-operated animals were treated with vehicle 5 % DMSO or resveratrol 200 mmol L Fig. 4G and H . In the sham-operated animals , resveratrol significantly lowered hepatic glucose production compared with vehicle-treated control RSV 3.61 6 0.85 vs. CTRL 9.50 6 0.33 mg kg min with an overall percent suppression of 50 % Fig. 4I–L . However , in the vagotomized rats there was no significant difference in glucose production between the resveratrol-treated group and vehicle-treated controls RSV 6.71 6 0.71 vs. CTRL 7.3 6 2.15 mg kg min . We then assessed the in vivo glucose flux and found that in the sham-operated ani-mals resveratrol reduced the flux through G6Pase and markedly lowered gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis compared with the vagotomized animals Supplementary Fig. 3A–D . Thus , these findings indicate that vagus nerve innervation is required for mediating the effects of central resveratrol on hepatic glucose metabolism . Resveratrol affects systemic insulin sensitivity by activating central SIRT1 . The previous studies have revealed the effect of hypothalamic resveratrol on glucose metabolism and the importance of central SIRT1 . Recent reports have shown that chronic oral administration of resveratrol increases insulin sensitivity and reduces hyper-glycemia 8–10 . We investigated whether acute systemic infusion of resveratrol could recapitulate the metabolic findings of the chronic resveratrol studies and determined the involvement of central SIRT1 to the actions of systemic resveratrol . To this end , we infused vehicle 5 % DMSO or resveratrol 10 mmol kg systemically while vehicle 5 % DMSO or the SIRT1 inhibitor was infused IH into chroni-cally catheterized SD male rats during pancreatic insulin-clamp studies Fig. 5A . Systemic resveratrol significantly lowered plasma insulin levels , whereas basal glucose levels were unchanged Fig. 5B . During the insulin clamp , the GIR required to maintain euglycemia was more than two times higher in the resveratrol-treated group compared with controls RSV 7.0 6 0.7 vs. CTRL 2.7 6 0.6 mg kg min P , 0.005 . The need to infuse more glucose was mainly due to a reduction in hepatic glucose production in the resveratrol group compared with the vehicle-treated group RSV 5.3 6 0.9 vs. CTRL 9.6 6 0.8 mg kg min P , 0.05 . Overall , the percent suppression of hepatic glucose production was 55 6 5 % with resveratrol treatment compared with 26 6 6 % with control . At the same time , no significant change was noted in peripheral glucose uptake between groups Fig. 5C–F . These results indicate that acute systemic infusion of resveratrol is sufficient to increase insulin sensitivity . More important , after central inhibition of SIRT1 , the effect of systemic resveratrol on glucose production was completely reversed . To determine whether systemic resveratrol regulates hepatic glucose output similar to that observed with cen-tral resveratrol , we determined the flux through G6Pase and the relative contributions of gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis . As in central administration , systemic resveratrol causes a significant decrease in the G6Pase flux that was negated by central infusion of the SIRT1 inhibitor Fig. 5G . As seen before with the hypothalamic studies , systemic resveratrol markedly reduced glycogen-olysis and to a lesser extent gluconeogenesis . With the SIRT1 inhibitor in the hypothalamus , the reduction in glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis seen with systemic resveratrol was abolished Fig. 5H and I . The findings strongly suggest that the effect of systemic resveratrol on modulating glucose homeostasis is highly dependent on the activation of central SIRT1 . DISCUSSION The deacetylase SIRT1 is emerging as a therapeutic target for the management of metabolic disorders . Several reports have demonstrated the role of SIRT1 and its activator res-veratrol in the regulation of glucose metabolism 4,8,9,23 . The studies presented reveal how acute administration of resveratrol directly to the MBH affects hepatic glucose production and insulin action and that MBH-specific in-hibition of SIRT1 is sufficient to ablate these effects . Sec-ond , they also show that the systemic action of resveratrol is mediated via a central SIRT1-dependent pathway . Fur-ther , they reveal that resveratrol is dependent on the activation of the hypothalamic KATP channel for its effects on hepatic glucose production and that transection of the hepatic branch of the vagus nerve significantly attenuated the effect of central resveratrol on glucose production . Together , these findings reveal that resveratrol-induced activation of SIRT1 is important in mediating the regula-tion of glucose homeostasis and that these effects are primarily mediated through vagus nerve input to the liver . Although it has been largely accepted that SIRT1 is a principal target of resveratrol , several reports have raised the question of whether the effects of resveratrol are due to its activation of SIRT1 46 . The studies pre-sented in this report clearly demonstrate that pharmaco-logic or molecular inhibition of SIRT1 is sufficient to abolish the effect of resveratrol on glucose production and insulin action . These results are significant because they explicitly show that SIRT1 is required for the effect of resveratrol in modulating glucose homeostasis . A link be-tween resveratrol action and the activation of AMPK in peripheral tissues has also been purported 8,9,40,47 . Hypothalamic AMPK is a major nutrient sensor , and its activation is critical for maintaining glucose homeostasis and energy balance 48 . Our studies found no evidence of AMPK activation after MBH resveratrol infusion . These results are similar to those reported in a recent study in-dicating that intracerebroventricular resveratrol treatment over several weeks did not alter AMPK activity in mice 23 . Thus , it seems that central AMPK does not have a significant role on the effect of MBH resveratrol on glu-cose homeostasis . Central or systemic administration of resveratrol lowered glucose production by decreasing hepatic glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis . This effect was ablated with SIRT1 in-hibition . It is interesting to note the marked suppression of glycogenolysis compared with gluconeogenesis after acute resveratrol treatment . This finding suggests that resveratrol has a potent inhibitory effect on hepatic glucose fluxes to reduce glucose output . A recent study has shown that se-lective activation of SIRT1 reduces gluconeogenesis in an insulin-resistant rodent model , thereby preventing hy-perglycemia 14 . However , there are other studies indi-cating that activation of SIRT1 enhances gluconeogenesis , whereas decreased expression of liver-specific SIRT1 reduces gluconeogenesis and therefore reduces glucose production 49,50 . It is not immediately clear how to rec-oncile these different outcomes , and further work may be needed to determine whether there is a differential mecha-nism involved . Most of the available evidence , including that presented in this article , suggests that activation of SIRT1 has a significant effect on improving insulin sensitivity and glucose handling . The effect of MBH resveratrol on glucose production raised pertinent questions regarding which hypothalamic neural pathway was being activated and how the message was being conveyed to the liver . Previous studies have shown that the hypothalamic KATP channel is adept at reg-istering metabolic signals from multiple sources , including hormonal and nutrient substrates , and eventually relaying them to the liver . Our studies show that blockade of the KATP channel in the MBH is sufficient to disrupt the action of resveratrol on glucose production . Thus , activation of the KATP channel is necessary for resveratrol action . In the same way , selective hepatic vagotomy significantly reduced the effect of central resveratrol on glucose production , sug-gesting that vagal innervation is required for the regulation of glucose homeostasis by resveratrol . These findings em-phasize the importance of the neural pathway s that link resveratrol action in the brain to the regulation of glucose production in the liver . Most important , these studies are the first to identify a neural mediated pathway to explain how MBH resveratrol affects hepatic glucose homeostasis . In summary , our findings highlight the importance of the arcuate nucleus as a major site of resveratrol action in the regulation of glucose homeostasis . Further , they also pro-vide support for the concept that central SIRT1 is required for resveratrol’s action . Taken together , these studies have emphasized that acute MBH administration of resveratrol has a significant effect on reducing hepatic glucose pro-duction and increasing insulin sensitivity . A thorough un-derstanding of the central effect of resveratrol on glucose production and insulin action may provide a link to further understand how this pharmacologic agent favorably con-veys many of the beneficial metabolic effects of caloric re-striction and reduced energy states . Most important , these studies show that SIRT1 activators have therapeutic po-tential for use in the management of metabolic disorders .

Diabetes 60 2939–2946 , 2011 Smicrovascular keletal muscle microvascular perfusion distribu-tion is determined by precapillary terminal arte-riolar tone . Dilating these arterioles increases perfusion and expands the capil-lary exchange surface area , whereas constriction leads to the opposite 1,2 . Microvascular insulin resistance and dysfunction are closely related with metabolic insulin re-sistance in diabetes 2–4 . Insulin-mediated microvascular recruitment precedes insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in skeletal muscle 5 , and blockade of insulin’s microvas-cular action with Nv-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester L-NAME decreases steady-state insulin-stimulated glucose disposal by ~40 % 5,6 . To act on muscle , insulin must first traverse the micro-vasculature perfusing the muscle and then be transported through the vascular endothelium into muscle interstitium . Recent evidence suggests that altered muscle microvascu-lar perfusion profoundly affects insulin delivery and action in muscle 2 . Many physiological factors regulate muscle microvascular perfusion in vivo , including insulin , mixed meals , and muscle contraction 7–12 . Increased muscle microvascular recruitment induced by muscle contraction is associated with increased muscle insulin uptake 11 . The renin-angiotensin system RAS plays a central role in maintaining hemodynamic stability 13,14 , and angio-tensin ANG II can interact with the insulin-signaling pathways to regulate insulin sensitivity . In cultured cells , ANG II acts via the ANG II type 1 receptor AT1R to impair insulin actions 15–17 . On the other hand , acutely raising ANG II systemically improves insulin-stimulated muscle glucose utilization in humans 18–20 and increases muscle microvascular recruitment independent of blood pressure changes in rodents 21 . Both the AT1R and ANG II type 2 receptor AT2R are present on endothelial cells , vascular smooth-muscle cells , and other vessel-associated cells throughout skeletal muscle microcirculation 13,22,23 . ANG II stimulates cell proliferation and vasoconstriction via the AT1Rs and promotes vasodilation through the AT2R 24,25 . We recently have reported that both the AT1Rs and the AT2Rs significantly regulate basal microvascular tone and glucose use by muscle 21 . Although basal AT2R ac-tivity increases muscle microvascular blood volume MBV an index of microvascular surface area and perfusion and glucose extraction , basal AT1R activity decreases both 21 . In the current study , we assessed whether ANG II receptors modulate muscle insulin delivery and sensitivity in vivo . Our results indicate that both AT1Rs and AT2Rs regulate insulin’s microvascular and metabolic action in muscle . Although AT1R activity restrains muscle metabolic responses to insulin via decreased microvascular re-cruitment and insulin delivery , AT2R activity is required for normal microvascular responses to insulin . RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals , published by the National FIG. 1 . Experimental protocols . RESULTS We have previously demonstrated that basal AT1R and AT2R regulate muscle microvascular volume and glucose use 21 . Because the microvasculature plays an important role in insulin delivery and substrate exchange between the plasma and interstitial compartments , we first exam-ined whether changes in AT1R and AT2R activities altered insulin-mediated glucose disposal . As shown in Fig. 2 , injection of losartan had no effect on insulin-mediated glucose disposal . On the other hand , PD123319 infusion , given either immediately before or 30 min after the initiation of insulin infusion , promptly attenuated insulin-stimulated whole-body glucose disposal , and this effect was main-tained during the entire 120 or 90 min of PD123319 in-fusion P , 0.02 , ANOVA . At steady state , AT2R blockade decreased the whole-body glucose disposal rate by ~30 % P 0.02 for both PD123319 groups . In saline-only rats , the microvascular parameters did not change significantly dur-ing the course of the study . We have shown that basal AT1R tone restricts skeletal muscle MBV , whereas basal AT2R activity increases mus-cle MBV 21 . We next examined whether selective stim-ulation of the ANG II subtype receptors by endogenous ANG II regulate insulin-mediated microvascular recruitment . *P 0.02 ANOVA . Figure 3 shows the microvascular responses to insulin infusion . Insulin infusion raised plasma insulin concen-trations from 99 6 15 pmol L to 685 6 151 pmol L n 5 , P , 0.02 . As expected , insulin increased both MBV and MBF without altering MFV Fig. 3 . The addition of PD123319 to insulin infusion promptly inhibited this insulin-mediated increase in MBV and MBF and significantly increased the MFV Fig. 4 . When PD123319 was given before insulin infusion , insulin-induced increases in mus-cle MBV and MBF were completely prevented . On the other hand , infusion of PD123319 after insulin had already significantly recruited muscle microvasculature i.e. , 30 min after insulin infusion abrogated the insulin effects . These changes did not seem to be secondary to changes in blood pressure or total blood flow because both MAP and FBF remained stable during the study Table 1 . Injection of losartan 5 min prior to the initiation of insulin promptly increased muscle MBV within 30 min , and the extent of the increase 2.4-to 3.2-fold was quite similar to what we previously observed using losartan alone 21 . The increase in MBV lasted for the entire 120 min . Muscle MFV did not change in the first 90 min but decreased at 120 min . As a result , muscle MBF increased promptly at 30 min , remained elevated at 60 min , and trended down afterward Fig. 5 . Though MAP did not change , FBF decreased by nearly 30 % P , 0.01 Table 1 . The rapid attenuation of insulin-stimulated whole-body glucose disposal and muscle microvascular recruitment by PD123319 prompted us to further examine the impact of ANG II receptor stimulation by endogenous ANG II on the insulin effects on the vasculature NO production and muscle Akt phosphorylation . Both insulin and losartan increase micro-vascular recruitment via a NO-dependent pathway 6,21 . As shown in Fig. 6A , 2 h of insulin infusion increased plasma NO levels by nearly twofold P , 0.01 . Concurrent PD123319 infusion decreased insulin-mediated increases in plasma NO levels by 37 % P , 0.04 to levels that were not significantly different from the saline controls . On the other hand , losartan injection had no significant impact on insulin-stimulated NO production . Figure 6B shows insulin-stimulated Akt phosphorylation in the skeletal muscle . Similar to the pattern of plasma NO levels , insulin significantly increased muscle Akt phosphorylation , and this effect was sup-pressed back to the saline control level when PD123319 infusion was superimposed on insulin infusion . Again , losartan had no effect on insulin-stimulated Akt phos-phorylation in muscle . Muscle endothelial NO synthase eNOS phosphorylation did not differ among all four groups Fig. 6C . The above data clearly indicate that AT2R blockade attenuates insulin-mediated muscle microvascular re-cruitment , glucose disposal , and signaling . To this end , we examined whether modulating the ANG II receptor FIG. 3 . Insulin increases skeletal-muscle microvascular recruitment in rats . A Changes in muscle MBV . P 0.03 ANOVA .

Compared with basal level , *P 0.05 and # P 0.01 . stimulation by endogenous ANG II would alter muscle in-sulin delivery and uptake protocol 2 . As shown in Fig. 7 , infusion of PD123319 did not significantly alter 125I-insulin degradation in the plasma Fig. 7A . However , it decreased muscle 125I-insulin content by nearly 50 % P , 0.05 , confirming a decreased muscle insulin uptake in the pres-ence of AT2R blockade . TABLE 1 Changes in MAP and FBF in protocol 1 experiments Data are means 6 SEM . n 5–7 . *Compared with basal 0 min , P , DISCUSSION In humans , ANG II infusion acutely enhances insulin-stimulated muscle glucose disposal 18–20 . This was suggested to be attributable to enhanced tissue perfusion , although evidence for this was not available . We recently have found that both the AT1R and AT2R exert potent basal tonic effects on microvasculature in skeletal muscle 21 . 0.01 . FIG. 5 .

Here , we show that both AT1R and AT2R regulate insulin’s microvascular and metabolic actions in muscle . Although the blockade of AT1R significantly increased muscle mi-crovascular perfusion , it did not further enhance insulin-stimulated whole-body glucose disposal , NO production , and muscle Akt phosphorylation . In contrast , AT2R antag-onism promptly attenuated muscle metabolic responses to insulin , which was associated with decreased muscle in-sulin uptake and insulin-mediated NO production and mi-crovascular recruitment . Although we previously have demonstrated that dual blockade of both AT1R and AT2R had neutral effects on muscle microvascular recruitment and basal glucose extraction , whether dual blockade alters microvascular and muscle insulin sensitivity is unclear . In addition , our observations may represent a combined pe-ripheral and central effect because it is likely that both losartan and PD123319 could exert central effects via either penetrating the blood-brain barrier or acting on the blood vessels in the central nervous system 28 . An al-ternative is to administrate these compounds locally into the microvasculature via the epigastric artery 32 . How-ever , this would require abdominal incision , which further stresses the animals , and prolonged infusions would likely also raise systemic concentrations . Similar to the previous reports 8,12,33–36 , insulin po-tently increased muscle MBV by 58–75 % . Injection of los-artan prior to the initiation of insulin infusion increased muscle MBV by approximately two-to threefold Fig. 5 , FIG. 6 .

C Changes in muscle eNOS phosphorylation . n 4 . P 0.05 ANOVA . For gel images in B and C , they were from different parts of the same gels with same exposure . which is similar to what we observed previously with losartan alone 21 . Thus , there seems to be no additive effects of losartan and insulin on muscle MBV . It is likely that the large increase in MBV achieved with the losartan injection may have masked the insulin effect . The large in-crease in muscle MBV at 30 min without an increase in FBF likely reflects a shift in flow distribution from nonnutritive to nutritive microvascular beds 37 . Of interest , MBF trended down after 90 min , which was likely secondary to the gradual decline in FBF and a decrease in MFV at 120 min . Whether these findings are caused by either losartan alone or losartan plus insulin remain to be clarified because MFV and MBF were not determined in our previous study using losartan alone 21 . Compared with increases induced by insulin alone Fig. 3 , the increases in muscle MBV in-duced by losartan and insulin combination was only sig-nificantly higher at 30 min P , 0.03 , and increases in muscle MBF were not statistically different between the two groups . Thus , it is not surprising that the addition of FIG. 7 . AT2R blockade decreases skeletal muscle 125I-insulin uptake . Five minutes after bolus injection of 125I-insulin 1.5 mCi i.v . , blood and skeletal muscle samples were collected , and intact 125I-insulin was determined after trichloroacetic acid precipitation .

Com-pared with saline , *P 0.05 . losartan to insulin did not further increase muscle insulin action beyond what we saw with insulin alone because insulin-mediated microvascular recruitment is tightly coupled with insulin’s metabolic action . AT2R has been associated with vasodilation in large capacitance vessels , resistance arterioles , as well as the microvasculature 21,23,38–41 , likely via the bradykinin-NO-cGMP signaling cascade because the AT2R antagonist PD123319 , the bradykinin receptor 2 antagonist icatibant , and the NO synthase inhibitor L-NAME each independently blocks this action 25,38,42,43 . We previously have reported that skeletal muscle precapillary arterioles are a major site of AT2R action in vivo because blockade of the AT1R with losartan causes a threefold increase in muscle MBV , whereas blockade of the AT2R renders an ~80 % reduction in muscle MBV 21 . Our current results confirmed that AT2R activity also plays an important role in the regulation of insulin’s microvascular and metabolic responses in muscle as well . Indeed , PD123319 caused a prompt decrease in insulin-mediated glucose disposal , which was associated with abrogation of insulin-stimulated muscle microvascular re-cruitment , NO production and muscle Akt phosphorylation , and muscle insulin uptake . Thus , AT2Rs are important reg-ulators of both basal microvascular tone and insulin delivery action in muscle via its effects on the microvasculature , which is consistent with the current understanding that the regulation of microvascular insulin delivery is a major rate-limiting step in skeletal muscle insulin action 2,44–47 . It is important to distinguish between the acute effects we observed and what might be going on when the RAS already is at a higher level as occurs in obesity and diabetes . Increased muscle microvascular perfusion in-duced by muscle contraction is clearly associated with increased muscle insulin uptake even in the presence of high plasma free fatty acids 10,11 . In humans , simple obesity blunts insulin-and mixed-meal–stimulated muscle microvascular recruitment 9,35 . Likewise , in obese Zucker rats , an animal model of metabolic syndrome and insulin resistance , basal skeletal muscle MBV is decreased , which is coupled with impaired insulin-mediated glucose disposal and microvascular recruitment 48 . Insulin uptake has not been assessed in this model . However , treatment of the Zucker diabetic fatty rats with the ACE inhibitor quinapril restores insulin’s microvascular action and improves insulin-mediated whole-body glucose disposal 49 . Because the cardiovascular RAS is upregulated in diabetes , which has been implicated in the development of diabetic cardio-vascular complications 7,13,24,50 , blockade of the AT1R and or activation of the AT2R may help to improve insulin delivery and sensitivity and potentially improve the car-diovascular outcomes in patients with diabetes . Although the current study revealed important modulatory roles of ANG II subreceptors on insulin action under normal phys-iology , whether the current findings can be extrapolated to the insulin-resistant state is unclear and requires additional studies . We previously have shown in humans that physiologic hyperinsulinemia increases muscle MBF solely by in-creasing MBV without changing the MFV 8,35,36 . Our current study in rodents confirmed this lack of change in MFV after insulin stimulation as well Figs. 3 and 4 . Al-though the addition of losartan to the insulin infusion caused a decrease in MFV at 120 min , superimposing the PD123319 infusion not only promptly attenuated insulin-stimulated MBV but it also increased muscle MFV . Be-cause there was no change in total FBF , this increase in MFV was likely secondary to the acute decrease in MBV . Our finding that insulin increased plasma NO levels is consistent with many previous reports demonstrating that insulin causes vasodilation via the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase Akt eNOS pathway 2,4–6,51 . We previously have demonstrated that losartan treatment led to microvascular recruitment via the AT2R-NO–dependent mechanism be-cause L-NAME treatment abolished losartan-induced in-creases in MBV and glucose extraction 21 . The increase in plasma NO levels seen with combined losartan and insulin treatment most likely reflects increased release of NO from the endothelium secondary to endogenous ANG II stimula-tion of the AT2R B2R eNOS pathway and insulin stimulation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase Akt eNOS pathway . The NO release is less likely from skeletal muscle cells , because they express predominantly AT1R 52 , which activates NADPH oxidase , increases reactive oxygen species , and results in decreased NO bioavailability . In the current study , NO production did not further increase with the combined losartan and insulin treatment , which is consistent with the findings that the increases in MBV and MBF were not sta-tistically different between the two groups . According to the Fick principle , increases in the endo-thelial exchange surface area between the plasma and the interstitial compartments in muscle could significantly in-crease the delivery of insulin to the muscle microvascu-lature and facilitate its transfer to the interstitial space and enhance its metabolic action . Our observation that insulin-stimulated glucose disposal and muscle Akt phosphory-lation , two major indices of insulin metabolic actions in muscle , closely parallel the changes in insulin-mediated microvascular recruitment and NO production , and muscle insulin uptake strongly supports this concept . Indeed , PD123319 superimposing on insulin infusion decreased all these major end points in the current study . The abroga-tion of insulin-induced microvascular recruitment with PD123319 infusion most likely resulted in a decreased in-sulin delivery and uptake in the muscle because it is in the microvasculature where insulin uptake takes place and decreased exchange surface area could significantly de-crease muscle insulin uptake . The decreases in NO pro-duction and Akt phosphorylation with PD123319 infusion are likely secondary to decreased stimulation of the AT2R by ANG II and insulin receptor by insulin on the endo-thelium for NO and decreased insulin delivery to the muscle for p-Akt . In conclusion , both AT1Rs and AT2Rs regulate insulin’s microvascular and metabolic actions in muscle . Our cur-rent findings strongly suggest that ANG receptors affect insulin sensitivity in vivo via modulating microvascular perfusion . This is an important finding because changes in the microvascular endothelial surface area significantly affects insulin delivery to and action in muscle 2 . Addi-tional studies are needed to define the underlying mole-cular mechanisms . Although AT1R activity restrains muscle metabolic responses to insulin via decreased muscle mi-crovascular recruitment and insulin delivery , AT2R activity is required for normal muscle microvascular and metabolic responses to insulin . Thus , pharmacologic manipulation aimed at increasing the AT2R-to-AT1R activity ratio may af-ford potential to improve muscle insulin sensitivity and glucose metabolism and to reduce the cardiovascular com-plications associated with diabetes and insulin resistance .

21896932	RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS—We phenotypically Diabetes 60 2903–2913 , 2011 Tmonly ype 1 diabetes is a chronic autoimmune disease caused by the selective destruction of pancreatic insulin-producing b-cells 1 . Autoimmunity com-occurs when central and or peripheral tolerance barriers are broken down , allowing the activa-tion of self-reactive T cells 2 , which are clearly pivotal for type 1 diabetes development 3 . Animal models of diabetes , such as NOD mice , have indicated that Th1 cells that se-crete interferon-g INF-g are key in the destruction of b-cells as activators of CD8+ T cells 4 . More recently , Th17 immunity has also been implicated in type 1 diabetes , as supported by the observation that interleukin-17 IL-17 is expressed in the pancreas of NOD mice , and that in-hibition of IL-17 leads to delayed diabetes onset 5,6 . In humans , Th17 cells are defined as CD4+ T cells that pro-duce IL-17 and are characterized by the expression of a unique pattern of surface receptors , including CCR4 , CCR6 , and CD161 7 . Th17 immunity is increased in the blood of patients with type 1 diabetes compared with healthy sub-jects 8,9 , but how these findings are relevant to the organ targeted by autoimmune diabetes is still unknown . Self-reactive T cells in healthy individuals are controlled by peripheral tolerance mechanisms , in which natural T regulatory cells Tregs have emerged as primary media-tors 10,11 . Natural Tregs are characterized by the high expression of the IL-2Ra chain CD25 and the transcrip-tion factor forkhead box P3 FOXP3 12 . Importantly , CD25 and FOXP3 are also upregulated in human activated non-Tregs , and their expression can easily be altered by inflammation and or drug administration 13 . We found that natural Tregs differ from other T-cell populations in their DNA methylation status of a defined region within the FOXP3 locus , termed the Treg-specific demethylated region TSDR demethylation of this region is observed exclusively in natural Tregs , but not in activated FOXP3+ non-Tregs or in TGF-b–induced Tregs 14–16 . The TSDR is currently considered a reliable marker for bona fide Tregs 17 . However , it is still uncertain whether T cells com-pletely demethylated at the FOXP3 locus automatically possess a functional regulatory activity . Recent studies have shown that Tregs in the pancreas of diabetic NOD mice express low levels of CD25 owing to diminished levels of IL-2 , which is a critical factor for Treg cell growth 18 . These tissue-infiltrating Tregs are prone to apoptosis and thus fail to control autoimmune responses that lead to diabetes 18 . In addition , lymphopenic and inflammatory environments can both lead to loss of FOXP3 expression in murine Tregs 19–21 . In humans , the data are less comprehensive , and to our knowledge , all of the studies performed so far on Tregs in type 1 diabetes have been conducted on peripheral blood PB . They demon-strate that the frequency of peripheral Tregs is not altered but that they may have an increased sensitivity to apo-ptosis 22 . Their in vitro suppressive function is slightly reduced in some experimental settings 23–26 , but not in others 27,28 . In addition , recent data suggest that effector T cells in patients with diabetes are refractory to inhibition by Tregs 29,30 and that aberrant IL-2 signaling in CD4+ T cells contributes to reduced FOXP3 expression 31 . Over-all , these data corroborate the idea that a defect in Tregs in diabetes may contribute to the loss of self-tolerance , but we do not yet have solid evidence to support this hypothesis . Self-reactive T cells and Tregs in patients should pref-erably be considered and assessed in the context of the organ targeted by the autoimmune process rather than in the circulation . We initiated the current study to investi-gate effector T cells and Tregs in the pancreatic-draining lymph nodes PLNs of patients affected by type 1 diabetes compared with those circulating in their PB . RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Analysis of the methylation status of the FOXP3 TSDR . The assay was TABLE 1 Characteristics of type 1 diabetic patients and nondiabetic donors RESULTS Th17 cells are expanded in the PLNs of type 1 diabetic patients . PLNs were obtained from 19 subjects with long-term type 1 diabetes and from 63 nondiabetic brain-dead multiorgan donors . PB was also collected from 14 type 1 dia-betic patients who each donated a PLN , from 4 type 1 diabetic subjects who did not donate the PLN , and from 11 healthy control subjects . Donor characteristics are summarized in Table 1 , and detailed information on each diabetic patient is given in Supplementary Table 1 . The percentages of total CD3+ T cells and of CD3+CD4+ T cells were similar in diabetic patients and nondiabetic donors in the PLNs and PB Fig. 1A . Conversely , the frequency of CD3+CD8+ T cells was higher in the PLNs of diabetic patients Fig. 1A , and this led to a lower CD4 CD8 T-cell ratio in diabetic donors compared with non-diabetic subjects Supplementary Table 2 . The antigen-experienced T cells , defined by the expression of CD45RO , were enriched within the lymph node and circulating CD4+ T cells , but not within the CD8+ T cells , of diabetic subjects Fig. 1B . The expansion of CD4+CD45RO+ T cells observed in diabetic patients was independent of donor age data not shown . To determine the frequency of the various T-helper cell subsets within the antigen-experienced CD4+ T cells , we tested the frequency of Th1 and Th17 cells by the expres-sion of specific chemokine-receptors by CD4+CD45RO+ T cells i.e. , CCR5+CCR6+ and CCR4+CCR6+CD161+ , respectively 34,35 Supplementary Fig. 3 , and by cytokine-release i.e. , IFN-g and IL-17 , respectively upon polyclonal activation of CD4+ T cells . Th1 cells were ex-panded only in the PLNs of diabetic donors , as determined by chemokine-receptor expression but not by IFN-g re-lease . However , Th1 cells in the PB of diabetic patients were slightly increased compared with those of healthy control subjects , as determined by IFN-g production but not by chemokine receptor expression Fig. 1C . Th2 cells were equally present in all tissues and donors analyzed data not shown . Th17 cells were significantly expanded only in the PLNs of diabetic patients Fig. 1D . In addition , IL-17 was produced by the PLNs of diabetic donors upon diabetes-related antigen-specific activation i.e. , proinsulin and GAD65 , whereas the same IL-17 was never released by the PLNs of nondiabetic subjects . IFN-g was secreted at similar levels upon diabetes-related antigen-specific acti-vation of the PLNs isolated from diabetic and nondiabetic individuals Fig. 1E . The results obtained with the few PLNs of diabetic patients that we could test have thus far eluded attempts to establish any correlation between anti-GAD65 autoAb reported in the Supplementary Table 1 and in vitro reactivity to GAD65 . These data show that Th17 immunity is enhanced in the PLNs isolated from long-term diabetic patients but not in their PB . FOXP3-expressing CD4+ T cells are reduced , whereas epigenetically imprinted Tregs are similar in the PLNs of diabetic patients compared with those of nondiabetic donors . The frequency of Tregs was first determined by flow cytometry through analysis of CD25bright within the CD45+ cells , of FOXP3+CD1272 within the CD25bright T cells , and of CD25bright FOXP3+CD1272 within the CD45+ cells . All three analyses revealed a signif-icant Treg reduction only in the PLNs of patients with type 1 diabetes and not , as already largely demonstrated by us and others 23,24,26–28 , in their PB Fig. 2A . The amount of FOXP3 assessed by median fluorescence intensity MFI expressed in CD4+ T cells and in CD25bright T cells was similar within the PLNs of diabetic and nondiabetic donors Supplementary Table 3 . Because CD25 and FOXP3 are markers that can be altered by the environment 13 , we performed the Treg-specific demethylated region TSDR assay on the total cells isolated from the PLNs and PB . Unlike the phenotype analysis , this readout identifies epi-genetically imprinted Tregs 14–16 and demonstrated that the Treg frequency was similar among diabetic and non-diabetic donors , both in the PLNs and PB Fig. 2B . Thus , the frequency of T cells epigenetically marked to be Tregs is similar in the PLNs and PB of diabetic and nondiabetic individuals , whereas the frequency of T cells that express the FOXP3 protein is reduced only in the target organ of diabetic patients . The TSDR is an exclusive marker for thymic-derived FOXP3+ Tregs , and pervious work has demonstrated that it correlates well with flow cytometry data in determin-ing the Treg frequency in the PB of healthy donors 16 . We confirmed the presence of this correlation in the PB of diabetic patients and healthy control subjects . Unex-pectedly , the Treg frequency in the PLNs of diabetic and nondiabetic donors , as detected by TSDR , was higher than that detected by fluorescence-activated cell sorter FACS Fig. 2C . Thus , some of the cells epigenetically imprinted to be FOXP3+ Tregs lose their FOXP3 expression within the PLN , independently of the disease presence . Tregs isolated from type 1 diabetic patients lose their suppressive ability once they reside in the PLN . The most efficient way to isolate viable and pure human Tregs devoid of contaminating effector T cells remains the flow cytometry–based cell sorting . Thus , functional experiments were performed in this study by using FACS to isolate Tregs , and this led to a highly purified population of Tregs Supplementary Fig. 2 . The limited CD25bright T cells that could be sorted from PLNs of diabetic subjects forced us to perform the in vitro functional assay with a low number of Tregs i.e. , 7,000 cells in the presence of responder PLN cells that were three times higher . At this Treg responder cell ratio , the CD25bright T cells isolated from nondiabetic subjects had an average suppressive function of 30 % , which is consistent with published data 36,37 . In addition , the same cells had an average suppressive activity of 80 % when the assay was performed at the commonly used 1 1 ratio , confirming the solidity of our assay Fig. 3A . CD25bright T cells isolated from PLNs of three diabetic patients did not inhibit proliferation of polyclonally activated autologous PLN T cells , but rather , they had a helper function because their presence in the culture led to increased proliferation of the responder T cells . The CD25bright T cells purified from the PLNs of a further three diabetic patients had a reduced suppressive activity that fell into the low range of those isolated from nondiabetic donors Fig. 3A . The sta-tistical analysis performed on all the samples tested showed that Tregs isolated from the PLNs of diabetic patients have an impaired suppressive capability compared with those of nondiabetic donors P 0.0066 . This different behavior of the CD25bright T cells isolated from PLNs of diabetic and nondiabetic individuals was not due to different levels of T-cell proliferation Fig. 3B or proinflammatory cytokine i.e. , TNF-a production Sup-plementary Fig. 4 by the responder PLN cells between the two groups . In addition , responder PLN T cells of patients with type 1 diabetes were not refractory to CD25bright T-cell–mediated suppression because their pro-liferation was well inhibited by CD25bright T cells isolated from allogeneic PLNs of nondiabetic donors Fig. 3C . There was also no defect in the frequency of IL-2–producing PLN T cells among diabetic patients after 5 h of in vitro stimulation , but rather , it appeared to be higher in diabetic compared with nondiabetic donors Supplementary Fig. 5 . Thus , an IL-2–dependent Treg defect in the PLNs of diabetic subjects is unlikely to be present , although a specific IL-2– signaling deficiency 31 can not at this moment be ruled out . To determine whether the Treg-defective suppressive activity observed in the PLNs of type 1 diabetic patients was lineage-or tissue-specific , Tregs were isolated from the PB of some of the above-tested diabetic patients , and their ability to suppress proliferation of autologous PLN T cells was investigated . Peripheral Tregs , contrary to their PLN counterpart , exerted a suppressive function as effi-cient as that of peripheral Tregs isolated from allogeneic healthy control subjects Fig. 3D . These data did not reach a statistically significant difference , probably be-cause of the limited number of samples that we could test . However , the data all show the same trend Tregs purified from three patients with long-lasting diabetes retain a suppressive function when circulating in the periphery but lose their regulatory activity once they reside within the site of autoinflammatory drainage . We then tested the ability of the CD25bright T cells to inhibit diabetes-related antigen-specific T-cell proliferation , maintaining the physiologic CD25bright responder cell ratio present within the PLN , which was estimated to be 1 50 . To accomplish this , we compared the frequency of T cells proliferating in response to proinsulin within the lymph nodes depleted of CD25bright T cells by flow cytometry as shown in Supplementary Fig. 2 with that within the total PLN . The CD25bright T cells present in the PLNs of diabetic patients did not inhibit proinsulin-specific T-cell pro-liferation but , rather , had a helper activity . By contrast , CD25bright T cells present in the PLNs of nondiabetic sub-jects exerted an average suppressive function of 38 % in response to proinsulin in inhibition of T-cell proliferation and IFN-g production , and this is in line with the low Treg responder cell ratio Fig. 4A . Moreover , we found that CD25bright T cells from PLNs of patients with diabetes did not inhibit proinsulin-specific IFN-g production , contrary to those isolated from nondiabetic subjects . Removal of CD25bright T cells from PLNs of patients with diabetes led to a dramatic fall in IFN-g release Fig. 4B . Thus , de-pletion of Tregs in the PLNs of diabetic patients leads to a reduced proinsulin-specific cell response rather than to an increased one as observed in the PLNs of nondiabetic donors . These data further strengthen those shown in the polyclonal suppressive assays and demonstrate that Tregs isolated from the PLNs of diabetic donors have a defective suppressive activity and also acquire a helper phenotype . Our data seem to suggest that total PLNs of nondiabetic donors respond better to proinsulin in vitro than those of type 1 diabetic donors . However , the PLNs of the three type 1 diabetic donors tested responded to proinsulin at levels similar to those of the “low-range” nondiabetic donors in cell proliferation and IFN-g production . Thus far , we can not conclude that the PLNs of nondiabetic donors respond better to proinsulin than those of diabetic patients because of the low number of patients tested . CD25bright T cells isolated from PLNs of diabetic patients are not contaminated by effector T cells . Overall , the just-mentioned functional assays posed the question of whether the CD25bright T cells isolated from PLNs of diabetic patients were contaminated by activated cytokine-producing effector T cells . We exclude such a pos-sibility because the CD25bright T cells sorted from PLNs of diabetic and nondiabetic donors contained the same amount of FOXP3 mRNA Fig. 5A and expressed the same low transcript levels of the master regulators of Th1 T-box expressed in T cells [ T-bet ] , Th2 GATA-binding protein 3 [ GATA3 ] , and Th17 cells retinoic acid–related orphan re-ceptor C [ RORC ] and of IL-2 and IFN-g Fig. 5B . Most importantly , the sorted CD25bright T cells were all demethy-lated at the FOXP3 locus , proving their epigenetic Treg im-printing Fig. 5C . These data demonstrate that the sorted CD25bright T cells within the PLNs of diabetic patients do not contain effector T cells , and despite being epigenetically determined to be Tregs , they do not exert consistent in vitro regulatory function . Altered tissue-specific immune status in diabetic patients . The Treg Th17 cell balance could be key in controlling autoimmune diseases , type 1 diabetes included 38,39 . Our data show that the PLNs of diabetic patients are enriched in Th17 cells while having similar numbers of bona fide epigenetically imprinted Tregs . To determine whether there is a compensatory mechanism by which Tregs expand in those patients in which Th17 cells are more frequent , we measured the Treg Th17 cell ratio as determined by TSRD analysis and chemokine receptor expression , re-spectively . The Treg Th17 cell ratio was about four to five times lower in the PLNs of diabetic patients compared with nondiabetic donors , but was not different in the PB . Such an inverse correlation was not found between Tregs and Th1 cells Fig. 6A . Thus , the immune balance is shifted toward a Th17-proinflammatory environment only in the target organ of long-lasting diabetic patients and not in their PB . We then tested whether the presence of IL-17–producing CD4+ T cells in vivo within the PLN correlates with the suppressive capacity of the sorted CD25bright T cells . Lin-ear regression analysis revealed that a higher frequency of IL-17–producing CD4+ T cells residing in the PLN was correlated with a lower absent Treg suppressive function R2 0.40 P 0.01 Fig. 6B . These data are suggestive of an inverse correlation between Th17 immunity and the Treg-mediated regulatory activity in the target organ of long-term diabetic individuals . DISCUSSION To what extent proinflammatory Th17 cells and defects in Treg-mediated regulation contribute to the development of type 1 diabetes in humans is highly debated . Here we show that the PLNs of patients with type 1 diabetes , unlike their PB , have an altered immune status due to the expansion of Th17 cells and the presence of CD25bright T cells epige-netically imprinted to have a regulatory activity but which lack a proper function . Increased Th17 cells in the PB of children with diabetes has been recently reported 8 , and Tan and colleagues 9 have demonstrated that these circulating IL-17–producing T cells may reside mainly within the CD4+CD45RA2CD25intFOXP3low cells . Although expressing FOXP3 , this latter cell subset does not have suppressive activity , but rather , it has a helper function and contains proinflammatory cytokine-producing cells 40,41 . Our data demonstrate that the expansion of Th17 immunity is also present in the target organ of patients with long-term diabetes . However , this was not due to a higher number of CD4+CD45RA2C-D25intFOXP3low T cells , which were as frequent as those in nondiabetic donors Supplementary Fig. 6 . Contrary to what has been published 8,9 , we did not find signs of excessive Th17 immunity in the circulating CD4+ T cells of type 1 diabetic patients , and this may be because the individuals in our patient population had the disease for an average of 26 years . One could speculate that Th17 cells circulate early after disease manifestation but tend to accumulate in the target organ once the disease is established . The TSDR is an exclusive marker for thymic-derived FOXP3+ Tregs , and previous work has demonstrated that it correlates well with flow cytometry data in determining the Treg frequency in the PB of healthy donors 16 . We confirmed the presence of such a correlation in the PB of healthy control subjects and diabetic patients . Unexpect-edly , the Treg frequency in the PLNs of both diabetic and nondiabetic donors , as detected by TSDR , was higher than that detected by FACS . Thus , some of the cells epigenetically imprinted to be FOXP3+ Tregs lose their FOXP3 expres-sion within the PLN , and these new findings are currently under investigation . Another unexpected finding of our study was that CD25bright T cells completely demethylated at the FOXP3 locus have an impaired regulatory activity only in the PLNs of patients with type 1 diabetes . The crucial question is why cells that are epigenetically imprinted to be regulatory do not function as such , and why this occurs only in di-abetic patients and , specifically , in their PLNs . Firstly , post-transcriptional modification of the gene expressing FOXP3 may occur , leading to reduced or unstable FOXP3 expression . Secondly , there may be a FOXP3-stabilizing factor that is reduced in the PLN Tregs . Alternatively , other molecules fundamental for Treg function and sig-nature may be defective within the PLN CD25bright T cells of diabetic patients . Unfortunately , the limited number of cells obtained from our samples was an obstacle to such an extensive analysis . Finally , important environmental factors , such as cytokines and or chemokines , may also prevent the Tregs from being functionally fit only in di-abetic subjects . We have shown that the key features of the PLN of di-abetic subjects are 1 an unbalanced Treg Th17 cell ratio 2 increased IL-17–producing CD4+ T cells in response to diabetes-related antigens and 3 the presence of CD25bright T cells epigenetically imprinted to be Tregs but which overall are reduced in FOXP3 expression and have a de-fective suppressive activity . We know that 1 IL-17 has an apoptotic activity on human pancreatic b-cells 8 and 2 pathogenic Th17 responses in mice are restrained by Tregs via FOXP3 binding to the phosphorylated form of the sig-nal transducers and activators of transcription 3 STAT3 42,43 . Thus , one could speculate that certain Tregs in diabetic patients , for still unknown reasons , turn off FOXP3 expression once they migrate to the pancreas , leading to defective control of Th17 cells , which expand and cause the destruction of the pancreas by releasing IL-17 . We recognize that the current study has some limi-tations . First , the type 1 diabetic patients had an average disease duration of 26 years . However , we believe that this does not reduce the significance of our results because it was previously found that PLNs of long-term type 1 diabetic subjects , and not of type 2 diabetic patients or nondiabetic donors , harbor insulin-specific T cells 44 , demonstrating the presence of effector T cells in the target organ of type 1 diabetic individuals years after onset . A recent study showed that insulin-producing b-cells are still present in patients who have had diabetes for more than 50 years 45 , and these cells can represent an important antigen-reservoir , drawing inflammatory cells to the pancreas and PLNs even years after disease onset . For instance , the di-abetic patient T1D024 included in our study symbol ? had preserved fasting C-peptide levels 9 years after disease onset , and he was one of those donors whose PLN showed IL-17 production upon GAD65 stimulation and displayed a very limited suppressive ability in polyclonal assays . In addition , studies performed in autoimmune murine models suggest that Tregs are still actively and continuously in-volved in inflammatory regulation after disease develop-ment 46,47 . Second , the age and sex of the various groups of donors were not strictly comparable . Certain recognized i.e. , di-alysis for diabetic patients and period in intensive care or cause of death for nondiabetic donors and nonrecognized characteristics of the donors might also have influenced our results . However , the age and sex of the donors , and their clinical characteristics , had no influence on the Th17-cell and TSDR data data not shown . In addition , we recently collected PLNs from three living nondiabetic donors who underwent pancreas surgery for chronic pancreatitis or pancreatic pseudocysts . Phenotypical and functional data on Tregs isolated from these PLNs were identical to those generated with PLNs of brain-dead nondiabetic donors , further supporting the fact that our results were not affected by external confounding factors data not shown . We therefore believe that , given the uniqueness of the patient samples in our hands , this study is informative and provides original data . Our work puts forward the hypothesis that type 1 di-abetic patients have an altered immune balance in their target organ caused by the presence of excessive Th17 immunity and unfit Tregs . It is still unknown whether these findings are related and whether they are a cause or a consequence of the autoimmune disease . However , our data point to the fact that treatments targeted at suppressing Th17 cells and or refitting Tregs in the target organ may represent a solution for diabetic patients .

21907013	Sequences of HLA-C were obtained from the survey of 9 consisted of about 4.5 kb covering HLA-C coding and flanking regions . Unless otherwise noted , phylogenetic reconstructions used here are based on these extended-length sequences . BLAST was used for searching DNA data-bases10 and facilitating the exhaustive collection of homologous regions of HLA-C as well as great ape MHC-C and from HLA-B and great ape MHC-B . ClustalX11 was used for aligning the sequences . The BLAST-derived sequences are identified initially by accession codes and sequence descriptors . For descriptors that do not contain allelic identification , comparison with the IMGT HLA database was used to identify and label sequences with ap-propriate HLA nomenclature . A sliding window window length 100 bp step size 25 bp was used to calculate p across the entire alignment for each gene . The phy-logeny of the sequences was reconstructed with MEGA 5.0 package12 and either neighbor-joining NJ , maximum parsimony MP , or maximum likelihood ML methods . For the NJ reconstruction , distances were estimated via Ki-mura’s two-parameter method . A linearized ML tree of sequences based on a Tamura-Nei model generated by MEGA was used to date events following elimination of a1 , a2 , and a short divergent segment of the 30UTR described below , which we refer to as the RHD for region of high diversity . HLA genotyping data from 30 diverse populations were generated previously.13 Worldwide HLA-C allele frequen-cies were also obtained from the International Histocom-patibility Working Group IHWG anthropology section of the dbMHC database at NCBI.14 The Weblogo pro-gram15 was used to generate logograms of HLA-C polymor-phic residues . Several studies5,7,16 have identified genetic variants near , but outside of , the coding region of HLA-C that are mark-edly associated with outcomes to HIV infection . A se-quencing survey9 indicates that a noncoding region at the 30 end of the HLA-C alignment shows evidence of striking diversity among HLA-C alleles Figure 1 . In the short RHD segment of about 150 bp , which spans roughly 230–380 bp downstream of the stop codon , the nucleotide diversity in a collection of 45 distinct HLA-C alleles repre-senting 13 distinct lineages reaches 0.08 substitutions per site . This is the highest level of diversity observed in the survey across 4.5 kb of aligned sequence spanning 982 bp 50 to 688 bp 30 of HLA-C . Given that full-length HLA-C alleles have a 30 UTR of about 420 bp , this region of high diversity lies well within the 30 UTR . This localized high diversity is not seen in the homologous 30 UTR in a roughly comparable collection of HLA-B alleles where diversity reaches 0.01 . Closer examination reveals that the HLA-C alleles fall into two groups across the RHD in the 30 UTR . HLA-C alleles are classified into 14 distinct lineages represented by the initial two digits of the name . Alleles belonging to the C*02 , C*05 , C*06 , C*08 , C*12 , C*15 and C*16 line - ages are nearly identical throughout the RHD from posi-tions 230–380 and differ in at least ten positions from alleles of the C*01 , C*03 , C*04 , C*07 , C*14 and C*17 line - ages . The former group of alleles is characterized by the deletion of position 263 in the 30 UTR 263del and neigh-boring substitutions that prevent miR-148a recognition , and we refer to these as ‘‘escape alleles.’’ The latter contain an intact miR-148a binding site and are therefore termed ‘‘inhibited’’ alleles . Some alleles of the inhibited group differ slightly from each other within the 30 UTR RHD , but this accounts for very little of the overall diversity in this region and has no effect on miR-148a regulation.8 The primary cause of the high 30 UTR diversity seen in Figure 1 is the differentiation of the HLA-C alleles into the two distinctive groups . In order to determine whether the HLA-C escape and in-hibited allelic groups remain distinct outside of the RHD , we made phylogenetic reconstructions for available com-plete HLA-C sequences covering about 4.5 kb.9 In addition to this HLA-C sequence data , we ran BLAST searches to find homologous full-length HLA-B17 and great ape MHC-B and MHC-C sequences for use in our alignment and phyloge-netic analyses . To avoid effects of the RHD on our recon-struction , we removed this segment from the analysis . The tree of MHC-B and MHC-C sequences Figure 2 indi-cates that both genes form separate clusters , where the escape and inhibited HLA-C groups cluster together and are distinct 100 % bootstrap support from HLA-B and great ape MHC-B sequences . Chimpanzee Patr-C and gorilla Gogo-C MHC-C alleles , all of which contain the miR-148a binding site , group with the inhibited and escape HLA-C alleles , separate from HLA-B Figure 2 . The MHC-C*07 lineage shows evidence for trans-specific polymor-phism between human and chimpanzee , indicating that it is sufficiently old to be shared with the nonhuman primate species . On the other hand , the HLA-C alleles of the escape group appear to be human specific . Further-more , the escape alleles form a well-supported monophy-letic cluster 97 % bootstrap support in this analysis that excludes the RHD . The monophyletic clustering of escape alleles indicates that the marked divergence seen in the RHD of extant HLA-C alleles Figure 1 might be explained by an event that occurred in the common ancestor of the escape group . Although sequence information for the RHD region of the 30 UTR of the HLA-C*18 lineage is unavailable , all HLA-C*18 alleles group closely to HLA-C* 04 alleles in phylogenetic analysis of the coding region bootstrap support 74 % , tree not shown , and we consider it likely that like the C*04 lineage , it belongs to the miR-148a in-hibited group . Next , we considered the relationship of the HLA-C RHD to the homologous regions of genes closely related to HLA-C . Initial analyses indicated a substantially higher similarity of the RHD of escape alleles to the homologous region of HLA-B , rather than HLA-A MIM 142800 , HLA-G MIM 142871 or HLA-H MIM 235200 the ho-mologous region appears absent in HLA-E [ MIM 143010 ] and HLA-F [ MIM 143110 ] data not shown . We used BLAST to iden-tify 50 HLA-B sequence submissions con-taining data for the region homologous to the RHD and covering 24 of the 36 known HLA-B lineages . Alignment of the RHD region of the 30 UTR of HLA-C and HLA-B alleles Figure 3 reveals that alleles of the escape group are strikingly similar to the HLA-B alleles in precisely those sites that differentiate escape from inhibited HLA-C alleles . Of the ten variant positions that differentiate escape from inhibited groups in the 152 bp 30 UTR RHD positions 259 , 261 , 263 , 266 , 294 , 299 , 300 , 307 , 335 , and 336 , up to nine are shared by the escape alleles and certain HLA-B alleles , and at least eight are shared by all escape and HLA-B alleles surveyed . Whereas the HLA-C escape and inhibited alleles differ markedly in this region , alleles representing seven of the 24 HLA-B lineages in our survey the HLA-B*07 , HLA-B* 08 , HLA-B*40 , HLA-B*41 , HLA-B*48 , HLA-B*50 , and HLA-B*58 lineages appear quite similar to alleles of the HLA-C escape group , differing only by a T C substitution at position 266 and exclusively sharing a C T substitution at position 261 with HLA-C escape alleles . When consid-ered across the entire HLA-B sequence , some of these seven HLA-B lineages are relatively distinct and fall into four separate clades in phylogenetic reconstruction data not shown . However , toward the 30 end of the gene , the sepa-rate clades come together , sharing sequence features with the clade containing HLA-B*07 and HLA-B*08 . We refer to these seven lineages as HLA-B*07-like lineages . All other HLA-B alleles that we examined also show high similarity to the HLA-C escape alleles , including the deletion at posi-tion 263 within the miR-148a seed region . On the other hand , the inhibited HLA-C alleles are quite distinctive in the 30 UTR and appear to have no similar counterparts among the HLA-B alleles for which sequence is available . Phylogenetic analysis of HLA-B and HLA-C alleles using only the 152 bp RHD in the 30 UTR strengthens this view . There is strong 99 % bootstrap support for the grouping of escape alleles in a clade containing all HLA-B alleles but excluding inhibited HLA-C alleles Figure 4 . The dendrogram also indicates that the closest relatives of HLA-C escape alleles in this region are the seven pre-viously identified HLA-B*07-like lineages , although the bootstrap support 52 % is not significant . The presence of chimpanzee and gorilla MHC-C alleles in the clade con-taining the inhibited HLA-C alleles indicates that the ancestral condition is probably represented by inhibited alleles and that the substitutions that enable escape occurred later . A parsimonious explanation both for the resemblance of the HLA-C escape to HLA-B alleles in the RHD region and for the monophyly of escape alleles outside of the RDH region is the occurrence of a single conversion event in the common ancestor of the HLA-C escape alleles , with the donor being a sequence related to the HLA-B*07-like group . Given that the B*07 allele is in strong linkage disequilibrium with the C*07 allele , which is not converted and remains miR-148a inhibited , the conversion event probably occurred between chromo-somal homologs rather than between chromatid pairs . The boundaries of the conversion event can not be pre-cisely determined because many residues in the 30 UTR are shared by HLA-C and HLA-B . However , by observing where substitution sharing between HLA-B and HLA-C escape alleles begins and ends , limits to the conversion event can be set . The 50 limits of the exchange occur between position 230 , where a deletion distinguishes HLA-C alleles both escape and inhibited from HLA-B alleles where a G is found and position 259 , where HLA-C escape and HLA-B alleles share a T while a C is found in inhibited HLA-C alleles . Likewise , the 30 limits of the event occur between position 346 , where an A is shared by HLA-B and HLA-C escape alleles but a G is found in in-hibited HLA-C alleles and position 383 , where a T is found in all HLA-B alleles and a G in all examined HLA-C alleles . These limits set a maximum size of the conversion event at 152 bp and a minimum size at 88 bp . To determine the time of occurrence of the conversion event , we generated a linearized ML tree of the MHC-C alleles Figure 5 . We eliminated sites likely to distort our date estimates the a1 , a2 , and RHD regions . Taking the divergence of human and chimpanzee at 6 MYA19 and assuming that the most closely related pair of chimpanzee and human alleles approximate the speciation time see20 for the rationale in estimating MHC divergence times , we estimate that the conversion event occurred about 3–5 MYA . This supports the notion that the event is specific to the human lineage . Examination of available non-human MHC-C alleles agrees with this interpretation because no nonhuman sequences resembling escape alleles in their 30 UTR region have yet been found . The conversion event that generated the escape alleles presumably occurred within a single allele , which diversi-fied into the seven lineages of HLA-C escape alleles found today . We used the IHWG anthropology data in dbMHC to examine worldwide frequencies of HLA-C alleles on 14863 chromosomes typed in various populations . In this large survey , 81 different alleles occur , representing all 14 major lineages classified into 58 distinct sublineages . The frequency of escape alleles in worldwide populations is high , constituting an estimated 32.8 % of HLA-C alleles worldwide . We further examined the frequency of escape alleles by using the survey of HLA-C allele frequencies13 from 30 diverse populations . Escape alleles were common 20 % frequency in large population groups Figure 6 . No population showed extremely high 70 % escape allele frequency , but a few isolated populations show lower frequencies of escape alleles . Among the 30 populations typed , only the Surui , Maya , and Micronesians have escape allele frequencies of less than 10 % , but it is likely in these cases that low frequencies reflect drift or founder effects , because these populations show high homozygosity and low allelic diversity for HLA-C . Many polymorphisms and many of the functional motifs of HLA-C alleles occur in both escape and inhibited lineages . For example , the KIR ligand C1 C2 dichotomy is defined by the amino acid residues at positions 77 and 80 of the mature HLA-C protein18 S77 with N80 defines C1 , and N77 with K80 defines C2 , and both C1 and C2 forms are found within the group of escape alleles , as well as in the group of inhibited alleles Figure 5 . We conclude that the C1 C2 dichotomy has arisen independently in both escape and inhibited lineages and that in escape line-ages , the dichotomy has arisen within the last 3–5MY . Within the escape group , the frequency of C1 alleles S77 N80 is 44 % , whereas that of C2 N77 K80 is 56 % . The functional importance and , more importantly , the maintenance of these polymorphisms , located at KIR inter-action sites of the HLA-C molecules , strongly suggest that selection plays a role in ensuring the functional diversity of alleles of the escape and inhibited groups . Four clades of HLA-C alleles can be identified on the tree of HLA-C alleles Figure 2 . The splits leading to the C*07 and the C*17 lineages occur earlier than the split leading to the remaining inhibited and escape lineages . Thus , three groupings of inhibited alleles can be defined 1 the C*07 alleles 2 the C*17 alleles and 3 the C*01 , C*03 , C*04 , and C*14 alleles . We refer to the latter group as C*X . The escape allelic lineages form a fourth group . We examined patterns of amino acid polymorphism by determining sequence logos for all unique alleles within each of the four defined groupings . Because we are inter-ested in residues that characterize each lineage , we limit the analysis to these 30 sites that are the most polymor-phic across the a1 and a2 domains of HLA-C. Figure 7 indicates the prevalence of amino acids in these most polymorphic positions . The extent of polymorphisms in the C*07 and C*17 lineages is limited . However , the sharing of polymorphisms between the inhibited C*X and the escape lineages is striking . Polymorphisms at posi-tions 9 , 21 , 24 , 66 , 73 , 77 , 80 , and 90 of the a-1 domain as well as positions 94 , 95 , 97 , 114 , 116 , 152 , 156 , and 163 of the a-2 domain are shared by both C*X and escape groups . Within and flanking the KIR binding sites , poly-morphisms at residues 73,77 , 80 , and 90 involve T A , S N , N K , and D A in both escape and inhibited lineages . The R H and A S polymorphisms of residues 21 and 24 are also seen in both lineage types . Additional shared polymorphisms are scattered along the peptide , as are sites that clearly differentiate lineage groups e.g. , S11 is found only in the C*X group , H113 is limited to escape lineages . The extent of sharing shows that escape alleles have acquired many of the polymorphisms that are present in inhibited HLA-C lineages . Phylogenetic trees of HLA-C alleles based on the amino acid distances found for these 30 variable sites also contain clades consist-ing of both escape and inhibited lineages not shown , indicating the close prox-imity of certain escape and inhibited line-ages when measured at critical polymor-phic sites . Both the high frequency of escape alleles and their extensive utiliza-tion of ancient polymorphisms in different lineages support the view that selection has been instrumental in the maintenance and diversification of escape lineages . The data presented herein indicate that a single gene-conversion event occurring in the 30 UTR of the HLA-C locus 3–5 MYA resulted in a lineage of HLA-C alleles that escape miRNA downregulation . Two observations indicate that the gene-conversion event leading to the escape lineage of HLA-C alleles almost certainly occurred only once . First , the escape feature is highly character-istic , involving a large segment of somewhere between 88 bp and 152 bp with multiple polymorphic sites that are shared between the escape HLA-C alleles and HLA-B , but which distinguish them from the inhibited HLA-C alleles . By this reasoning , the escape feature can be lik-ened to a cladistic marker for which homoplasy is un-likely.21 Second , all extant HLA-C alleles containing the escape variant group monophyletically with high boot-strap support . The conversion event that led to escape alleles thus shows complete congruence with the phy-logeny of the alleles that bear it , and descent from a single common ancestor provides the simplest explanation for the shared escape mechanism Figure 2 . Taken together , these data indicate that it is very unlikely and unneces-sary to postulate that the same gene-conversion event would occur a second time involving the same ancestral HLA-C allele . The escape HLA-C alleles are expressed at significantly higher levels on the cell surface than are those that are in-hibited by miR-148a . These high-expression HLA-C alleles have accumulated a substantial number of functional coding-region variants that are also present in the group of inhibited HLA-C alleles that contain an intact miR-148a binding site , the ancestral form of the 30 UTR . Among the shared variations are features involved in binding of KIR receptors as well as peptide-binding regions . The convergent evolution evident in the escape versus in-hibited lineages provides a strong argument in favor of selection for the high-expression HLA-C allotypes , which must maintain the functional polymorphisms characteristic of low-expression HLA-C allotypes . High-expression HLA-C alleles are associated with control of HIV viral load and slower disease progression.7,8 It is possible that these same alleles have conferred some level of protection against infectious diseases throughout hu-man history , resulting in an overall frequency in excess of 30 % worldwide and their presence in every population sampled in this study . Alternatively , we presume that the inhibited alleles also provide benefit , as they have been maintained over the past several million years since the escape allele first arose . The variation in miR-148a binding is unique to HLA-C as compared to HLA-B , where all alleles escape miR-148a binding , and HLA-A , where all alleles have an intact miR-148a binding site . This dimorphic feature of HLA-C adds to other unique characteristics of HLA-C , including relatively limited polymorphism and more extensive ligand-receptor interactions with KIR . Thus , the function of HLA-C alleles is dependent not only on their peptide specificities , but also on their expression levels as deter-mined by polymorphic regulatory elements outside of the protein-coding region . This may be true for HLA-A and –B , as well , but through mechanisms that do not involve miR-148a . Efforts are being made to incorporate a more comprehensive view of HLA variability by consid-ering such regions.9,17 A more inclusive view of HLA vari-ability might be facilitated by extending the sequence length in the IMGT HLA database to include sequences such as the 30 UTR . Certainly , a greater understanding of the nature of the diversity at the HLA class I loci and the mechanisms by which the diversity occurs , as described herein , may provide clues to its involvement in health and disease .

21907014	Genetic variants can have joint , nonadditive functional effects , 1–4 but characterizing such epistasis between common variants in humans has proven difficult , and undetected epistasis remains one potential reason for the low proportion of heritability of complex traits ex-plained by common genetic variants.5–10 In addition to gene-gene interactions , linked loci can also have epistatic effects , 11–14 one putative mechanism being the interaction between regulatory and coding variants of the same gene.15,16 Potential targets of these interactions are abun-dant cis-regulatory variation is common17–19 and has been estimated to affect at least 20 % of protein-coding variants within an individual in only a single tissue.16,20 In this study , we have analyzed population genetic signa-tures of a specific but probably abundant type of epistasis common cis-regulatoryvariationmodifyingthepenetrance of rare putatively deleterious coding variants . Our results indicate that such interactions are common and likely contribute to genetic predisposition to complex disease . Regulatory variation in cis might affect the penetrance of a deleterious coding variant of the same gene through allelic imbalance In individuals who are heterozygous for both a regulatory and a coding single nucleotide variant rSNV and cSNV , respectively , the deleterious coding allele might have a much more severe phenotypic outcome if it is more highly expressed than the other allele . This might make the coding heterozygote function-ally close to a deleterious homozygote Figure 1A . In such a situation , regulatory variation modifies the functional impact—and selection coefficient—of a deleterious coding variant , which might have a secondary effect also on the selection coefficient of the regulatory variant even when the change of gene expression level itself does not affect fitness . Importantly , whether or not a rare deleterious cSNV allele resides on the more highly or less expressed haplotype in a gene with cis-regulatory variation is not fully random the probability that a new coding mutation lands on a particular haplotype is equal to the haplotype frequency . Altogether , these phenomena can shape the patterns of both regulatory and coding variation , and in this paper we show that these specific patterns are common in the human genome . We analyzed genetic variation discovered in the low-coverage resequencing data of the 1000 Genomes Project pilot 1 and 2 release March 2010 , from 60 samples of European origin CEU [ Utah residents with ancestry from northern and western Europe ] and 58 Yoruba individuals from Nigeria YRI [ Yoruba in Ibadan , Nigeria ] .21 The study was approved by the institutional review boards of the Coriell Institute for Medical Research and the University Hospitals of Geneva . To analyze common regulatory varia-tion , we mapped expression quantitative trait loci eQTLs in cis by Spearman rank correlation by using gene expres-sion array data from transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines of 57 CEU and 56 YRI individuals and SNPs with MAF 5 % and less than 1 Mb from transcription start site , by using a permutation threshold of 0.0120 . This yielded a total of 433 eQTLs with ancestral allele informa-tion provided by the 1000 Genomes Consortium in CEU and 446 in YRI false discovery rate 25 % . We designate the more highly and less expressed rSNV alleles rSNV ? and rSNV , respectively , and classify the eQTLs in gain-of-expression GOE and loss-of-expression LOE variants according to the effect of the derived allele . Instead of testing all variants against all across the genome for statis-tical epistasis , we analyzed our data for specific patterns of variation predicted by our model of local epistasis . The model of epistasis predicts increased penetrance of deleterious cSNVs when the derived cSNV allele is on the more highly expressed haplotype in cSNV-rSNV double heterozygotes . These cases are most likely to arise when the rSNV has high heterozygosity , and novel putatively deleterious coding mutations hit the rSNV ? allele—that is , in common rSNVs with a high rSNV ? allele frequency . These rSNVs might be under increased purifying selection Figure 1B . We observe a signal consistent with this in the frequency distribution of eQTLs GOE eQTLs had significantly lower derived allele frequencies DAF than LOE eQTLs Figure 2 DAFGOE versus DAFLOE Mann-Whit-ney p ? 0.0092 in CEU and p ? 0.026 in YRI , that is , the rSNV ? alleles tend to have lower frequencies among common regulatory variants , consistently with epistatic selection . An alternative explanation to this pattern would be increased gene-expression levels being more deleterious in general but then the proportion of GOE rSNVs should grow exponentially toward lower rSNV frequencies . Because eQTL analysis does not capture rare regulatory variants , we investigated whether such a pattern can be observed by analyzing allele-specific expression ASE from RNA sequencing data of 60 CEU individ-uals.22 By using the frequency of the coding variant with rare ASE to predict which cSNV allele is linked to the derived allele of the unknown putative rare rSNV Fig-ure S1 , available online , we estimated that 78 5 12 % linear regression p ? 2.1 3 10 10 of rare rSNVs are loss-of-expression variants Figure S2 . Altogether , whereas common regulatory variants with DAF 5 % –50 % are pre-dominantly GOE , rare rSNVs—as well as common variants of DAF 50 % —appear to be usually LOE . This is inconsis-tent with the gain of expression being more deleterious in general and follows the predictions of the epistasis model Figure 1B . Furthermore , we analyzed the distribution of fold change of eQTLs calculated as the ratio of the median expression values of the major homozygote and the heterozygote eQTL genotype classes , which describes the magnitude of putative cSNV allelic imbalance and epistasis effect in eQTL heterozygotes . We observed that especially in CEU , common eQTLs with high frequency of the rSNV allele tend to have higher fold changes Figure S3 . These eQTLs are likely to have most coding mutations occurring on the rSNV haplotype and thus benefit from epistasis the bigger the allelic imbalance is , the lower the pene-trance of these cSNVs . Conversely , strong epistatic effects in eQTLs with high rSNV ? frequencies are more likely to be disadvantageous , which is consistent with their low fold changes . Thus , epistatic effects appear to shape not only the frequency spectrum of regulatory variants but also the distribution of the magnitude of their effect . Patterns of coding variation are also expected to be affected by epistasis . Increased purification of deleterious cSNV alleles from the more highly expressed haplotype might lead to different distribution of putatively delete-rious cSNVs and neutral cSNVs on the regulatory haplo-types . To investigate this , we compared nonsynonymous and synonymous SNVs nsSNVs and sSNVs , respectively , expecting the former to show stronger signs of interaction with rSNVs . First , epistasis would favor some haplotype combinations over others , which is expected to increase the overall linkage disequilibrium LD . Indeed , LD be-tween eQTLs and nsSNVs was stronger than for sSNVs Figures 3A and 3B and Figure S6 Mann-Whitney p values for CEU and YRI are 0.012 and 0.008 for D0 , and 0.002 and 0.078 , for r2 , respectively . This is consistent with our previous results based on RNA sequencing data from 60 CEU individuals.20 Second , we investigated whether this LD pattern is likely caused by underrepresentation of puta-tively deleterious coding alleles on the more highly ex-pressed haplotype . Analysis of allele-specific expression ASE data from the same RNA sequencing dataset22 showed that a larger proportion of nsSNVs than sSNVs showed decreased expression of the derived allele Figure 3C p ? 0.0035 for overall sSNV-nsSNV difference according to a linear regression model , and Fisher’s exact test p ? 0.046 for cSNVs with DAF 0.15 , see also Figures S1 and S2 . This analysis is unlikely to be biased because of nsSNVs being putatively more often causal regulatory variants themselves because such an autoregulatory mech-anism would be unlikely to cause allelic imbalance , and we have observed that ASE occurrence in sSNVs and nsSNVs overall is almost equal.20 Furthermore , in haplotype-phased eQTL data from the 1000 Genomes July 2010 release in CEU , the more highly expressed haplotype carried significantly fewer derived alleles of nsSNVs than of sSNVs Fisher’s exact test p ? 2 3 10 4 , Table S2 . These results suggest that epistatic selection leads to deficiency of deleterious coding variation on the more highly ex-pressed regulatory haplotype . Additionally , we investi-gated whether epistasis can also affect the total number of coding variants in genes with regulatory variation , and we observed that the number of cSNVs was decreased in eQTL genes Mann-Whitney p 2.2 3 10 16 in CEU , p ? 6.4 3 10 3 in YRI Figure S3 and , importantly , was decreased even more in CEU when the rSNV ? allele was common this suggests that epistasis might expose coding variants to selection and lead to increased purifying selection . Finally , we asked whether epistatic effects might play a role in genetic predisposition to complex disease , with an enrichment of deleterious alleles on the more highly ex-pressed haplotype potentially increasing disease risk . To this end , we used the Regulatory Trait Concordance score23 to define 98 disease-associated eQTLs in which the eQTL is likely to tag the same variant as a GWAS SNP from NHGRI catalog24 accessed April 12 , 2010 and compared them to 934 control eQTLs . This analysis was based on a dataset of 75 European individuals with geno-types imputed to HapMap2 and array expression data from fibroblasts , T cells , and LCLs.25 Figure 4A shows an enrichment of disease eQTLs in high frequencies of the rSNV ? allele , when random coding mutations are more likely to hit this haplotype and possibly have increased penetrance . This trend is opposite to that observed for eQTLs overall—suggesting that the variants not following the general pattern putatively optimized by evolution are more likely to contribute to disease . Furthermore , the disease risk allele is more often the eQTL ? allele or linked to it 21 30 cases with available data , c2 test p ? 0.023 , Figure 4B —although this pattern alone but not the frequency pattern in Figure 4A could be caused by the increased expression level itself being detrimental . Alto-gether , these results suggest that a proportion of disease associations due to regulatory variants might arise from the dysfunction of the rSNV ? allele because it increases the penetrance of linked cSNVs . However , we did not observe significant differences in the patterns of coding variation in the 60 CEU individuals between genes with disease-associated and control eQTLs Figure S6 . Future studies with case-control material will , we hope , clarify whether increased disease risk sometimes arises neither from changed gene-expression levels alone nor from an enrichment of rare cSNVs per se but from their interaction . Table S3 gives a list of disease-associated eQTLs with a high frequency of the more highly expressed haplotype these would be the best candidates for searching for the epistatic effect . In conclusion , our study illustrates how epistasis between coding and cis-regulatory variants has shaped the spectrum of genetic variation in the human genome . The straightforward principle of interaction recapitulates many of the phenomena observed in the data and opens ground for future research of the role of epistasis in , for example , tissue specificity25 and genetic associations to complex disease.6,7,11 In future studies , more refined models characterizing the population genetic dynamics of epistasis will , we hope , shed light on differences between populations , genetic load caused by epistasis , and evolutionary equilibria.26 Additionally , this type of epistasis might contribute to varying penetrance of Mendelian disorders , 27 in which the penetrance of a rare disease-causing allele could be modified by the individual’s genotype of a common regulatory variant of that gene . In this study we focused on interactions between common rSNVs and rare cSNVs , but the accumulating genomic and RNA sequencing data will enable analysis of modi-fying effects that rare regulatory variation might have on both rare and common coding variation . Altogether , our results show that the functional effects of regulatory variation often extend beyond gene-expression levels and that the impact of rare coding variants is fre-quently modified by regulatory variation . This might have important practical implications for understanding functional effects of genetic variants—and this specific type of genetic interaction can be relatively easily detected from sequencing data in a genome-wide manner , as out-lined in this study . Phenotypic associations to regulatory variants have only rarely led to characterization of expres-sion differences underlying the phenotype , 18 and our results suggest that a proportion of these signals might actually be driven not by expression change itself but by increased penetrance of deleterious coding variants . Additionally , considerable effort is being directed to the discovery of loss-of-function coding variants from genome or exome sequencing data . Thus far , these data have rarely been complemented with RNA sequencing data from rele-vant tissues to understand how the predicted functional effect is actually manifested in the downstream pathways of the cell and in the phenotype . In the future , the inte-grated analysis of regulatory and coding variants will be important in characterizing the genetic sources of pheno-typic variation in humans .

21908582	PURPOSE . To explore an alternative etiology for Purtscher reti-nopathy by literature review and fluid dynamic computational simulations of wall shear stress WSS profiles . METHODS . Computer simulations were developed , incorporat-ing posterior pole retinal microvascular flow parameters , to demonstrate WSS profiles at 90° and 45° angle artery arteriolar branching . RESULTS . Computer simulations reveal WSS profiles dependent on artery arteriolar branching angles . At high flow rates an area of changed WSS and flow swirling and reversal was noted at the proximal fillet of the 90° arteriolar branching . These changes did not appear at the 45° arteriolar branching until the flow rate was increased an additional 30 % . CONCLUSIONS . Computer simulation data , as well as review of the history and clinical findings of Purtscher and Purtscher-like retinopathy , present evidence that an additional etiology for Purtscher retinopathy may be a rheological event at a retinal posterior pole foci of vascular endothelial dysregulation , fol-lowed by downstream endothelin-induced vasculopathy . In-vest Ophthalmol Vis Sci . 2011 52 8102–8107 DOI 10.1167 iovs.11-7734 Pserved , urtscher retinopathy is a well known , but seldom ob-member of traumatic retinopathies that has defied member of traumatic retinopathies that has defied an exact etiology since it was first described by Purtscher a century ago.1 Purtscher observed a delayed posterior pole retinopathy with hemorrhages and exudates in males who had sustained head injuries . Shortly after Purtscher’s original de-scription , a similar constellation of findings were described in individuals with compressive chest injuries.2 In the ensuing years Purtscher retinopathy has been associated with a confus-ing number of seemingly disparate traumatic and nontraumatic diseases . Clinical findings of Purtscher retinopathy and Purtscher-like retinopathy have been described in numerous articles , re-views , and textbooks . They consist of delayed involvement of the retinal posterior pole layers with ischemic lesions of the superficial nerve-fiber layer cotton wool spots , infarcts of the retinal capillary bed Purtscher Flecken , flame hemorrhages nerve-fiber layer , and dot blot hemorrhages deeper retinal layers . Optic nerve edema and hemorrhage are common . Involvement of the choroid , retinal pigment epithelium is less common , but when it does occur , can be responsible for persistent vision loss . Studies have shown vascular endothelial response to spatio-temporal gradients of wall shear stress WSS effects of down-stream vascular autoregulation.3 Mechanical and toxic mi-croenvironments to which vascular endothelial cells are exposed can result in acute and or chronic endothelial dys-regulation . Other studies provide evidence that the environ-ment to which endothelial cells are exposed is , in part , depen-dent on the angle of artery arteriolar branching with flow separation and reversals occurring more readily at obtuse angle branching than that at acute angle branching.3,4 These findings suggest that a susceptible focus of vasculopathy may exist upstream in the retinal posterior pole vascular system where Purtscher retinopathy clinical presentations converge .

METHODS Investigative Ophthalmology Visual Science , October 2011 , Vol . 52 , No. 11 Copyright 2011 The Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology , Inc . RESULTS Normal Blood Flow Along S1 Fig. 6 , with normal blood flow conditions Table 1 , there are no significant WSS profile differences between 90° and 45° arteriolar bifurcation angles . Dimensions of the 90° and 45° Bifurcation Models 90° 45° Retinal Blood Flow RBF and the Inlet Velocity at the MVs Along S2 Fig. 7 , with normal blood flow , both 45° and 90° branch angle profiles show a sharp increase in WSS at the upstream fillet . For the 90° angle branching , the WSS increase initiates from the main artery shortly before the proximal fillet and reaches a maximum at point E . This maximum value is followed by a sharp decrease in WSS that reaches a minimum at point F. Again along S2 Fig. 7 and for the 45° WSS profile , the sharp increase in WSS initiates at the artery somewhat before the fillet region and reaches a maximum at point E followed by a minimum at point F . The maximum 90° angle WSS is 14.5 % higher than the maximum WSS of the 45° angle branch . The minimum 90° branch WSS at point F is 34.5 % higher than the minimum WSS of the 45° branch at point F . For S3 , with normal blood flow conditions Table 1 , both 90° and 45° WSS profiles behave similarly Fig. 8 . Of interest is that the WSS value at point B of the 45° angle branch is 25.3 % higher than the corresponding value of the 90° branch-ing point B . The WSS value at point D of the 45° branching is 2.87 % higher than the corresponding value of the 90° branching point D . The first maximum WSS , for the 45° branching at B , is 11.9 % lower than the second global max-imum occurring at D . In addition , for the 90° branching first maximum WSS occurring at B is 27.7 % lower than the second global maximum occurring at D. Note that the shear stress at points C and C are zero since these are bifurcation points for the flow streamlines . Twenty-Five Times Normal Blood Flow Along S1 , for 25 times the normal blood flow rate Fig. 9 , the WSS drop pattern , noted at normal blood flow , reverses . The WSS drop of the 90° branching point A is steeper compared with the smoother WSS drop of the 45° branching point A . Along S2 , for 25 times the normal blood flow rate Fig. 10 , WSS patterns similar to those occurring with normal blood flow conditions are noted . However , for the 90° branching , after reaching a maximum WSS value at point E , the WSS does not directly drop to a minimum value as seen with normal blood flow . Rather , it drops to a minimum at point X , followed by a small WSS increase to point Y , and then decreases to a second global minimum at point F. The occurrence of this WSS behavior is due to swirling blood flow observed in the 90° branching angle at high flow levels Fig. 3 , which is not observed at normal blood flow Fig. 2 . This swirling pattern is not seen in the 45° branching unless the blood flow is in-creased an additional 30 % . Along S3 , for 25 times the normal blood flow rate Fig. 11 and for both 45° and 90° angle branching , a sharp increase in WSS values is noted at B and B. Point B of the 45° branching is 43.9 % higher than the corresponding value for the 90° branching at point B. After the two lines drop to zero at the distal fillet points C and C , the WSS sharply increases and reaches a second local WSS maximum at points D and D. At this point the 45° branching is 6.36 % higher than the 90° branching . Further , for the 45° branching , the first global maximum WSS occurring at B is 35.1 % higher than the second local maximum occurring at D . Note that under normal blood flow conditions Fig. 8 , the WSS at B is 11.9 % lower than that of point D . Thus , the WSS pattern has reversed . For the 90° branching the first maximum WSS occurring at B is only slightly 0.19 % lower than the second maximum occur-ring at D. Under normal blood flow conditions Fig. 8 , the WSS value at point B is 27.7 % lower than that at point D , whereas at 25 times normal blood flow both values for points B and D , Fig. 11 are almost equal . DISCUSSION The etiology of Purtscher and Purtscher-like retinopathy has been investigated chiefly by focus on a specific disease or set of diseases in which Purtscher retinopathy has been observed . Review of these diseases suggests they fall into three catego-ries toxic and or obstructive emboli , intravascular volume surges , and intracephalic shock waves . Presently , retinal arteriolar and capillary embolism with microinfarction is considered the most acceptable etiology for Purtscher retinopathy and there is pathologic and experimen-tal evidence to support this hypothesis.19–22 A serious argument against end organ capillary embolization as the only etiology for Purtscher retinopathy is the occurrence of Purtscher retinopathy in nonembolic syndromes , head trauma , and chest compression injuries . In addition the delayed clinical signs of Purtscher retinopathy would be more typical of nonembolic toxic ischemia rather than embolic vascular obstructive disease . The fact that Purtscher retinopathy occurs rarely , bilater-ally , unilaterally , and associated with many disparate diseases suggests an unusual and complex interaction of vascular ana-tomic and physiological events . Retinal Microvascular System The inner retinal microvascular system has three aspects , which makes it uniquely vulnerable to endothelial dysregula-tion . It is , unlike the choriocapillaris , a terminal vascular com-plex , unfenestrated , and autoregulated . The microvascular sys-tem of the inner retinal is derived from the central retinal artery and is a terminal system with no anastomoses outside the retina . Branches from the central retinal artery form two cap-illary plexi , one within the ganglion cell layer and the other in the inner nuclear layer . Rarely do capillaries from these plexi extend into the outer plexiform layer . At the fovea , the layers of the inner retinal thin to form the foveal pit . At this point there are no inner retinal vessels . Inner retinal vascular endothelia respond to mechanical , hormonal , and chemical flow stimuli by the production of autoregulators , among which are nitric oxide , prostacyclin , and endothelin peptides to achieve downstream vascular bal-ance.23,24 Endothelial dysregulation , as seen in atherosclerosis , hyper-tension , diabetes , and hypercholesterolemia as well as in cases of dysregulatory spatiotemporal variations of WSS , results in reduced production of nitric oxide as well as increased pro-duction of endothelins , which results in downstream vasocon-striction.25 Wall Shear Stress Vascular equilibrium , in a closed autoregulated system such as the inner retinal microvascular system , depends on being able to sense local blood flow dynamics . This signal transduction process is mediated through vascular endothelial cells.26 Endo-thelial cells respond to spatiotemporal gradients of flow affect-ing downstream vascular autoregulation.27,28 Wall shear stress as the relation between force pressure and the longitudinal axial force becomes the key mechanosignal transducer of in-formation between the blood and the vessel wall.26 Retinal Microcirculation Geometry Microcirculation system bifurcation angles have been shown to begin with obtuse branching and then develop to acute angles as the system progresses into capillaries.29 The retinal micro-circulation is no exception . The India ink preparations of Paul Henkind29 reveal the artery arteriole branchings in the retinal posterior pole to be predominantly at right or obtuse angles , as opposed to the periphery where there is a broad capillary network of acute angle dichotomous branchings.29,30 Apple and Rabb31 describe the retinal posterior pole vascular system to bend sharply and vertically into the retina . Variable wall shear stress throughout the vascular system , especially at vessel branching , results in complex chains of rheological events that can produce areas of disease predi-lection . Data from studies of cardiac lesions , 32,33 intracranial aneurysms , 34 abdominal aneurysms , 35 and atherosclerotic plaques36 show the effect of vascular culprit areas , vulner-able to rupture , atherosclerosis , and trauma . Retinal Vascular Endothelium Vascular endothelial dysregulation with endothelin production as part of Purtscher and Purtscher-like retinopathy has been suggested by some authors.28 Blood , in disease situations , to which retinal endothelial cells are exposed , contains potential endothelial dysregulatory substances that have been known to be associated with Purtscher-like retinopathy . These toxic ag-gregations do not necessarily need to be embolic at terminal capillaries , but can cause upstream endothelial dysregulation by way of WSS alterations , augmenting cellular aggregation and cellular adherence to retinal vascular endothelium . Endothelin peptides are powerful vasoconstrictors that are normally produced by vascular endothelium . In disease states , dysregulated endothelium overproduces these vasoconstric-tive substances . Endothelin-1 is found systemically elevated in septic and endotoxic shock syndromes , such as renal failure , 37 hemolysis , elevated liver enzymes and low platelet of “HELLP” syndrome , 38 and adult Still disease.39 It is with these systemic diseases , associated with abnormal systemic endothelin , that Purtscher retinopathy is associated . Optic Nerve One of the more universal aspects of Purtscher and Purtscher-like retinopathy is optic nerve involvement . Hayreh40 has dem-onstrated that the vascular supply of the optic nerve is variable and individualistic . It is logical to assume that the branching angles of optic nerve vascular supply would follow the usual obtuse to acute angle configuration of vascular microsys-tems.3,4 Studies have shown that the optic nerve head is auto-regulated and is thereby susceptible to endothelial direction.41 Optic nerve vascular homeostasis follows the same vascular homeostasis of retinal vessels , that is , a balance dependent on factors emerging from upstream endothelium . Flammer and others42,43 have made the observation that vascular endothelial dysregulation syndrome with diffusion of endothelin to the optic nerve head results in vasoconstriction and increases the risk for venous occlusion as well as weaken-ing the blood–brain barrier . They suggest that the pathogene-sis of glaucomatous optic neuropathy is due , in part , to vascu-lar endothelial dysregulation . Literature suggests that endothelial dysregulation with an out-pouring of vasoconstrictive endothelins , with or without emboli-zation , may produce Purtscher retinopathy . Clinical characteris-tics of Purtscher retinopathy point to a posterior pole focus of dysregulation , where blood flow patterns allow damage at critical endothelial areas i.e. , the 90° angle branching as noted in the above-cited computer simulations . Irregular blood flow with flow separation and retrograde flow , under traumatic circum-stances , may result in endothelial dysregulation . Limitations Involvement of choroid , retinal pigment epithelium , and macula have been reported in cases of Purtscher retinopathy . Often these findings are associated with head injury where ancillary trauma can be incriminated . However , there are cases of nontraumatic disease such as toxic embolization , cellular aggregation and adhe-sion , as well as vasoconstrictive and vasoocclusive events , where choroid and macular disease have been described.44 Although vision recovery is not uncommon in cases of Purtscher retinopa-thy , chronic vision loss secondary to macular and retinal pigment epithelium damage does occur . More commonly permanent vi-sual loss is secondary to optic atrophy . These unusual findings should not detract from the above-proposed hypothesis , but rather be considered as pathology that has occurred in association with classic Purtscher retinopathy , but not necessarily related to the pathophysiology of endothelial dysregulation . The effect of intracephalic shock wave is affected by many variables , such as media density , shock vector direction , mag-nitude of trauma , and others . These complex variables , as related to Purtscher retinopathy , attest to the rarity and multi-ple clinical presentations after head trauma . The preceding computer programs were not developed to demonstrate a profile for intracephalic shock waves as they encounter a perpendicular arteriolar branch as opposed to a profile for an encounter with a dichotomous acute angle branch . Further computer simulation studies are planned to investigate the extravascular shock wave effect on endothelial dysregulation . To elicit wall shear stress flow disruptions within our com-puter models , flow rates were increased 25 times above the normal flow rate . Our purpose was to demonstrate that at ex-tremes of flow , 90° angle branchings , common to the retinal posterior pole , are more susceptible to flow disturbances and subsequent endothelial dysregulation than are 45° angle branch-ings . By keeping flow rates constant , although high , we were able to more accurately compare , as a single variable , branching angles . There is thought that the retinal vascular Reynolds number is too low to reach disturbed flow conditions . However , our study shows that , although the retinal Reynolds number is linear with retinal blood flow rate from the definition of Reynolds number , the increase of WSS with Reynolds number or , alternatively , flow rate is nonlinear . In fact , it rises more rapidly at the rate of a third-order polynomial Figs. 12 , 13 . This suggests that WSS values , especially at bifurcation regions as shown here , are very sensitive to changes in the blood flow rate these changes may be responsible for Purtscher retinopathy . Treatment Avenues The above-cited hypothesis provides evidence for research into an avenue of treatment for Purtscher retinopathy . Endothelin receptor antagonists are now being tested for treatment of a variety of conditions , including pulmonary hypertension , conges-tive heart failure , renal failure , cancer , cerebrovascular disease , hypertensive retinopathy , and glaucoma . A productive avenue of research may be to evaluate endothelin receptor antagonists in the management of Purtscher and Purtscher-like retinopathy . CONCLUSIONS It is difficult not to incriminate capillary embolic occlusion in the etiology of Purtscher retinopathy , and indeed the syn-drome does involve occlusive end organ vasculopathy as noted by fluorescein , experimental , and pathologic evidence . These studies can not be ignored . However , limiting our perspective to capillary emboli ignores a number of perplexing contradic-tions associated with this rare disease and suggests a compre-hensive etiology has been incompletely described . The preceding computer simulation studies of WSS profiles comparing 90° angle vs. 45° arteriolar branching reveal an area , at the 90° angle artery arteriolar branching , where the margin between physiological and disruptive flow is narrow . It is at this culprit junction where endothelial dysregulation , under stressful conditions , is more likely to occur . Computer dynamic flow simulations , in addition to literature review , suggest that a possible additional pathophysiology that initiates Purtscher retinopathy , within a milieu of embolization , volume surges , and extravascular shock waves , may be an inner layer retinal posterior pole rheological event that results in vascular endo-thelial dysregulation . This endothelial dysregulation with pathogenic release of endothelins may contribute to down-stream occlusive vasculopathy of Purtscher retinopathy . References 1 . Purtscher O.

21911587	PURPOSE . The CTNND2 gene is located in the linkage interval of high myopia locus MYP16 and two single-nucleotide polymor-phisms SNPs rs6885224 and rs12716080 in CTNND2 were recently shown to associate with high myopia . This study evaluated such associations in an independent case-control series . METHODS . A total of 2773 unrelated individuals were enrolled in this study , including 1203 subjects with high myopia spherical refraction at each meridian 6.00 D , 615 subjects with moderate myopia 6.00 D spherical refraction 4.00 D , and 955 controls 0.50 D to 1.00 D , spherical equiva-lent . Genomic DNA was prepared from venous leukocytes . SNPs rs6885224 and rs12716080 in CTNND2 were determined by Sanger sequencing . Allele and genotype frequencies of the SNPs were compared between cases and controls by 2 test 0.05 . RESULTS . One SNP , rs6885224 , in CTNND2 showed significant differences in genotype and allele frequencies between high myopia and controls genotype P 2.17E 10 5 , allele P 5.29E 10 6 , odds ratio [ OR ] 0.69 , 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] 0.591–0.812 , as well as between moderate myopia and controls genotype P 0.009 , allele P 0.005 , OR 0.765 , 95 % CI 0.633–0.924 . rs12716080 showed no statistical difference between myopias and controls . CONCLUSIONS . These results confirmed the strong association between CTNND2 polymorphism and myopia . The minor al-lele C of rs6885224 was protective against myopia in this study but was a risk allele in a previous study . Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci . 2011 52 8258–8261 DOI 10.1167 iovs.11-7914 Mwith yopia is the most common cause of visual impairment , an average prevalence of 30 % worldwide.1–3 It af - an average prevalence of 30 % worldwide.1–3 It af-fects approximately 50 % to 70 % of populations in some urban areas in East Asia.4–8 High myopia , defined as refractive error equal to or greater than 6 D , is a leading cause of blindness due to its associated myopic retinopathy and other complica - tions.9,10 Both environmental factors and genetic factors con-tribute to myopia development , 11–15 whereas the molecular mechanism of myopia is still undetermined . Molecular genetic study provides a unique tool to investi-gate the molecular basis of myopia . Linkage studies have mapped at least 17 myopia susceptibility loci , such as MYP1–3 and MYP5–18.16–29 Genome-wide association studies GWAS have identified single-nucleotide polymorphisms SNPs in dif-ferent chromosomal regions significantly associated with myo-pia.30–32 However , the exact responsible genes in these loci await further studies . Of those myopia susceptible loci , one , MYP16 MIM 612554 , was mapped to chromosome 5p15.33-p15.2 based on linkage evidence of three Chinese families with autosomal dominant high myopia.27 Recently , a GWAS study identified a strong association between high myopia and genetic variations in CTNND2,33 which is located inside the linkage interval of MYP16 . It would be of interest to know whether this associa-tion can be replicated by independent studies . In this study , association of the two reported SNPs rs6885224 and rs12716080 in CTNND2 with myopia was evaluated in an independent case-control series . Disclosure B. Lu , None D. Jiang , None P.

These two SNPs in each group were in HWE . One SNP , rs6885224 , showed significant differences in genotype and allele frequencies between high myopia and controls genotype P 2.17E 10 5 , allele P 5.29E 10 6 , OR 0.69 , 95 % CI 0.591–0.812 , as well as between moderate myopia and controls genotype P 0.009 , allele P 0.005 , OR 0.765 , 95 % CI 0.633–0.924 . The other SNP , rs12716080 , showed no significant differences ei-ther between high myopia and controls or between moderate myopia and controls Table 3 . Based on the genotype data of 2773 samples , r2 0.517 0.80 was figured out , which indicates that these two SNPs are not in linkage disequilibrium . The minor allele C of rs6885224 was protective against myopia in this study but was a risk allele in the previous study.33 DISCUSSION Previously , a genome-wide linkage scan mapped a myopia locus MYP16 , MIM 612554 on chromosome 5p15.33-p15.2 , based on analysis of three Chinese families with autosomal dominant high myopia living in Hong Kong.27 This locus was further supported by an additional genome-wide linkage scan of Asian families.37 Recently , a GWAS study on Singapore Chinese revealed that genetic variations in the noncoding re-gion of CTNND2 , the SNPs rs6885224 and rs12716080 , were associated with high myopia.33 The CTNND2 gene is located inside the linkage interval of MYP16 . In this study , the SNPs rs6885224 and rs12716080 in CTNND2 were analyzed in 1818 myopia subjects 1203 with high myopia and 615 with mod-erate myopia and 955 normal controls . Our results not only confirmed the association between rs6885224 in CTNND2 and high myopia , but also suggested that this SNP may associate with moderate myopia in the Chinese population . These lines of evidence suggested that MYP16 might be a common locus responsible for high myopia in Chinese as well as in Japanese . Whether the genetic variants in CTNND2 are associated with high myopia in other populations requires further studies . CTNND2 encodes an adhesive junction associated protein of the armadillo -catena super family , which interacts with several transcriptional factors such as Pax6 , E2F1 , and Hes138–40 and is involved in brain and eye development and cancer formation.41,42 Heterozygous deletion of CTNND2 was TABLE 3 .

The SNP rs6885224 is situated in the noncoding region of CTNND2 . A 20-kilobase genomic DNA region encompassing rs6885224 in CTNND2 is speculated to regulate mRNA tran-scription http genome.ucsc.edu University of California , Santa Cruz , Santa Cruz , CA and , therefore , may affect the expression of gene CTNND2 . Similarly , the noncoding region was also suggested to play a possible regulatory role in two other GWAS studies for myopia , 31,32 where significant associ-ations were found between genomic regions at 15q14 and 15q25 and myopia but there were no coding sequence varia-tions . The association was found only for rs6885224 but not for rs12716080 in this study . A previous study suggested that these two SNPs were in linkage disequilibrium with r2 0.89 . However , our data suggested these two SNPs are not in linkage disequilibrium , with r2 0.517 . This may explain that only one of the two SNPs is associated with myopia in our study . As observed in this study , the effect direction of the minor allele at rs6885224 was in the opposite direction compared with the original study.33 Several previous association studies on other diseases have also reported that the minor allele was observed in the opposite direction for a certain disease in different studies.46–52 Lin et al.53 demonstrated that multilocus effects and variation in interlocus correlations contributed to this phenomenon . One possible explanation is that the ances-try variations predisposed to myopia may occur independently on different alleles in different study populations . Elucidating the functional variations predisposing to myopia at this locus in further studies may lead to the understanding of this mystery . In conclusion , our study supports the association between SNP rs6885224 in CTNND2 and high myopia . This result to-gether with previous linkage and GWAS studies imply that the genomic region around rs6885224 in CTNND2 may be an important locus predisposing myopia in Chinese population . Additional studies are expected to reveal how the SNPs in CTNND2 could be associated with high myopia . Acknowledgments The authors thank all subjects for their participation .

21917933	Meshwork Cells PURPOSE . Transforming growth factor beta 2 TGF is often elevated in the aqueous humor AH and trabecular meshwork 2 TM of patients with primary open-angle glaucoma POAG and appears to contribute to POAG pathogenesis . To better understand TGF signaling in the eye , TGF -induced pro-teomic changes were 2 identified in cells cultured 2 from the TM , a tissue involved in intraocular pressure IOP elevation in glaucoma . METHODS . Primary cultures of human TM cells from four donors were treated with or without TGF 5 ng mL for 48 hours then cellular protein was analyzed by 2 liquid chromatography– mass spectrometry iTRAQ isobaric tags for relative and abso-lute quantitation technology . RESULTS . A total of 853 proteins were quantified . TGF treat-ment significantly altered the abundance of 47 proteins , 2 40 of which have not previously been associated with TGF signal-ing in the eye . More than half the 30 elevated proteins 2 support growing evidence that TGF induces extracellular matrix re-modeling and abnormal cytoskeletal 2 interactions in the TM . The levels of 17 proteins were reduced , including four cyto-skeletal and six regulatory proteins . Both elevated and de-creased regulatory proteins implicate TGF -altered processes involving transcription , translation , and the 2 glutamate glu-tamine cycle . Altered levels of eight mitochondrial proteins support TGF -induced mitochondrial dysfunction in the TM that in POAG could 2 contribute to oxidative damage in the AH outflow pathway , TM senescence , and elevated IOP . CONCLUSIONS . The results expand the repertoire of proteins known to participate in TGF signaling , provide new molec-ular insight into POAG , and establish 2 a quantitative proteomics database for the TM that includes candidate glaucoma biomark - 2 ers for future validation studies . Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci . 2011 52 8287–8294 DOI 10.1167 iovs.11-8218 Pform rimary open-angle glaucoma POAG is the most common of the primary glaucomas and affects approximately 3 of the primary glaucomas and affects approximately 3 million Americans and more than 70 million people world-wide.1 Visual loss in POAG results from damage to retinal ganglion cells and the optic nerve advanced age and elevated intraocular pressure IOP are risk factors.2,3 A significant pro-portion of POAG patients have what is termed normal-tension glaucoma in which IOP remains in the normal range and the cause of the neuropathy is unclear.4 Nevertheless , IOP is still a major risk factor in normal-tension glaucoma because further lowering of IOP decreases disease progression . Despite the high prevalence of POAG and the identification of glaucoma susceptibility genes , 5 the molecular mechanisms of glaucoma are poorly understood . Elevated IOP in POAG appears related to pathologic changes in the aqueous humor AH outflow pathway that cause increased outflow resistance , particularly in the trabecular meshwork TM . Abnormal accumulation of extracellular matrix ECM , 6,7 abnormal protein expression , 8 and changes in cytoskeletal interactions9,10 within the TM have been associated with increased AH outflow resistance and elevated IOP . Oxidative damage may also contribute to ele-vated IOP11 and play a role in POAG.12,13 Transforming growth factor beta 2 TGF is an immuno-suppressive factor in normal human AH that helps 2 maintain the immune privilege of the eye.14,15 In addition to elevated levels of TGF in the AH of POAG patients , as shown in numerous studies , 16–18 2 TGF 2 is elevated in glaucomatous TM tissues and cultured glaucomatous TM cells.19 In vitro studies in the TM show that TGF can induce ECM remodeling , 20,21 inhibit cell proliferation , 22 2 induce senescence-like changes , 23 and al-ter the actin cytoskeleton . Elsewhere in the body , TGF me-diates increased ECM deposition and has been implicated 2 in fibrosis of the liver , 24 kidney , 25 and lung.26 Gene expression studies have reported changes in TGF -treated TM cells , 21,27,28 including increased levels of transcripts 2 encoding ECM and cyto-skeletal components . Organ culture studies in which the anterior segment of human and porcine eyes is perfused with TGF have reported increased IOP and ECM deposition in the AH drainage 2 Disclosure K.E .

Liquid 2 chromatography–mass spec-trometry LC MS MS isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation iTRAQ Applied Biosystems , Foster City , CA technology was used to quantify TGF -induced protein changes in TM cells .

Trabecular Meshwork Cell Samples Donor Protein Age and Cell Analyzed Experiment Cell Culture Sex Passage g ated with TGF signaling in the TM . The results provide new molecular insight 2 into the consequences of TGF signaling in ocular hypertension and POAG. 2 METHODS TM Cell Cultures performed with The Protein ANalysis THrough Evolutionary Relation - RESULTS From four primary cultures of human TM cells treated or untreated with TGF , a total of 853 proteins were identified and quantified with two 2 or more peptides by LC MS MS and iTRAQ quantification code written in R. The TM cell samples were from normal n 2 and glaucomatous n 2 donor eyes Table 1 . Quantitative results from each cell sample are presented in Supplementary Tables S1–S4 http www.iovs . org lookup suppl doi 10.1167 iovs.11-8218 -DCSupplemental , in-cluding protein ratios , SDs , P values , number of unique peptides quantified , percentage sequence coverage for each protein , and peptide false discovery rates . The data from all four TM samples were of comparable quality and appropriate for averaging based on con-sistently low peptide false discovery average rates , 2.1 % identity , 3.0 % homology and similar distributions of protein ratios . The aver-age relative abundance of the 853 quantified proteins is presented in Supplementary Table S5 http www.iovs.org lookup suppl doi 10.1167 iovs.11-8218 -DCSupplemental , and the distribution of mean protein ratios for all proteins and those quantified in three or more TM samples n 450 are shown in Figure 1 . The distributions in Figure 1 are slightly skewed , indicating that more proteins were increased in abundance than were decreased by TGF treatment . Criteria for determining whether a protein was elevated 2 or decreased included the average adjusted protein ratio and P value , with only proteins quantified in three or more cell samples used for comparative purposes . Proteins exhibiting aver-age protein ratios adjusted by SEM above or below the mean by at least 1 SD Fig. 1 and P 0.06 were considered of higher or lower abundance . Majority of the Determined Proteome Reflects That of Untreated TM Cells Approximately 95 % of the 853 quantified proteins and 90 % of the 450 proteins quantified in three or more samples Supple-mentary Table S5 , http www.iovs.org lookup suppl doi 10.1167 iovs.11-8218 -DCSupplemental were present in sim-ilar amounts in TGF -treated and untreated TM cells . Accordingly , the overall 2 determined proteome largely reflects that of untreated TM cells . The quantified proteins include 5 % secreted , 46 % cytoplasmic , 22 % membrane and mem-brane-associated , 15 % nuclear , and 12 % mitochondrial pro-teins . Among the significant proteomic changes after TGF treatment , more secreted proteins were elevated 20 % than 2 decreased 0 % and twice as many mitochondrial proteins were decreased 41 % than elevated 20 % . TABLE 2 . Elevated Proteins in TGF 2-Treated Human TM Cells TM Proteins Increased by TGF Thirty proteins were elevated 1 SD P 0.06 above the mean ratio after TGF treatment , including 11 proteins ele-vated 2 SD Table 2 . 2 The majority of these proteins have not previously been associated with TGF signaling in the TM however , more than 50 % can be grouped by function into processes previously associated with TGF treatment , such as ECM remodeling and cytoskeletal interactions . For example , among the most elevated proteins were ECM-associated SPARC secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine , CTGF connec-tive tissue growth factor , cytoskeletal-associated myosin reg-ulatory light chain 9 , and caldesmon . Approximately 20 % of the elevated proteins can be grouped into protein binding , folding , and chaperone processes , and another 26 % can be grouped into regulatory processes involving transcription , translation , steroid binding , and mitochondrial metabolism . Proteins significantly increased in abundance by TGF treat-ment account for 7 % of those quantified in three or 2 more samples . ECM Remodeling Cytoskeletal Interactions Protein Folding and Chaperone Processes Regulatory Processes TABLE 3 . Decreased Proteins in TGF -Treated Human TM Cells Signaling Regulation Cytoskeletal Interactions Mitochondrial Metabolism TM Proteins Decreased by TGF In response to TGF treatment , 17 proteins were decreased in abundance 1 SD P 2 0.06 below the mean ratio Table 3 none of these proteins have previously been associated with TGF signaling in TM cells . CD9 antigen and mitochondrial superoxide 2 dismutase 2 SOD2 were the most significantly reduced proteins decreased 64 % and 46 % , respectively . Four of the reduced proteins are associated with cytoskeletal interactions and six with a variety of regulatory processes , including transcription , translation , and the immune response . Notably , more than 40 % of the decreased proteins were from the mitochondria and are involved in critical metabolic func-tions . Proteins significantly reduced in abundance accounted for 4 % of those quantified in three or more samples . Western blot analysis was used to independently evaluate pro-teomic changes in the TM cell samples with and without TGF treatment . Densitometric results Fig. 2 from immuno-blots 2 corroborated increased amounts of caldesmon and de-creased amounts of SOD2 after TGF treatment and were in reasonable agreement with the iTRAQ 2 data in both ratios and P values . Reports in the literature support TGF -induced changes observed for at least six other proteins . Specifically , 2 Western blot analyses published by others show that TGF treatment of human TM cells results in increased amounts of 2 SPARC , 34 CTGF , 35 thrombospondin-1,35 and -crystallin B36 and that CTGF treatment of human TM cells results in elevated levels of collagen 1 type III.37 In addition , a previous pro-teomic study reported TGF induced increased amounts of transgelin-2 , -crystallin B , and 2 possibly 78 kDa glucose-regu-lated protein in TM cells based on 2D gel spot staining inten-sity.27 DISCUSSION To better understand TGF signaling in the anterior segment , we quantified proteomic changes 2 in four primary cultures of human TM cells after TGF treatment using LC MS MS iTRAQ technology . The study was 2 not designed to reveal differences between glaucomatous and nonglaucomatous cell cultures but rather to probe the impact of TGF signaling on TM cells . Although glaucomatous and normal TM 2 cells may exhibit dif-ferences in TGF signaling yet to be identified , all TGF -altered proteins in 2 this study were derived from both TM donor 2 populations and definitively demonstrate common conse-quences of TGF signaling in normal and glaucomatous TM cells . Most of the 853 2 quantified proteins 90 % were present in similar amounts in TGF -treated and untreated cells , indi-cating that the determined 2 proteome largely reflects that of untreated TM cells . TGF treatment significantly altered the abundance of 47 proteins 2 independent data from Western blot analysis and 2D-PAGE corroborated eight or more 17 % of these TGF -induced proteomic changes . Bioinformatic analy-sis suggested 2 that major biological processes associated with the quantified proteins Fig. 3 include cellular metabolism 28 % of the 853 proteins , signal transduction 8 % , cell structure motility 8 % , immunity and defense 5 % . and cell adhesion 2 % . Biological analysis and interpretation Inge-nuity Pathway Analysis [ IPA ] Ingenuity of these proteins im-plicated gene expression and cellular assembly and organiza-tion as the highest scoring networks . Thirty TM proteins were significantly increased in abundance after TGF treatment Table 2 , supporting the upregulated expression 2 of these polypeptides . Analysis IPA Ingenuity of the 30 elevated proteins suggested that TGF impacted two major networks , one involving amino acid metabolism , 2 post-translational modification , and small molecule biochemistry and the other involving gene expression , cellular compromise , and development . Seven of the elevated proteins or their transcripts were previously reported to be upregulated by TGF the other 23 elevated proteins provide an expanded profile 2 of TGF signaling in TM cells . Though yet uncon-firmed , calcification 2 and mineralization of the TM have been hypothesized to contribute to elevated IOP in glaucoma , 38 and 30 % of the elevated proteins bind either calcium or zinc , as noted in Table 2 . Consistent with previous reports , 6,7,20,21 10 elevated proteins are involved in the structure and regulation of the ECM , and eight of these were increased more than twofold . SPARC , elevated more than sixfold , is a matricellular protein that binds multiple proteins and cell membranes and that has been hypothesized to contribute to elevated IOP in POAG in part because SPARC-null mice exhibit lower IOPs than wild-type controls.39 The SPARC gene , highly expressed in nonglaucomatous TM , 40 has also been reported to be up-regulated by mechanical stretching.41 CTGF , a mediator of the effects of TGF s on ECM remodeling , and thrombospondin-1 , a major activator of latent TGF s and elevated in the TM of some POAG patients , 42 were both found significantly elevated . Also elevated in this study were insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 7 , which stimulates cell adhesion and mesen-cephalic astrocyte-derived neurotrophic factor also known as Protein ARMET , which binds unfolded proteins and inhibits stress-induced cell death . In addition , levels of collagen 1 type III and several other proteins that modify collagen or collagen deposition in the ECM—namely procollagen-lysine 2-oxoglutu-rate 5-dioxygenase 2 , prolyl 4-hydroxylase 2 and 1 , and collagen triple helix repeat-containing protein 1—were ele-vated . Previous studies suggest that the TM cytoskeleton is in-volved in regulating AH outflow and IOP , perhaps in part through the formation of cross-linked actin networks CLANs .9,10,43 CLANs are morphologically diverse structures in TM cells , appearing as tangles to geodesic dome-like , and observed in both normal and glaucomatous TM in vivo.43 In this study , TGF induced apparent increased expression of the actin-binding 2 proteins caldesmon , palladin , tensin-1 , and transgelin-2 , and cytoskeletal regulators like myosin regulatory light chain 9 and its binding partner protein canopy homolog 2 . Altered expression of these proteins could promote CLAN formation and impact TM cell shape , motility , proliferation , contractile and tone properties , and cell-cell and cell-ECM interactions . Six proteins increased in abundance by TGF were asso-ciated with protein folding and chaperone activities , 2 with -crystallin B the most significantly elevated 3-fold . Others in this group included thioredoxin domain-containing protein 5 , hypoxia upregulated protein 1 , FK506-binding protein 10 also known as peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase FKBP10 , 78 kDa glucose-regulated protein , and protein disulfide-isomerase A6 . Overall , about twice as many proteins were elevated than decreased by TGF treatment , and the increased abundance of chaperones and 2 folding proteins appear to be a stress re-sponse to metabolic changes , such as in protein synthesis and oxidation reduction . A variety of regulatory proteins were elevated 40 % to 70 % after TGF treatment . The possibility that TGF alters trans-2 2 lational elongation is suggested by elevated levels of ribosome-binding protein 1 , 40S ribosomal protein S25 , and elongation factor 1 . TGF -altered transcriptional regulation is also sug-2 gested by elevated levels of PDZ and LIM domain protein 4 and four and a half LIM domain protein 2 , which bind zinc and a zinc finger binding protein . Also elevated were two steroid-binding proteins , membrane-associated progesterone receptor components 1 and 2 , suggesting the possibility that TGF may play a role in steroid responsiveness in glucocorticoid-stimu-2 lated secondary glaucoma.44 Mitochondrial glutaminase , an enzyme catalyzing the conversion of glutamine to glutamate , was elevated more than 40 % after TGF treatment notably , increased glutaminase activity in the rat 2 retina has been asso-ciated with ocular hypertension.45 Seven other mitochondrial proteins were altered by TGF treatment , as discussed . 2 The levels of 17 TM proteins were significantly reduced after TGF treatment Table 3 , implying downregulated expres-2 sion , possible degradation , or both . Little is known about TGF -downregulated processes in the TM . The highest scor-ing network 2 from pathway analysis IPA Ingenuity of the 17 decreased proteins concerns developmental disorders , renal and urological diseases , and gene expression . TGF lowered the abundance of four cytoskeletal components by 2 30 % to 40 % , including the actin-binding proteins profilin-1 , coronin-1C , and myosin-1c and microtubule component tubulin -2C . As noted , altered ratios of cytoskeletal proteins could promote the formation of CLANs and adversely impact TM cell proper-ties and processes.43 In addition to cytoskeletal proteins , a variety of regulatory proteins were decreased by 30 % to 60 % . CD9 antigen , a membrane protein involved in cell adhesion and motility , was the most significantly reduced 60 % . De-creased amounts of 60S ribosomal protein L3 and histone H3.2 implicate TGF -altered translational elongation and transcrip-tion , respectively 2 all these processes are also potentially al-tered by other proteins elevated by TGF treatment , as dis-cussed . Altered GTPase and ATPase activities 2 are implied by TGF -decreased levels of guanine nucleotide-binding protein Gi 2 2 and synaptic vesicle membrane protein VAT-1 homolog , respectively . Reduction of HLA class 1 histocompatability an-tigen A68 and CD9 antigen suggests TGF -altered immune responses in TM cells , as has been proposed 2 in POAG for retinal glial cells and the optic nerve head.46 Mitochondrial Dysfunction in the TM In addition to elevated mitochondrial glutaminase , seven other mitochondrial proteins were significantly reduced by TGF treatment Table 3 . These decreased proteins serve important 2 roles in energy production e.g. , ATP synthases , transmem-brane transport e.g. , voltage-dependent anion channel pro-teins , and oxidation reduction e.g. , glutamate dehydrogenase 1 [ GLUD1 ] and SOD2 , and their decreased levels could se-verely impair cellular functions . Mitochondrial dysfunction in retinal ganglion cells has long been associated with glau-coma.47,48 However , it is only recently that evidence suggests that elevated reactive oxygen species and impaired calcium regulation in TM cell mitochondria and TM mitochondrial DNA deletions may play a role in POAG.49–51 The identification of eight mitochondrial proteins altered in abundance by TGF adds strong support to the hypothesis that mitochondrial dys-2 function in the TM contributes to POAG . For example , TGF has been reported to induce senescence in the TM , 23 and 2 elevated IOP has been reported to contribute to glutamate toxicity in the rat retina by increasing glutaminase activity and reducing glutamate uptake .45 We found mitochondrial glutam-inase elevated by 43 % and mitochondrial GLUD1 decreased by 40 % in TM cells after TGF treatment . GLUD1 reduces the amount of glutamate by catalyzing 2 its oxidation to 2-oxo-glutarate . TGF may induce TM senescence and cell death through mitochondrial 2 dysfunction that in part promotes glu-tamate imbalance . Elevated IOP has also been reported to decrease total SOD activity in the rat retina , 52 and we observed 46 % reduction in mitochondrial SOD2 in TM cells after TGF treatment . Previous work has shown that 50 % knock-down 2 of mitochondrial SOD2 in mouse retinal pigment epithe-lium correlates with increased levels of oxidative protein mod-ifications53 and that TGF increases lipid peroxidation in human TM cells.23 We and others 2 Bhattacharya SK , et al . IOVS . 2004 45 ARVO E-Abstract 4560 54 have also observed in-creased levels of oxidative protein modifications in trabeculec-tomy tissues from POAG patients . Accordingly , the present data support the hypothesis that elevated IOP in POAG is due in part to TGF -induced mitochondrial dysfunction in the TM , with concomitant 2 oxidative damage in the AH outflow path-way . Comparison with Other Studies of TGF -Induced Changes in TM Protein and Gene Expression This is the most extensive quantitative proteomic analysis to date of changes in human TM cells in response to TGF . The only other global proteomic study of TGF 2 -treated TM cells used peptide mass fingerprinting for protein 2 identification and 2D gel staining intensity for protein quantification.27 Of the 56 proteins reported in the previous study , we detected 42 and obtained reliable quantitation i.e. , proteins found in three or more TM samples for 12 of the 24 proteins reported to exhibit a significant change in 2D gel spot intensity.27 For these 12 proteins , two to three exhibited changes in agreement with the present results , namely increased amounts of transgelin-2 , -crystallin B , and possibly 78 kDa glucose-regulated protein which was reported as 1 of 2 proteins in a gel spot .27 Comparison of these proteomic studies is complicated by the different methods used , including the analysis of pooled rather than individual donor TM samples and a lower concentration of TGF for treating TM cells in the earlier study . Comparison of the present 2 results with gene expression studies of TGF -2 treated TM cells21,27,28 reveals limited correlation , however only 20 % correlation generally exists between transcript and cognate protein levels in mammals.55 From microarray studies , more than 20 transcripts have been reported to be differen-tially expressed by TGF in human TM cells.21,27,28 Significant proteomic changes in this study are consistent with reported TGF upregulation of transcripts for thrombospondin 1,21,27 2 SPARC , 23 and prolyl 4 hydroxylase subunit alpha 2.28 Proteases and protease inhibitors function in ECM remodeling in normal TM , 56 and TGF has been reported to upregulate the expres - sion of the inactive proform of matrix metalloproteinase-257 and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 in TM cells.21,35,57 Sur-prisingly , few proteases or protease inhibitors were among the 853 proteins quantified in this study , perhaps because they were below detection limits . Nevertheless , we found almost twice as many proteins increased rather than decreased in abundance , suggesting that TGF signaling may inhibit pro-teolytic processes in the TM.57 2 Several proteins previously reported to modify or to be associated with TGF signaling in the TM or to be overexpressed in POAG TM , including 2 bone morphogenetic protein family members gremlin , Smad 7 , and tissue transglutaminase and the lysyl oxidase family of en-zymes , were not detected in this study.28,35,58–60 Again , these proteins may be below the detection limits of this study . In addition , no known glaucoma susceptibility gene products were detected . We did detect two proteins reportedly upregu-lated in TM by TGF , namely senescence-associated -- galac - tosidase23 and fibronectin , 21,35 but the abundance of these proteins was not significantly different between TGF -treated 2 and untreated cells . Other TGF -regulated proteins certainly 2 exist in the TM , and some may be among those Supplementary Table S5 , http www.iovs.org lookup suppl doi 10.1167 iovs.11-8218 -DCSupplemental that narrowly miss the crite-ria used for a significant change in this study . The mechanism or mechanisms responsible for elevated expression of TGF in glaucoma patients are unknown . TGF in the aqueous 2 humor could be made and secreted from one or more tissues surrounding the anterior segment , includ-ing the ciliary epithelium , iris , lens epithelium , corneal endo-thelium , and TM . Elevated levels of TGF in glaucomatous TM tissues could be derived in part from the aqueous humor and bound to the TM extracellular matrix.19 However , glaucoma-tous TM cells express a latent isoform of TGF of higher molecular weight that must be activated to become 2 biologi-cally active.19 How latent TGF is activated in TM cells re - mains unclear but may involve thrombospondin-1,42 which was found elevated in this study . In summary , the present results add strong support to evidence that TGF can induce ECM remodeling and alter cytoskeletal interactions 2 in the TM . In addition , the results implicate TGF -altered regulation in processes such as tran-scription , translation , 2 steroid metabolism , and the glutamate glutamine cycle . Finally , the data provide new evidence that TGF -- induces mitochondrial dysfunction in the TM that could 2 contribute to oxidative damage in the AH outflow path-way , TM senescence , and ocular hypertension in POAG . Over-all , the results expand the repertoire of proteins known to participate in TGF signaling and establish a quantitative pro-teomic database for 2 the TM that includes candidate glaucoma biomarkers for future validation studies .

To evaluate mRNA levels of the ocular mucins MUC1 , MUC2 , MUC4 , MUC5AC , and MUC7 in conjunctival impres-sion cytology samples from patients with moderate to severe dry eye syndrome DES compared with a population of healthy subjects and to investigate the use of the levels of these mucin genes as biomarkers of DES and subsequently as a potential diagnostic test for DES . METHODS . This prospective study commenced in the year 2000 and ended in the year 2009 . Thirty-eight patients with DES and 43 age-and sex-matched healthy subjects completed the initial part of the study . Investigations were repeated at a later stage in 16 healthy subjects and 30 patients with DES , which were used as external validation data . Conjunctival impression cytol-ogy was performed in all subjects to test gene expression of ocular mucin genes MUC1 , MUC2 , MUC4 , MUC5AC , and MUC7 . Statistical analysis was performed to determine whether there was a difference in the levels of mucin gene expression between the two groups of subjects . Sensitivity and specificity of mucin gene expression for the diagnosis of DES was calculated . RESULTS . Expressions of MUC1 , MUC2 , MUC4 , and MUC5AC P 0.0001 were significantly lower in conjunctival epithe-lium of patients with DES compared with that in normal sub-jects . These results were replicated in the external control subject and patient groups . MUC1 expression levels demon-strated the greatest sensitivity 83.3 % and specificity 87.5 % among all genes tested . CONCLUSIONS . The data strongly suggest that the expression levels of MUC1 may be used as a diagnostic test in DES for investigational and selective clinical trials . Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci . 2011 52 8363–8369 DOI 10.1167 iovs.11-7655 Dmultifactorial ry eye syndrome DES has recently been redefined as “a disease of the tears and ocular surface that disease of the tears and ocular surface that results in symptoms of discomfort , visual disturbance , and tear film instability with potential damage to the ocular surface . Dry eye is accompanied by increased osmolarity of the tear film and inflammation of the ocular surface.”1 It is a disease frequently observed among ophthalmic patients , prevailing in approxi-mately 7–25 % of the population.2–5 Based on severity , DES can cause symptoms from simple ocular irritation to blindness.6 Although there are several clinical tests available for the diag-nosis of DES , no single test can accurately differentiate a pa-tient with DES from a healthy subject , and thus a battery of tests is routinely used.6–8 One recent study in the Spanish population similar to the participants of this present study also demonstrated no correlation between subjective dry eye questionnaires and objective clinical testing.9 For this reason , investigative studies or clinical trials performed on DES often resort to using multiple tests for the diagnosis of the DES study group , which increase the time course of patient visits during the study period , preventing subjects from having a uniform evaluation endpoint.6,10,11 Mucins are high molecular weight proteins , with tandem repetitions in the central position of the protein.12 The ocular surface expresses at least 9 of the 18 human mucin genes Disclosure R.M.

MUC1 , MUC2 , MUC4 , MUC5AC , MUC7 , MUC13 , MUC15 , MUC16 , and MUC17.13–24 Mucins keep the ocular surface wet and protected from adverse environmental conditions . Based on their amino acid sequences , mucins are categorized in three distinct families gel forming MUC2 , MUC5AC , MUC5B , MUC6 , and MUC19 , soluble MUC7 and MUC9 , and trans-membrane MUC1 , MUC3A , MUC3B , MUC4 , MUC12 , MUC13 , MUC15 , MUC16 , MUC17 , MUC20 , and MUC21 other mucins remain unclassified MUC8 and MUC11 . There is some evidence that DES leads to an alteration in ocular mucins.23,25–33 A previous study showed that the mucin MUC5AC transcripts in the conjunctival epithelium of patients with DES associated with Sjo ¨gren syndrome were significantly lower than those in normal individuals , and no significant changes in the expression of MUC1 and MUC4.23 One recent study showed that patients with Sjo ¨gren’s syndrome dry eye expressed greater amounts of soluble MUC-1 protein and mRNA in the tear fluid and conjunctiva compared with patients with non-Sjo ¨gren’s dry eye and healthy controls.29 They also demonstrated that MUC4 correlated well with clinical findings such as lid-parallel conjunctival folds and lid-wiper epitheliopa-thy.29 In a separate study , Caffery et al.30 also noted increased mRNA and protein levels of MUC16 in conjunctival and tear fluid samples . Berry et al.31 demonstrated that MUC5AC levels were significantly decreased in patients with DES . One recent study reported that the frequency of patients with non-Sjo ¨gren’s aqueous-deficient dry eye , expressing only the MUC1 A splice variant of the mucin MUC1 in conjunctival samples , was lower than that of a normal control group.32 Furthermore , another study from the same group33 showed genotypic differences in MUC-1 expression between DES and healthy patients that could promote the ocular surface damage observed in patients . MUC-1 expression has also shown to be variable in diseased human corneas compared with that of healthy corneas.34 MUC16 and MUC5AC were correlated with corneal staining levels.31 The above-mentioned previous stud-ies suggest that mucin expression levels not only correlate well with DES clinical findings but can also be an important distin-guishing feature between patients with DES and healthy sub-jects . Conjunctival impression cytology CIC is a well-estab-lished , noninvasive method to obtain epithelial cells from the ocular surface in normal and pathologic conditions.13,17,21– 24,35–46 The collected cells may be used in many different ways , including the detection of mRNA levels of ocular mucin genes in healthy individuals.13,17,21–24,35 This study was designed to evaluate mRNA levels of the ocular mucins MUC1 , MUC2 , MUC4 , MUC5AC , and MUC7 in CIC samples from patients with moderate to severe tear-defi-cient DES compared with those from a population of healthy subjects . The data from this study will identify the potential use of mucin gene levels as important biomarkers for the diagnosis of DES . METHODS Selection of Patients and Normal Donors Conjunctival Epithelial Cell Collection by CIC RNA Isolation and Reverse Transcription Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction Mucin Level Healthy Donors DES Patients P Value Mucin Level Measurements Reference Intervals Classification Models RESULTS Reference Intervals All conjunctival samples offered adequate material to proceed with the planned assays . MUC1 , MUC2 , MUC4 , MUC5AC , and MUC7 mucin transcripts were detected in all healthy donor samples of G1 n 43 and in the most of the patients with DES n 38 . The relative quantitation of mucin gene expres-sion could be performed because the slope of the standard curve for each gene showed similar efficiencies of amplifica-tion . The data had a normal distribution after the logarithmic transformation . The negative logarithmic values for normal Mucin Level Value 90 % CI Value 90 % CI mucin gene expression ranged from 0.65 MUC1 and MUC4 to 2.56 MUC2 relative to GAPDH expression . The negative logarithmic values for patient samples ranged from 1.5 MUC7 to 4.9 MUC2 . Expressions of MUC1 , MUC2 , MUC4 , and MUC5AC were significantly lower in the DES samples Table 1 than those in healthy donor samples . We used this data set as a reference sample to determine reference intervals . The aver-age age in this group of 43 subjects was 61.14 2.31 years range 20–84 years . In this group , 44.3 % 19 43 were fe-males with a mean age of 60.63 3.80 years range 26–84 years years . Although the mean age of the males was slightly higher 61.54 2.91 range 20 to 79 years , it was not statis-tically significant Student’s t-test P value 0.8475 . The 95 % reference interval for each mucin level and the 90 % CIs around each reference limit are given in Table 2 . To validate the reference intervals we considered two data sets of observed values , G2 and G3 . These data were collected follow-ing the same procedures for the reference sample . Table 3 shows the classification of observed values into one of two reference interval classes . There was a statistically significant inverse relationship for MUC2 OR 0.0805 95 % CI 0.0072 , 0.8949 but not for MUC5AC levels 2 P value 0.2699 . MUC2 , MUC5AC , and MUC7 levels demonstrated an inverse relationship , with more frequent unusual values occurring in the healthy subjects OR 1 . MUC1 levels had the most significant direct association OR 49.2857 95 % CI 5.4942 , 442.1152 , with more frequent unusual values occurring in the Classification Models The three classification models constructed using the mucin levels in the G1 data set as explanatory variables had SE and SP values 80 % M1 MUC1 SE SP 100 % M2 MUC4 SE 95.10 % , SP 95.30 and M3 MUC2 MUC5AC SE 83.70 % , SP 91.10 % . Additional model validation was performed with the G2 and G3 data sets . The results of this validation are given in Table 5 . The AUC was not statistically different from 0.5 in M3 AUC 0.640 P value 0.190 . In addition , pAUC with an 80 % to SP was zero . M1 was the best classificatory model Fig. 2 . Al - TABLE 4 .

The summary of the atypicality index for each mucin level is shown in Table 4 . In general , the index values were larger and higher for mucin levels in patients with DES . The lower value was the MUC1 level in the healthy subject sample an approximately 60 % chance that the ob-served profile came from the reference population . The higher value was MUC1 in the DES subject sample an approximately 93 % chance that the observer profile did not come from the reference population . though it seemed to be slightly worse than M2 to classify healthy subjects M1 SP 87.5 % vs. M2 SP 93.8 % , this difference was not statistically significant M1 95 % CI SP 64 % , 96.5 % vs. M2 95 % CI SP 71.7 % , 98.9 % . DISCUSSION Our study has clearly demonstrated that levels of MUC1 ex-pression in superior bulbar conjunctival cells are significantly lower in patients with aqueous-deficient DES compared with that in healthy patients . We have also shown that expressions of MUC2 , MUC4 , and MUC5AC are lower in these patients with DES . The implications of these results are discussed in the following text . As mentioned earlier , DES is a common clinical condition causing ocular irritation that is diagnosed and treated by eye-care practitioners around the world . The common nature of prevalence of DES in the population , lack of objective and subjective correlation , and the lack of a “cure” has prompted several basic-science and clinical investigations into the nature of this disease . Clinical dry eye tests face problems such as varying sensitivities and specificities , lack of consensus on cutoff values , poor reproducibility , and poor correlation with subjective signs.6,8,54 This is similar to other diseases with tests of self-perception such as cataract55 and benign prostate hy-pertrophy , 56 where the symptoms experienced by the patient demonstrated a low correlation to the objective findings . The goal of the present study was to investigate if studying gene expression levels of certain ocular surface mucins will help diagnose patients with dry eye more accurately . Mucins play a major role in maintaining ocular surface health.57 The clinical relevance of mucins is evident from the facts that the expres-sions of mucins MUC1 , MUC5A , MUC16 , and MUC19 are altered in evaporative DES , contact lens wearers and ocular allergy , and non-Sjo ¨gren’s DES and autoimmune DES , respec-tively.23,28–31,58 Interestingly , a recent study found an increase of soluble MUC1 in Sjo ¨gren’s DES and non-Sjo ¨gren’s DES compared with that in healthy patients.29 They showed MUC1 mRNA expres-sion to be similar in non-Sjo ¨gren’s DES and healthy patients , whereas membrane-bound MUC1 expression was different only between the Sjo ¨gren’s DES and healthy patients.29 Our study found decreased conjunctival MUC1 mRNA expression in non-Sjo ¨gren’s DES compared with that in healthy subjects . The participants with DES in our study are comparable with respect to the disease to the patients with non-Sjo ¨gren’s DES in the earlier study.29 The difference in results for MUC1 expression between our study and the previous study29 could be attributed to several factors . The previous study29 pooled the conjunctival impression cytology samples from different patients , whereas we analyzed individual samples on each patient . Pooling impression cytology samples may mask the variability between individual patients . Some recent stud-ies32,33 suggest conjunctival MUC1 polymorphism , in the vari-able number of tandem repeats VNTR region , which is the region that elaborates the soluble form of MUC1 . Patients with dry eye syndrome demonstrate different genotypes in this region compared with that in healthy patients . In our present study , we designed our probes to be far away from the VNTR region to amplify the transmembrane part of conjunctival MUC1 . A different primer between our present study and that in the previous study29 can be one factor in the difference in results . In our present study , experiments were performed at two different periods of time years 2000 and 2009 , demon-strating that our results are consistent and repeatable over time . One previous study also demonstrated results similar to ours.32 The level of expression of mucins whether decreased or increased as a clinical marker for DES has been studied , thus appearing to be the next logical step in the quest to identify a gold standard for the diagnosis of this multifactorial disease . The membrane-associated mucins such as MUC1 play a major role in lubrication , apical surface barrier , and osmosens-ing.29,57–59 Previously it has been shown that the frequency of patients with non-Sjo ¨gren’s aqueous-deficient DES , expressing only the MUC1 A splice variant of the mucin MUC1 , may be lower than that of a normal control group.32 Thus , a longer repeat sequence of amino acids on MUC1 variants may play a role in susceptibility to DES.32 Differences in MUC1 genotype can explain loss of ocular surface integrity that is often ob-served in patients with DES.60 A recent study61 demonstrated that molecules such as neutrophil elastase and tumor necrosis factor-alpha TNF-induce the release of membrane-associated mucins MUC1 , MUC4 , and MUC16 in human corneal–limbal epithelial cells . Similar release of membrane-associated mucins can be induced in patients with DES who often demonstrate increased levels of inflammatory cyto-kines such as TNF-and other inflammatory cytokines.62 The release of these mucins from the corneal epithelial surface can lead to loss of integrity of the ocular surface in DES evidenced in clinical practice as vital dye positive staining . Therefore , a decrease in MUC1 expression not only indicates increased risk for DES but also appears to be diagnostic for the disease . The present study seems to be the first one to propose using MUC1 expression levels as a diagnostic marker for diagnosis of dry eye syndrome . The validity of our study is greatly increased by using external data sets . Internal validation of prediction models may not be sufficient and indicative for the model’s performance in future patients because the classifiers tend to perform better on data on which the model was constructed than on new data . Accordingly , external validation is essential before implementing prediction models in clinical practice . The MUC1 expression level has been shown to be the best predictor with our validation sets . Therefore , from the data proposed in this study , it appears that expression levels of the MUC1 gene can form a major diagnostic aid for DES . Although measuring MUC1 expression is a laboratory procedure , it can still be widely used in inves-tigational studies where patients are monitored while on ther-apy for DES over a period . It is well known that having a good test to clinically diagnose DES is essential for ophthalmic phy-sicians as well as scientists conducting drug trials or clinical trials in DES . Based on the data presented in this present study we foresee that MUC1 gene expression levels will be used as a successful diagnostic biomarker to accurately distinguish pa-tients with DES from normal , healthy subjects in the near future . This study did not investigate ocular mucin expression in other ocular surface diseases and thus we can not state at this time whether these findings would be widespread and seen in other ocular surface conditions . These studies are therefore warranted . In the present study , although the level of expression of MUC4 was second best compared with MUC1 in identifying patients with DES , the MUC4 model was the best to classify healthy patients . A recent study demonstrated that levels of MUC4 correlated well with temporal lid-parallel conjunctival folds and lid-wiper epitheliopathy , which are clinical signs observed in patients with DES.31 It has been suggested that MUC4 levels are increased in ocular allergies as an ocular surface defense mechanism to compensate the loss of other mucins at the ocular surface.63 Thus it can be hypothesized that a decrease in MUC4 levels can challenge the integrity of the ocular surface . The present study is novel in nature due to the fact that we have compared the expression of several different con-junctival mucins in DES and healthy patients and repeated the experiments at two different periods in time , separated years apart . The data appear consistent over time and can be used for external validation . In summary , our data have dem-onstrated that MUC1 levels can be used to detect patients with DES with very high accuracy . Thus , we propose the use of MUC1 levels as a diagnostic marker for DES since this will not only increase the accuracy of classifying patients correctly , but also significantly aid in clinical trials for the development of therapeu-tic agents for this prevalent ocular disease .

Tau comprises a family of six proteins from a single gene by alternative mRNA splicing Goedert et al. , 1989 Himmler et al. , 1989 . Splicing in the microtubule binding region the repeat inter-repeat region leads to either the presence or absence of a 31-amino acid sequence that contains the first inter - repeat “R1–R2 IR” and repeat 2 , thereby generating 4-repeat 4R and 3-repeat 3R Tau , respectively Goode et al. , 2000 . In AD , all six isoforms are hyper-phosphorylated in paired helical filaments PHFs , which form neurofibrillary tangles NFTs Grundke-Iqbal et al. , 1986 Grundke-Iqbal et al. , 1989 . Hyper-phosphorylation of Tau precedes the appearance of NFTs Bancher et al. , 1989 Kopke et al. , 1993 , and deposition of A ? 42 initiates the molecular mecha-nism in AD Younkin , 1995 and gene transfer models Rebeck et al. , 2010 . Tau mutations cause FTDP-17 Hutton et al. , 1998 , and particular variants are associated with increased risk for other Parkinsonian dis-orders including PSP Baker et al. , 1999 and CBD Di Maria et al. , 2000 . The FTDP-related P301L TauP301L exhibits accelerated fila-ment formation in vitro Nacharaju et al. , 1999 and TauP301L trans-genic mice develop NFTs Lewis et al. , 2000 . Genetic variants of Tau may also be risk factors for Parkinson s disease PD Healy et al. , 2004 Martin et al. , 2001 . Idiopathic PD is not associated with NFTs , but Tau expression was demonstrated in a sub-population of LBs Ishizawa et al. , 2003 . While the primary Tauopathies and PD have distinctive clinical features , significant overlap exists , particularly manifest in the variable appearances of dementia and Parkinsonism Klein et al. , 2006 . Inflammation is a common secondary denominator in neurodegen-erative diseases . Neuronal loss with gliosis and NFTs are prominent pathological findings in several brain regions in PSP Hanihara et al. , 1995 Hof et al. , 1992 Ito et al. , 2008 . Filamentous Tau inclusions , ex-tensive neuronal loss and gliosis , are pathological hallmarks of many neurodegenerative diseases Lee et al. , 2001 . Gliosis is also well estab-lished in AD Iwatsubo et al. , 1994 Nishimura et al. , 1995 . Inclusions formed by ? -Synuclein in Multiple System Atrophy MSA can also occur with Tau pathology Chin and Goldman , 1996 Tu et al. , 1995 . Despite these pathological correlations between Tau and ? -Synuclein inclusions , there is no known mechanistic connection between them . In these studies we used lentiviral gene transfer animal models to test the effects of Tauwt and TauP301Lin vivo . We compared the effects of Tauwt and TauP301L on Tau modification , protein phosphorylation , kinase activity and neuro-inflammation . We also tested the effects of Tauwt and TauP301L expression on the endogenous levels and post-translational modification of other pathogenic proteins , includ-ing ? -Synuclein , ? APP and TDP-43 , which are involved in the major-ity of neurodegenrative diseases . Results Distribution of lentiviral Tau expression in rat motor cortex We cloned 4R human Tauwt and TauP301L into pLenti6 lentiviral vector Fig. 1A using TOPO cloning according to manufacturer s in-structions Invitrogen . To determine the distribution of Tau expres-sion using lentiviral gene delivery into the rat primary motor cortex we coronally sectioned the brain and stained serial sections with a specific anti-Thr 231 AT180 Tau antibody to determine gene expres-sion . Gene delivery into the rat motor cortex led to detection of im-munoreactivity to Tau epitope AT180 in the soma and fibers of deep cortical neurons in Tauwt Fig. 1B and TauP301L Fig. 1C around the point of injection . Higher magnification insets Figs . 1B and C shows Tau accumulation in neuronal processes , suggesting the pres-ence of neurofilaments in the fibers of Tau-expressing neurons . Tau immunoreactivity was also observed in pyramidal neurons in the motor cortex approximately 2.4 mm away from the point of injection with Tauwt Fig. 1D or TauP310L Fig. 1E . AT180 staining of cortical sections 3.5 mm away from the point of injection with either Tauwt Fig. 1F or TauP301L Fig. 1G were not different from cortical sections in the contralateral motor cortex injected with lentiviral LacZ Figs . 1H and I . These data demonstrate that lentiviral injection results in Tau expression within a radius of 2.4 mm from the point of injection . Lentiviral expression of Tauwt and TauP301L has differential effects on the phosphorylation and aggregation of Tau in vivo We injected lentiviral clones into the rat primary motor cortex to mimic advanced stages of human Tau pathology in association and primary areas of the neocortex Braak et al. , 2006 . The motor cortex was dissected 4 weeks post-injection and analyzed by WB using a number of Tau epitopes . Total Tau values are adjusted to actin levels and phospho-Tau results are expressed as phosphorylated Tau to total Tau ratio . Densitomertic measurement of the 60KD band revealed that Tauwt caused a significant 51 % increase in total Tau levels Figs . 2Aand C compared to LacZ injected cortex . We also ob-served an increase in Tau isoforms multiple bands in Tauwt injected animals compared to LacZ , suggesting that Tauwt alters the processing of Tau . The increase in total Tau levels was also associated with a sig-nificant increase in phoshorylated Tau at Ser 199 202 AT8 , 38 % , Thr 231 AT180 , 35 % , Ser 396 68 % compared to LacZ injected brains Figs . 2A , B and C . No significant differences were observed at Ser 262 or Thr 181 AT270 phosphorylation sites between Tauwt and LacZ injected brains Figs . 2B and C . TauP301L injection revealed a sig-nificant increase 62 % in total Tau levels Figs . 1D and G , as shown by densitometry of the 60 kD band , and resulted in the appearance of a protein smear at higher molecular weight , suggesting that TauP301L increases the aggregation of Tau . To ascertain that the pro-tein smear is due to Tau aggregation we probed with total human Tau HT7 antibody and detected the 60KDa band in LacZ injected an-imals Fig. 2E and obvious increases in protein levels and high mo-lecular weight smear were detected in TauP301L and human AD brain extracts compared to Tauwt and human control , suggesting pro-tein aggregation . The detection of human Tau in LacZ injected ani-mals , suggests leakage of lentiviral Tau into the contralateral side . Phosphorylation of all measured isoforms of Tau , including Ser 199 202 AT8 , 58 % , Thr 231 AT180 , 51 % , Ser 396 71 % , Thr 181 AT270 , 52 % Ser 262 42 % was significantly increased compared to LacZ injected brains Figs . 2D , F and G . Further analysis showed that TauP301L injected brains had significantly higher Pb0.05 levels of phosphorylated Thr 181 AT270 and Ser 262 compared to Tauwt injected animals Figs . 2F and G . Thus , while Tauwt and TauP301L were expressed at similar levels , TauP301L was associated with more Tau phosphorylation and aggregation in vivo . To determine whether hyper-phosphorylation of Tau results in accumulation of intracellular amyloidogenic proteins , we stained brain sections with thioflavin-S and observed increased levels of thioflavin-S positive neurons in Tauwt Fig. 2I and TauP301L Fig. 2J compared to LacZ Fig. 2H injected animals . Lentiviral Tau expression alters kinase and phosphatase activities The increase in the levels of phosphorylated Tau led us to examine the activity of some Tau kinases . WB analysis showed a significant Pb0.05 increase 157 % in activated GSK-3 in Tauwt expressing cortex Figs . 3Aand B compared to LacZ control . We examined whether Tau expression led to activation of other kinases . No significant changes were observed in the levels of casein kinase-1 CK1 between Tauwt and LacZ injected brains Fig. 3A . However , a significant Pb0.05 in-crease 54 % was observed in the levels of polo-like kinase 2 PLK2 in Tauwt Figs . 3A and B compared to LacZ injected brains . WB analysis of cortical lysates expressing TauP301L showed a similar increase 145 % in GSK-3 levels Figs . 3C and D compared to LacZ injected brains . No differences were observed in CK1 levels but TauP301L expres-sion was associated with a significant increase 62 % in PLK2 levels compared to LacZ injected Figs . 3C and D brains . We also examined the role of Tau in inducing protein phosphatase activity . No significant differences were observed by WB analysis of phosphatase-2A PP2A subunits A , B and C levels Fig. 3E between Tauwt and LacZ injected brains . However , despite unchanged levels in PP2A substrates , total protein phosphatase activity in cortical brain lysates was significantly decreased 17 % in Tauwt Fig. 3F compared to LacZ injected animals . Similarly , TauP301L expression did not change the levels of PP2A subunits A , B and C Fig. 3G but sig-nificantly 19 % decreased protein phosphatase activity in TauP301L Fig. 3F compared to LacZ injected animals . These data suggest that Tauwt and TauP301L similarly alter kinase and phosphatase activities . TauP301L and Tauwt differentially increase microglial activation and levels of Interleukin-6 and TNF- ? in vivo To test whether Tau expression in our gene transfer animal models led to inflammatory changes , we stained cortical brain slices with the astrocytic marker GFAP and microglial marker IBA-1 . We also performed interleukin-6 IL-6 ELISA and WB analysis of TNF- ? . Immunohistochemistry did not reveal any changes in the morpholo-gy or number of GFAP stained cells in Tauwt Figs . 4Band C and LacZ Figs . 4A and C injected cortex . Tauwt expression significantly increased 34 % the number of microglia Figs . 4E and C compared to LacZ injected brains Figs . 4D and C , indicative of an inflammatory reaction . No changes in GFAP stained cells were observed in TauP301L Figs . 4G and H and LacZ Figs . 4F and H injected cortex . However , TauP301L expression revealed morphological changes and significantly increased 54 % the number of microglia Figs . 4J and H compared to LacZ injected brains Figs . 4I and H . We also observed a significant increase in IL-6 levels in TauP301L 38 % compared to LacZ Fig. 4K . This increase in IL-6 led us to exam-ine other inflammatory markers . Tauwt induced a significant 48 % in-crease in TNF- ? levels Figs . 4L and M , but no significant changes in iNOS levels data not shown . TauP301L also induced a significant increase 74 % in TNF- ? levels Figs . 4N and M , but no change in iNOS levels compared to LacZ control Pb0.05 . The changes in TNF- ? levels were not significantly different between Tauwt and TauP301L expressing brains . Tau expression modifies ? -Synuclein metabolism but does not affect ? APP or TDP-43 levels To examine the effects of Tau expression on other pathogenic pro-teins known to be associated with Tau pathology in neurodegenera-tive diseases , we tested the levels of ? -Synuclein , ? APP and TDP-43 . WB of endogenous ? -Synuclein Figs . 5Aand B showed a significant increase 32 % in 17Kd ? -Synuclein levels in Tauwt compared to LacZ injected brains . We also observed an increase in the levels of higher molecular weight bands of ? -Synuclein at 49Kd and 62Kd , suggesting protein aggregation in Tauwt expressing brains . We also found a sig-nificant increase 254 % in ? -Synuclein phosphorylated at Serine-129 p-Ser129 in the presence of Tauwt . Strong bands were also observed at 49Kd , again suggesting ? -Synuclein aggregation . No significant dif-ferences were observed in endogenous ? APP Figs . 5A and B and TDP-43 Figs . 5A and B levels between Tauwt and LacZ infected brains . TauP301L also resulted in a significant increase 53 % in ? -Synuclein Figs . 5C and D and an increase in high molecular weight proteins 62Kd . A significant increase 274 % in p-Ser129 levels were observed in TauP301L expressing brains compared to LacZ , and an increase in 49Kd bands were also observed . No significant differences were detected with ? APP Figs . 5C and D or TDP-43 Figs.5C and D between TauP301L and LacZ infected brains . Tauwt was associated with a signifi-cantly higher increase in p-Ser129 levels 17Kd band compared to TauP301L expressing brains . These data indicate that Tauwt and TauP301L expression differentially increase ? -Synuclein and phosphorylated ? -Synuclein , but do not affect ? APP or TDP-43 , in these animal models . We performed independent studies using immunohistochemistry to ascertain whether lentiviral human Tau expression increases the levels of p-Ser129 in Tau gene transfer animal models . Staining cortical brain sections with p-Ser129 antibody showed increased ? -Synuclein expression in brain cells of animals injected with lentiviral Tauwt Fig. 5F or TauP301L Fig. 5G and the appearance of filamentous inclu-sions arrows compared to LacZ injected animals Fig. 5E , suggesting protein aggregation . Taken together , these data suggest alteration of ? -Synuclein phosphorylation in lentiviral Tau gene transfer animal models . Discussion In the present studies , we compared the effects of Tauwt and TauP301L using lentiviral gene delivery to over-express Tau in the rat motor cortex , in order to mimic advanced stages of human Tauopa-thies in neurodegenerative diseases Braak et al. , 2006 . We observed Tau expression in cell bodies and neuronal processes within 2.4 mm radius from the point of injection in the cortex of animals over-expressing either Tauwt or TauP301L . Lentiviral expression of Tauwt or TauP301L led to expression of both forms of Tau and the occurrence of hyper-phosphorylated Tau at several Ser and Thr residues . However , the TauP301L mutant was associated with significantly more phosphorylation at Ser 262 and Thr 181 and generation of protein smears indicative of protein aggregation , suggesting that the FTDP-related TauP301L Hutton et al. , 1998 is more aggressive on Tau mod-ification than Tauwt . Overexpression of Tauwt resulted in detection of more isoforms of Tau , suggesting that Tauwt and TauP301L differential-ly affect Tau modification . These data are consistent with recent find-ings that the level of tau species may provide information for the classification of dementias and provide biological markers to differ-entiate between these diseases . For example , in a recent review from multiple centers , Tau phosphorylated at Thr 231 AT180 differentiated between AD and FTDP , while tau phosphorylated at Ser 181 enhanced classification between AD and DLB Hampel et al. , 2010 . Moreover , Tauwt and TauP301L were also associated with the presence of intracellu-lar thioflavin-positive deposits suggesting that Tau overexpression and modification result in the formation of intracellular inclusions . Growing evidence indicate that GSK-3 is associated with risk for human primary neurodegenerative dementias , including AD and FTDP , via interaction with Tau Kwok et al. , 2008 Schaffer et al. , 2008 . In the present studies , Tau expression was associated with an increase in GSK-3 , but no significant differences were observed in GSK-3 activation between Tauwt and TauP301L , suggesting that both forms of Tau may induce GSK-3 activation , perhaps leading to increased Tau hyper-phosphorylation Cho and Johnson , 2003 , 2004 . Some reports indicate that Tau phosphorylation by cdk5 at Ser 202 AT8 and Ser 404 exhibit moderate effect on microtubule dy-namics Trinczek et al. , 1995 , while other studies suggest that phos-phorylation of Ser 202 leads to Tau detachment from microtubules Schneider et al. , 1999 . In addition , phosphorylation at Ser 262 ap-pears to reduce the interaction of Tau with microtubules Trinczek et al. , 1995 , suggesting that phosphorylation at Ser 262 would in-crease the level of Tau aggregation . Furthermore , the activities of Tau kinases may depend on protein phosphatases . Recent studies in mice harboring a mutant form of PP2A showed progressive Tau phos-phorylation at AT8 , AT180 and Ser 396 concurrent with increased GSK-3 ? and decreased cdk5 activities , suggesting that PP2A acts at ki-nases to regulate Tau phosphorylation Louis et al. , 2011 . These data are consistent with the decrease of total phosphatase activities in the present studies however , lack of changes in specific subunits of PP2A may be due to time course extraction of the samples Khandelwal et al. , 2010 . We also examined the expression levels of other kinases , including CK1 and PLK2 . We did not observe any difference in CK1 levels either when Tauwt or TauP301L were expressed , suggesting that CK1 is not altered in Tau-expressing animals . However , Tau ex-pression was associated with significantly increased levels of PLK2 , which is also associated with ? -Synuclein phosphorylation Inglis et al. , 2009 Khandelwal et al. , 2010 , suggesting that an increase in Tau levels may activate different kinases , leading to phosphorylation of Tau and perhaps other proteins , including ? -Synuclein . Tau gene transfer animal models exhibited neuro-inflammatory signs , including changes in microglial morphology associated with in-creased levels of IL-6 and TNF- ? , consistent with other studies in Tau transgenic mouse models , which show degeneration and inflammation similar to human Tauopathies Higuchi et al. , 2002 . Tau accumulation and gliosis are pathological hallmarks of neurodegenerative diseases Lee et al. , 2001 , and are particularly associated with primary Tauopa-thies , including FTDP , PSP and CBD Nishimura et al. , 1992 Yamazaki et al. , 1994 Feany and Dickson , 1995 Dickson et al. , 1996 . These data suggest that TauP301L , which is associated with a primary Tauopathy , may induce neuro-inflammatory responses that significantly differ from the secondary types of inflammation associated with protein accu-mulation , including Tau , in AD and PD . Further studies are needed to de-lineate the mechanistic effects of different Tau isoforms on microglial activation . We also tested the effects of Tau expression on the endogenous levels and post-translational modification of pathogenic proteins , in-cluding ? -Synuclein , ? APP and TDP-43 . Gene transfer of both Tauwt and TauP301L was associated with an increase in the levels of total ? -Synuclein and phospho- ? -Synuclein , and suggested aggregation of this protein in our animal models . The observed increase in ? -Synuclein phosphorylation at Ser 129 is consistent with our previous report Khandelwal et al. , 2010 and other recent findings in transgenic mice Clinton et al. , 2010 . The change in ? -Synuclein in Tau models suggests that Tau accumulation , increases the risk of ? -Synuclein accumulation and may be a risk factor associated with Synucleinopathies and Parkin-sonian disorders , including PSP Baker et al. , 1999 and CBD Di Maria et al. , 2000 . Indeed , the relationship between Tau and ? -Synuclein is compelling since Tau accumulates in LBs Ishizawa et al. , 2003 , and Tau and ? -Synuclein inclusions exist in MSA Chin and Goldman , 1996 Tu et al. , 1995 . TauP301L causes FTDP in human Hutton et al. , 1998 , and exhibits pathogenic effects in vitro Nacharaju et al. , 1999 , and transgenic mice expressing TauP301L develop NFTs Lewis et al. , 2000 . Previously , we showed an increase in Tau phosphorylation in ? -Synuclein expressinganimal models Khandelwal et al. , 2010 , there-fore , together our studies suggest that Tau and ? -Synuclein affect the levels and modification of each other . These effects may be through the regulatory systems of kinases and phosphatases . Conclusions Lentiviralexpression of Tauwt and TauP301L induce pathogenic events in gene transfer animal models , and TauP301L shows more aggressive ef-fects on Tau hyper-phosphorylation . Expression of Tauwt and TauP301L causes changes in microglial morphology and increases the levels of IL-6 and TNF- ? . Tau alters the balance between various kinases and phosphatase activities , and leads to increases in the levels of ? -Synuclein and phosphorylated ? -Synuclein . The change of ? -Synuclein in Tau gene transfer models suggests that Tau pathology may increase the risk for diseases with ? -Synuclein such as Parkinsonism . Experimental methods Cloning lentiviral constructs Human 4 repeat wild type Tau Tauwt and mutant TauP301 gene Fig. 1A were each cloned into a pLenti6-D-TOPO Invitrogen , Inc plasmid under the control of a Cytomegalovirus CMV promoter using atggctgagccccgccaggag as a forward primer and ccgaactgcgag-gagcagctg as a reverse primer Fig. 1A .

Animals were euthanized 4 weeks post-injection , and the LacZ infected hemisphere control was compared with the Tauwt or TauP301L infected hemisphere . The total number of animals injected with Tauwt was N 6 for WB , ELISA and other assays and N 4 for IHC , and the total number of animals injected with TauP301L was N 4 for WB and ELISA and N 4 for IHC . All animal experiments were conducted in full compliance with the recommendations of Georgetown University Animal Care and Use Committee GUAUC .

West-ern blots were quantified by densitometry using Quantity One 4.6.3 software Bio Rad . Densitometry was performed on individual bands by placing the same size square over the correct size bands , for example the 60 kD top band for Tau and the 17 kD band for ? -Synuclein . Addi-tional bands showing aggregation of ? -Synuclein i.e. 49 kD were also performed by placing the same size square around the bands of in-terests and converting the area into numeric data . Data from each group were analyzed as mean±StDev and statistical comparison of variables was obtained by ANOVA with Neuman–Keuls multiple comparison test , Pb0.05 .

21948645	PURPOSE . Studies have used central retinal arteriolar CRAE and central retinal venular CRVE calibers , measured from images produced with computerized image analysis , to detect risk factors for systemic diseases . The authors explored suboptimal image focus as a possible contributing factor to artificially larger vascular caliber measurements . METHODS . From the reading center image collections , 30 digital retinal images were selected for optimum quality . Image anal-ysis software was used to derive nine progressively blurred versions of the originals . IVAN measurement software was used to measure CRAE and CRVE in the original and the blurred series derived from them . To check the adequacy of the sim-ulation , progressively defocused series of images were taken of several volunteers . RESULTS . For CRAE , each level of simulated blurring produced a statically significant increase in apparent vessel caliber from the original P 0.01 , Wilcoxon signed rank test . For an average CRAE of 160 m , mean broadening with minimal moderate severe blurring was 3 m 12 m 33 m . For CRVE , every blurring level beyond the first was found to be significant P 0.01 . From an average CRVE of 200 m , mean broaden-ing ranged from 0 to 11 m with minimal to severe blurring . Analysis of the progressively defocused series taken of volun-teers yielded similar results overall . CONCLUSIONS . Suboptimal focus can result in erroneously larger vessel caliber measurements . Slight blurring has a minimal effect , but more severe blurring has a progressively greater effect . Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci . 2011 52 8558–8561 DOI 10.1167 iovs.11-7917 Ttroduced he Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study ARIC in-a computerized method of measuring and sum - a computerized method of measuring and sum-marizing retinal vascular caliber from fundus photographs.1 Several large population-based studies , including ARIC , the Beaver Dam Eye Study , 2,3 the Blue Mountain Eye study , 4 and the Wisconsin Epidemiologic Study of Diabetic Retinopathy , 5 have found abnormal retinal vascular caliber either broadened or narrowed to be associated with , or even a risk factor for , various systemic disease outcomes . Although the measurement procedure itself has been shown to be reproducible , 4 the impact of photograph quality , in particular the sharpness of camera focus , has not been sufficiently explored . We tested this question with IVAN , a semiautomated pro-gram for measuring retinal vessel diameter created at the Uni-versity of Wisconsin at Madison5–7 and now widely used by other investigators . In brief , an algorithm for segmenting ves-sels from the retinal pigment epithelium RPE divides a color image into separate homogeneous regions called splats . After-ward , a vessel-tracking module determines the margins of pre-sumed vessels based on the splat boundaries and measures their widths . Of note though color information is used to type vessels as to arterioles or venules , vessel caliber is determined from only the monochromatic green channel , which offers highest contrast of vessels against RPE . By optical principle , defocusing attenuates the highest fre-quencies in an image , artificially widening the apparent dimen-sions of features in that image compared with an optimally focused image.8 Briefly , defocusing entails a point spread func-tion in which some light rays reflected from the object of interest appear to the observer to be originating outside the actual margin of that object , in effect broadening its apparent dimensions . Thus , if a fundus photograph is taken with less than optimal focus , we might predict that the apparent vessel caliber would be artificially widened . In the case of the vessel segmentation approach used in IVAN , we might expect to see artificial expansion of the splats corresponding to vessels . Using well-focused images with established vascular mea-surement results , we used image editing software Photoshop CS3 Adobe , San Jose , CA to model progressive defocusing of the image . With the derived series of images , we measured the impact of defocusing on the retinal vascular caliber results . To check the adequacy of the simulated blurring , we also took a series of progressively defocused fundus photographs of sev-eral volunteers by graduated movement of the focus knob from the optimal setting .

Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test of Blurred Derivations versus Original Image RESULTS The series of nine progressively blurred photographs were compared with their original counterparts . The CRAE of each level of blurring showed a statically significant change in vessel caliber from the original P 0.01 , Wilcoxon signed rank test . For the CRVE , every level beyond the first was found to be significant P 0.01 . The CRVE for Blur 1 versus Original had very little change mean , 0 m SD , 2 m median , 0 m and a correspondingly high P value 0.81 . As shown in Figure 1 , the average change in CRAE caliber , through blur level 5 , is approximately double the magnitude of average change in CRVE mean , 4.3 m SD , 1.5 m . In our simulation study , it took only three levels of blurring for arterioles to exceed 5 m artificial broadening , whereas it took five levels of blurring for venules to exceed 5 m broad-ening . Figure 2 illustrates this phenomenon by showing the progressive deterioration of the splat pattern as blurring is increased . For the proof-of-concept exercise in which we took pro-gressively defocused series of retinal images of three volun-teers , the change in micrometers from baseline was averaged for both CRAE and CRVE . As shown in Figure 3 , with each 3° turn of the focus knob , CRVE had a mean change of 5.6 m SD , 3.1 m , and CRAE had a mean change of 8.5 m SD , 7.6 m . Consequently , the end result was , on average , almost twice as much broadening for CRAE 20 m as for CRVE 10 m . DISCUSSION Our results demonstrate that variability in camera focus by the photographer has a measurable effect on apparent vessel cali-bers . Slight blurring has minimal effect , but more severe blur-ring but still within the range of quality typically received by the FPRC has progressively greater effect . This artificial broad-ening from defocusing is particularly apparent with CRAE , although CRVE is also significantly affected . Results from published epidemiologic studies can be used as a frame of reference for assessing the impact of the broad-ening effect from defocusing of images . In this instance , data from The Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis are used , shown in the Appendix.9 The significant interquartile ranges between groups are consistently 1 to 2 m . When taken in the context of this study , it is obvious that a shift of even a few micrometers in vessel caliber caused by defocusing could re-sult in subjects with defocused images being classified into the wrong quartile . This is representative of the sensitive nature of vascular measurement and the possible impact that even a slight systematic shift in micrometers could have on results . The CRAE was shown to be more vulnerable than the CRVE to a focus effect . One possible factor in this difference of effect is the lower contrast of arteriolar blood against RPE back-ground compared with that of venular blood . Relative vessel size may also contribute . Arterioles are typically smaller than venules , and defocusing may have a relatively greater effect as vessel size vessel decreases . One might expect that in a large population-based study , the effects of focus would be equally distributed among groups because of the large sample size . However , this assumes that focus affects all groups equally . If some groups are dispropor-tionately affected by focus , then comparisons of those groups would less accurate . For example , others9,10 have reported that there may be a pigmentation effect that systematically , and perhaps artificially , impacts vascular caliber measurement . Our study was not designed to investigate the effects of focus relative to retinal background pigmentation . However , as we have demonstrated experimentally , defocusing of images within the normal range of image quality could account for an effect of the magnitude reported . One might expect that lower contrast of the dark blood-filled vessels against greater RPE pigmentation might make it more difficult for photographers to achieve sharp focus on the vessels consistently . Furthermore , our observation of the overall greater impact from defocusing on CRAE lower RPE contrast compared with CRVE higher RPE contrast suggests that the defocusing effect might be exacerbated when both CRAE and CRVE contrast against an RPE background is reduced . Further investigation is warranted to illuminate this topic . In large epidemiologic studies , vascular measurement has already been shown to be useful for identifying associations with , and even prediction of , important systemic disorders . However , in such studies , it is difficult to isolate and study a particular methodological effect systematically . We have been able to approach this question through a simulation study by looking at the magnitude and thresholds of the impact of focus on measured vascular caliber . Our results suggest that using vascular measurement , as currently performed , to make close comparison of racial groups may be problematic . Provided a study includes enough subjects to be reasonably powered , one might assume that the subgroups of interest would be equally affected by measurement “noise” e.g. , arti-factually broader measurements . Consequently , the differ-ences between groups in mean CRAE or CRVE would still be real , although the absolute values might be slightly inflated . In contrast , however , if there are systematic differences between subgroups in factors that affect sharpness of focus e.g. , degree of pigmentation or lens opacity , the apparent differences between groups in vessel caliber may have to be examined further . Based on our findings , studies might consider tightening quality criteria for what constitutes acceptable focus . Although this appears desirable , it may not be feasible . In the real-world setting of academic clinics and examination centers , not every photographer will be technically skillful enough , using cur-rently available equipment , to obtain sharp focus for every subject . Nor might imposing stricter focus criteria be method-ologically sound . There may be real differences between sub-groups being compared that affect sharpness of focus . For example , the theory that the eyes of darker pigmented persons may be more challenging to focus sharply because they may not dilate as widely and because of the contrast between vessel and RPE the photographer uses for fine adjustment is less obvious . Our proof-of-concept exercise showed that the image edit-ing software format of artificially defocusing photographs us-ing the box blur function has a similar impact on the ability of IVAN to accurately measure vessel width as natural photo-graphic focus . Although we can not draw a precise comparison between the two , because we can not relate levels of blurring in image editing software to degrees of adjustment on a focus knob , both show obvious increases in vessel width as defocus-ing increases , although at somewhat different magnitudes . One limitation of our study is the subjective determination of focus . There is no method to quantify the level to which a photograph is defocused . Ideally , we would have an objective cutoff , after which images would be considered unusable . Another limitation of our study is that we performed it on a relatively small number of subjects . However , the phenome-non we are exploring is explainable through commonly ac-cepted optical principles . Thus , we would not expect the measurement of additional samples to change the tenor of our results . We have provided an introductory look at what could be a major factor that has yet to be widely taken into consid-eration when looking at results from vessel caliber measure-ments . There are several possible avenues of future study in this area . Media opacities also create a blurring effect on retinal photographs . We are particularly concerned about lens changes nuclear sclerosis , cortical and posterior subcapsular opacities . In theory , the blurring effect of media opacities is similar to that produced by a defocused camera . Thus , one would expect that vessel caliber would appear to be wider in eyes with greater media opacity . This could complicate sub-group comparisons for which systematic differences in media opacity are likely . We have yet to develop an effective method for simulating the effect of media opacity , but the possibility remains intriguing . To address the problem of the subjectivity of observer assessment of focus , we are attempting to develop a more objective and quantitative metric . For example , we have been looking at adapting the full-width half-height parame-ter used to evaluate focus in astronomical images . Ulti-mately , we hope to model the impact of different degrees of measurable defocusing so that we can develop and apply a method for post hoc correction of measurements on less than optimal images . The development of a real-time focus metric would help to objectively determine the quality of a photograph during the session when it could be retaken . This would eliminate the need for subjective photographer judgment . An alterna-tive would be to create a procedure that would allow us to quantify degree of defocusing in existing images and to estimate the actual dimensions of vessels based on a prag-matic correction model . A correction model would allow us to not only to determine quantifiable acceptability regarding focus but also to salvage unacceptable photographs by ap-plying post hoc correction . This would also help us to minimize any differences caused by systematic defocusing among groups . In conclusion , defocusing of retinal images artificially broad-ens the apparent diameters of both arterioles and venules , conceivably affecting outcomes studied in ocular epidemiology and clinical research . Investigators may have to consider dif-ferential image quality as a technical factor that could system-atically impact between-group comparisons in vascular mea-surement studies .

21948647	PURPOSE . Pseudoexfoliation PEX syndrome glaucoma is a complex , late-onset disorder of the elastic fiber system . Strong genetic risk is conferred by the lysyl oxidase-like 1 LOXL1 gene , but additional comodulating factors are necessary for the manifestation of the disease . The aim of this study was to analyze the effect of various PEX-associated pathogenic factors on the genotype-correlated expression of LOXL1 and elastin-related genes . METHODS . Cultured human Tenon’s capsule fibroblasts with high-and low-risk LOXL1 haplotypes were exposed to trans-forming growth factor TGF – 1 , interleukin IL -6 , homocys-teine , oxidative stress , hypoxia , or ultraviolet UV radiation . Changes in the expression of LOXL1 and elastic constituents of PEX material and TGF-1 were assessed by quantitative real-time PCR , Western blotting , immunohistochemistry , and elec-tron microscopy . RESULTS . Treatment of fibroblasts with TGF-1 , oxidative stress , UV light , and hypoxia induced a significant increase in expres-sion levels of LOXL1 and elastic proteins , whereas the effect of IL-6 was limited to induction of elastic constituents . Immuno-histochemistry and electron microscopy confirmed an upregu-lation of LOXL1 and elastic fiber proteins and their assembly into extracellular microfibrillar networks with focal aggrega-tion of microfibrils into PEX-like fibrils on stimulation with TGF-1 and oxidative stress . Basal and stimulated expression of LOXL1 mRNA and protein was slightly decreased in cells car-rying the high-risk compared with the low-risk haplotype of LOXL1 , but the differences between groups were statistically not significant . CONCLUSIONS . The findings support the notion that both genetic and nongenetic fibrogenic factors , particularly TGF-1 and oxida-tive stress , may cooperate in the stable accumulation of PEX aggregates . Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci . 2011 52 8488–8495 DOI 10.1167 iovs.11-8361 Palized seudoexfoliation PEX syndrome is an age-related , gener-disorder of the extracellular matrix characterized by disorder of the extracellular matrix characterized by the excessive production of elastic microfibrils and their ag-gregation into mature PEX fibrils.1 It accounts for a majority of glaucoma cases in some countries and for approximately 25 % of open-angle glaucoma cases worldwide.2 Progressive ob-struction of the aqueous humor outflow pathways by abnormal PEX material deposits is considered the primary cause of chronic pressure elevation and development of open-angle glaucoma in eyes with PEX syndrome.3 Moreover , PEX depos-its are found in a multitude of intra-and extraocular tissues , including conjunctiva , skin , and connective tissue compart-ments of visceral organs.1 As shown by biochemical and im-munohistochemical studies , PEX fibrils predominantly contain elastic fiber components , such as elastin , fibrillin-1 , latent trans-forming growth factor binding proteins LTBP-1 2 , and fibu-lins fibulin-2 4 , as well as lysyl oxidase-like 1 LOXL1 , 4–7 a key cross-linking matrix enzyme normally required for elastic fiber formation and stabilization.8 However , the exact compo-sition of the abnormal extracellular material as well as the mechanisms responsible for its excessive production and ac-cumulation still remain elusive . PEX syndrome is generally considered as a complex , multi-factorial , late-onset disease involving a combination of genetic and nongenetic factors in its etiopathogenesis.9 Genetic stud-ies in multiple geographical populations have provided conclu-sive evidence that single nucleotide polymorphisms SNPs in exon 1 of the LOXL1 gene represent the principal genetic risk factor for both PEX syndrome and PEX glaucoma.10,11 A com-mon haplotype G-G composed of the two coding SNPs rs1048661 R141L and rs3825942 G153D appears to be the strongest associated risk factor in Caucasian populations with PEX , 12 but also occurs in approximately 50 % of the normal population . Due to the high prevalence of the PEX-associated LOXL1 variants in the general population , it has been sug-gested that , in addition to the LOXL1 risk alleles , other genetic variants and or environmental factors are necessary for mani-festation of the PEX phenotype . Additional genetic factors with smaller effect sizes appear to include SNPs in the genes for clusterin CLU and contactin-associated protein-2 CNTNAP2 , which may act as modifying genes in certain populations.13–15 Moreover , several stress conditions associated with PEX , in-cluding oxidative stress , 16 hypoxia , 17 ultraviolet UV radia-tion , 18 as well as elevated levels of profibrotic growth factors and cytokines such as transforming growth factor-1 TGF-1 19 and interleukin-6 IL-6 , 20 may potentially act as comodu-lating external factors . Finally , elevated homocysteine levels in plasma and aqueous humor of patients with PEX may further contribute to PEX pathophysiology.21 LOXL1 is a key enzyme involved in elastic fiber synthesis and homeostasis by catalyzing the covalent cross-linking of tropoelastin monomers into elastin polymers.22 Recently , we provided evidence that LOXL1 and elastic fiber components are transiently upregulated in ocular tissues during the early stages of the fibrotic PEX process , suggesting their participa-tion in the formation and aggregation of abnormal PEX fibrils.5 This observation is in agreement with published studies dem - Disclosure M.

The purpose of the present study , therefore , was to analyze the effect of a number of PEX-associated pathogenic factors and stress conditions , including TGF-1 , IL-6 , homocysteine , oxidative stress , hypoxia , and UV radiation , on the expression of LOXL1 and elastic fiber proteins by human Tenon’s capsule fibroblasts obtained from patients with different LOXL1 haplo-types in vitro . The potential influence on expression of TGF-1 , a key mediator in PEX fibrogenesis , 19 was analyzed in addition . Here we show that most pathogenic factors , partic-ularly TGF-1 , oxidative stress , and UV light , have the ability to upregulate the expression of LOXL1 and major elastic fiber proteins present in PEX deposits , on both the mRNA and the protein level , in a dose-dependent manner . These factors were also found to stimulate the assembly of an elastic microfibrillar network and the formation of microfibrillar aggregates resem-bling PEX fibrils in the extracellular space . Although significant differences between LOXL1 haplotype groups could not be established , the findings support the notion that both genetic and nongenetic fibrogenic factors may cooperate in the stable accumulation of PEX aggregates . MATERIALS METHODS AND Cell Culture Real-Time RT-PCR Western Blot Analysis Immunohistochemistry Statistics RESULTS Effect of Fibrogenic Stimuli on mRNA Expression of LOXL1 and Elastic Proteins To investigate the effect of PEX-associated fibrogenic stimuli on the expression of LOXL1 and elastic constituents of PEX ma-terial , cultures of human Tenon’s capsule fibroblasts obtained from PEX patients n 4 were treated with either TGF-1 1–10 ng mL , IL-6 5–50 ng mL , or homocysteine 5–500 M , or exposed to oxidative stress 50–500 M H2O2 , hyp-oxia 2 % oxygen , or UV radiation 5–40 mJ cm2 up to 48 hours . To exclude potential genotype-related expression dif-ferences of LOXL1,5,10 all cell cultures used in these experi-ments carried the high-risk haplotype G-G in the homozygous state . To further exclude cytotoxic effects of stress conditions , cell viability assays were performed in parallel after stimulation with homocysteine , H2O2 , hypoxia , and UV radiation . Live dead assays revealed ratios of living versus dead cells that were not significantly different from untreated control cells within the applied time periods and intensities of stress data not shown . Quantitative real-time PCR demonstrated a time-and dose-dependent upregulation of most gene products in response to the various external factors applied . TGF-1 consistently caused a significant upregulation of all gene products analyzed Fig. 1 . Peak stimulatory effects were reached with 5 ng mL for LOXL1 4.3-fold P 0.005 and TGF-1 3.5-fold P 0.0005 , and with 10 ng mL for elastin 3.4-fold P 0.0005 , fibrillin-1 3.9-fold P 0.0005 , LTBP-1 2 up to 6.7-fold P 0.0005 , and fibulin-2 4 up to 2.9-fold P 0.0005 . IL-6 induced an overall weaker and more selective stimula-tion of the genes of interest Fig. 2 , with maximum levels of upregulation of elastin 2.9-fold P 0.0005 , fibrillin-1 3.7-fold P 0.0005 , and LTBP-1 2 up to 2.9-fold P 0.005 at a concentration of 25 ng mL , and TGF-1 2.4-fold P 0.0005 at a concentration of 50 ng mL . In contrast , LOXL1 , fibulin-2 , and fibulin-4 were completely unaffected by IL-6 . Homocysteine had a comparatively weak effect on the ex-pression of the selected gene products Fig. 3 . At the highest concentration of 500 M , only fibrillin-1 2.1-fold P 0.005 and TGF-1 2.2-fold P 0.005 were significantly upregu-lated . A tendency to increased expression of LOXL1 , LTBP-1 , and LTBP-2 1.5 to 1.7-fold by 500 M homocysteine , how-ever , did not reach statistical significance . Oxidative stress caused a consistent upregulation of all genes of interest Fig. 4 . Peak stimulatory effects were reached at 100 and 250 M of H2O2 for LOXL1 3.5-fold P 0.005 , 0.005 , **P 0.0005 . fibrillin-1 3.1-fold P 0.0005 , LTBP-1 2 up to 6.9-fold P 0.0005 , fibulin-2 4 up to 5.2-fold P 0.0005 , and TGF-1 2.6-fold P 0.0005 , followed by a decline in expression at 500 M of H2O2 . Only elastin 2.9-fold P 0.0005 reached maximum expression levels at 500 M of H2O2 . Similarly , exposure to UV radiation resulted in a consistent upregulation of all genes of interest Fig. 5 . Peak stimulatory effects were reached at intensities of 20 and 40 mJ cm2 for LOXL1 3.8-fold P 0.0005 , elastin 2.4-fold P 0.0005 , fibrillin-1 2.5-fold P 0.0005 , LTBP-1 2 up to 2.7-fold P 0.0005 , fibulin-2 4 up to 2.7-fold P 0.0005 , and TGF-1 2.2-fold P 0.0005 . Under hypoxic conditions Fig. 6 , a significant upregula-tion of LOXL1 3.4-fold P 0.005 mRNA expression was detectable as early as 12 hours after exposure to 2 % of oxygen . Maximum levels of upregulation were reached after 24 hours 4.9-fold P 0.005 . The induction of elastin expression reached significance after 24 hours 2.2-fold P 0.005 . In contrast , elastic microfibrillar components including fibrillin-1 , LTBPs , and fibulins were unaffected by reduced oxygen partial pressure . Comparative analysis revealed that expression of LOXL1 was predominantly stimulated by TGF-1 , hypoxia , oxidative stress , and UV light , whereas expressions of fibrillin-1 , the main component of PEX material , and TGF-1 , a key mediator of PEX fibrogenesis , were most effectively induced by TGF-1 , oxidative stress , and IL-6 , followed by UV radiation . To assess the effect of the most potent factors i.e. , TGF-1 and oxidative stress on protein expression and matrix assembly , immunohistochemical analyses using specific antibodies against LOXL1 , elastin , fibrillin-1 , LTBP-1 2 , and fibulin-2 4 were performed on cultured Tenon’s capsule fibroblasts from PEX patients n 4 , stimulated with either TGF-1 10 ng mL or H2O2 100 M for 72 hours Fig. 7 . In unstimulated control cultures , weak expression of LOXL1 was observed in the cytoplasm of fibroblasts . Elastic proteins were also ex-pressed intracellularly and immunolocalized to few extracellu-lar fibrous structures Fig. 7A . On stimulation with TGF-1 or oxidative stress , intracellular expression levels of LOXL1 and elastin not shown were markedly increased , whereas fibrillin-1 , LTBP-1 2 , and fibulin-2 4 could be mainly localized to prom-inent microfibrillar networks in the extracellular space Figs . 7B , 7C . Extracellular elastin matrix assembly was not observed within the short culture period . Specific immunostaining was abolished when an irrelevant primary antibody or PBS was used instead of the primary antibodies not shown . Ultrastructural investigation of fibroblast-containing matri-gels n 3 , simulating a natural three-dimensional 3D envi-ronment , disclosed individual fibroblasts in association with small bundles of microfibrils , approximately 8 to 10 nm in diameter , within electron-lucent pericellular spaces Fig. 8A . Stimulation with TGF-1 10 ng mL or H2O2 100 M for 72 hours appeared to increase production of microfibrils , which were occasionally observed to aggregate into thicker fibrils , approximately 35 to 45 nm in diameter , resembling mature PEX fibrils in vivo Figs . 8B , 8C .4 Influence of LOXL1 Haplotype on the Stimulatory Effect of Fibrogenic Factors To investigate the combined effects of fibrogenic stimuli and genetic background , cultured Tenon’s capsule fibroblasts car-rying the high-risk LOXL1 haplotype G-G in the homozygous state , derived from PEX patients n 3 , were compared with fibroblasts carrying a low-risk LOXL1 haplotype T-G , obtained from patients without PEX syndrome n 3 . Comparative analysis showed that the basal mRNA expression levels of LOXL1 displayed a tendency toward reduced expression ap-proximately 20 % in the presence of the high-risk haplotype G-G compared with the T-G haplotype Fig. 9 . On stimulation with TGF-1 10 ng mL or oxidative stress 100 M H2O2 for 48 hours , LOXL1 expression levels showed a similar decline in G-G cultures compared with T-G cultures , but these differences between the haplotype groups were statistically not signifi-cant . In addition , no significant differences were obtained for expression levels of elastin , fibrillin-1 , LTBP-1 2 , and fibulin-2 4 in both groups data not shown . To assess potential differences in LOXL1 protein synthesis and secretion , Western blot analyses were performed on ly-sates and supernatants of cells carrying the LOXL1 G-G or T-G haplotype without and with stimulation by TGF-1 10 ng mL . LOXL1 was detected in cell lysates and media with an apparent molecular mass of approximately 62 kDa , probably represent-ing the proenzyme , and with an additional band in culture media at 53 kDa , probably representing the active enzyme Fig. 10 . Whereas LOXL1 was barely detectable in unstimu-lated cells and media , stimulation with TGF-1 resulted in a marked upregulation of LOXL1 in both cell lysates and super-natants . Similar to mRNA expression levels , expression levels of LOXL1 protein appeared slightly reduced in cells carrying the G-G haplotype compared with the T-G haplotype on stim-ulation with TGF-1 , but levels of secreted LOXL1 revealed no obvious differences between the groups . DISCUSSION PEX syndrome is one of the most common causes of glaucoma worldwide.2 This disorder has been characterized as a gener-alized fibrotic matrix process , a stress-induced elastosis , asso-ciated with the excessive production and abnormal cross-link-ing of elastic microfibrillar proteins into fibrillar PEX aggregates.1,4 Profibrotic growth factors , particularly TGF-1 , increased cellular and oxidative stress , and low-grade inflam-matory processes appear to contribute to the formation and progressive accumulation of PEX material.4–7 Several lines of evidence , including regional clustering , fa-milial aggregation , and genetic analyses , have previously sup-ported a genetic predisposition to PEX.27 Since a simple inher-itance model was not evident , a complex inheritance pattern caused by the contribution of multiple genetic factors and environmental conditions has been suggested.28 To date , cir-cumstantial evidence exists for the contribution of several genes with relatively small effect sizes , such as CLU clusterin , CNTNAP2 contactin-associated protein-like 2 , and APOE apolipoprotein E , in some study populations indicating a modifying rather than a direct genetic effect.9,13–15 In contrast , LOXL1 has been identified as a major contributor and principal genetic risk factor for PEX throughout all geographical popu-lations examined.10,11 Although the PEX-associated LOXL1 mis-sense variants showed a different allele frequency within dif-ferent geographical populations , a high-risk haplotype G-G formed by the two coding SNPs rs1048661 R141L and rs3825942 G153D appeared to be the strongest associated risk factor for PEX in Caucasian and European populations , whereas the T-G and G-A haplotypes were associated with lower risks.10–12 However , approximately 50 % of the normal population was also found to carry the high-risk haplotype , indicating that , in addition to LOXL1 risk alleles , other PEX-specific genetic variants or environmental factors may contrib-ute to the risk of developing the PEX phenotype . Recently , novel polymorphisms in the promoter region of LOXL1 have been identified to be associated with PEX syndrome glaucoma in a U.S. Caucasian population and were suggested to influence LOXL1 gene expression by causing a reduction in LOXL1 protein expression and activity.29 In fact , dysregulated expression of LOXL1 has been previ-ously shown to be substantially involved in PEX pathophysiol-ogy . The available data indicate that LOXL1 is transiently up-regulated in anterior segment tissues at early stages of PEX fibrogenesis , together with elastic fiber constituents , to partic-ipate in the formation of the aberrant fibrillar aggregates.5,30 Thus , LOXL1 and elastic fiber components , such as elastin , fibrillin-1 , LTBP-1 2 , and fibulin-2 4 , were found to be promi-nent components of fibrillar PEX aggregates in the anterior segment . In the posterior segment , lamina cribrosa tissue of PEX eyes revealed a site-specific downregulation of LOXL1 and elastic fiber constituents , which was associated with a pro-nounced elastosis of the laminar beams and which has been suggested to represent a major susceptibility factor for a PEX-associated risk of glaucoma development and progression Schlötzer-Schrehardt U , et al. , manuscript submitted , 2011 . These differential expression patterns indicate that other PEX-and tissue-specific factors may modulate local LOXL1 expres-sion levels in addition to genetic predisposition . In view of these considerations , it is reasonable to assume that the combined effect of LOXL1 genotype and external factors or stress conditions with fibrogenic potential , which are known to be present in the anterior segment of PEX eyes , might influence the manifestation of the disease i.e. , the ac-cumulation of abnormal fibrillar aggregates . Candidate factors , which might stimulate the synthesis of abnormal PEX fibrils , include profibrotic growth factors TGF-1 , 19 cytokines IL-6 , 20 and amino acids homocysteine , 21 as well as various stress conditions such as oxidative stress , 16 UV radiation , 18 and hypoxia.17 In response to these profibrotic triggering factors , LOXL1 may become upregulated in PEX tissues together with elastic matrix components serving as putative substrates for an abnormal cross-linking action of the enzyme . It is likely that through such protein–protein interactions the effects of the PEX-associated LOXL1 variants become more significant.30 Using human Tenon’s capsule fibroblasts in both 2D-and 3D-cell culture models , we first analyzed the capacity of PEX-associated pathogenic factors to regulate the expression of LOXL1 and major integral components of PEX material . TGF-1 , oxidative stress , hypoxia , and UV light were found to induce a significant increase in expression levels of LOXL1 and elastic proteins in a time-and dose-dependent manner com-pared with untreated controls , whereas the effect of IL-6 was limited to induction of elastic constituents . TGF-1 and oxida-tive stress proved to be the most potent factors to stimulate the coordinated expression of LOXL1 , fibrillin-1 , the main compo-nent of PEX fibrils , and TGF-1 , a key cytokine in the fibrotic PEX process . In contrast , hardly any effect on expression levels could be seen for homocysteine . Immunohistochemistry con-firmed an upregulation of LOXL1 and elastic fiber proteins and their assembly into extracellular microfibrillar networks on stimulation with TGF-1 and oxidative stress after 3 days in culture . Moreover , focal aggregation of microfibrils into thicker fibrils resembling PEX fibrils could be observed in 3D-culture systems by electron microscopy . These findings are consistent with previous studies demon-strating a broad responsiveness of extracellular matrix genes to a wide array of profibrotic stimuli including TGF-1 , oxidative stress , UV light , hypoxia , IL-6 , and homocysteine in various cell types in vitro.20,31–35 Lysyl oxidase family members have also been shown to be upregulated by a variety of external factors including TGF-1,36–38 oxidative stress , 39 hypoxia , 40 and me-chanical stress.41 Homocysteine was found to suppress LOX expression and activity in vascular endothelial cells42 and in-hibited LOX activity in the vitreous body.43 Thus , upregulation of lysyl oxidases was shown to underlie the onset and progres-sion of various fibrotic disorders , such as liver fibrosis , 23 whereas reduced expression of these cross-linking enzymes has been associated with the pathophysiology of diseases af-fecting connective tissues e.g. , cardiovascular diseases .44 In contrast , IL-6 did not significantly regulate LOX expression by gingival fibroblasts , 45 which is in agreement with the present findings on LOXL1 . To further investigate the combined effect of external fac-tors and LOXL1 genotype on expression levels of LOXL1 and elastic proteins , cell cultures carrying the high-risk haplotype G-G in the homozygous state were compared with cell cultures carrying a low-risk LOXL1 haplotype T-G . Although basal and stimulated expression levels of LOXL1 displayed a tendency toward reduced expression in cells with the G-G haplotype compared with the T-G haplotype , the differences were statis-tically not significant , which may be due to the small sample size analyzed n 3 or to in vitro conditions only imperfectly mimicking the in vivo situation . In conclusion , the present findings support the notion that both genetic and nongenetic fibrogenic factors , particularly TGF-1 and oxidative stress , may cooperate in the induction of PEX fiber formation and cross-linking and the stable accumu-lation of PEX aggregates within anterior segment tissues . The 2D-and 3D-cell cultures established may also serve as model systems to further analyze the molecular pathophysiology of PEX syndrome and to develop new strategies for an antifibrotic therapy of this potentially blinding disease .

Introduction The loss of corneal transparency due to decompensated endo-thelium is a major indication for corneal transplantation e.g. , Fuch’s dystrophy , of which there are w40,000 annually in the U.S. Other indications include bullous keratopathy , keratoconus , a variety of corneal dystrophies , and chemical burn . Even after transplantation , survival of the endothelium is a major concern Armitage et al. , 2003 George and Larkin , 2004 Niederkorn , 2007 . The central endothelial cell loss of the donor cornea during the first post-operative year exceeds 30 % despite the use of immunosup-pressive agents . Therefore , understanding the basic mechanisms of the endothelial dysfunction in response to pro-inflammatory mediators , which are released secondary to the immune response during allograft rejection , is of prime importance . The focus of this review is on the endothelial dysfunction in response to TNF-a , which can be found in the cornea and aqueous humor during allograft rejection Rayner et al. , 2000 , 2001 and anterior uveitis . * Tel . ? 1 812 855 0132 fax ? 1 812 855 7045 . E-mail address srinivas @ indiana.edu . Our goal is to identify a class of small molecular weight inhibitors , which can be applied topically to directly treat endothelial dysfunction during allograft rejection and uveitis . 2 . The barrier function of the corneal endothelium The endothelium , an epithelial interface between the anterior chamber and the corneal stroma , is a monolayer of cells that forms a regular hexagonal mosaic at the posterior surface of the cornea . Its main function is to preserve stromal deturgescence , which is a prerequisite for corneal transparency . The principal challenge for maintaining deturgescence is the swelling pressure associated with the hydrophilic glycosaminoglycans GAGs in the stroma . This negative pressure induces a continuous fluid leak into the stroma from the anterior chamber . Although the endothelium trans-endothelial electrical resistance , or TER , w30 U cm2 is leaky Noske et al. , 1994 Fischbarg et al. , 2006 , its tight junctions TJs restrict the rate of leakage and thereby oppose potential corneal edema . This role of the endothelium , referred to as the barrier function , is dependent on the integrity of its tight and adherens junctions a.k.a. , barrier integrity . In a healthy cornea , the fluid leak is counter-balanced by an active fluid pump mechanism associated with the endothelium . The overall mechanism , which constitutes the Pump-Leak hypothesis as first propounded by Maurice Maurice 1984 Riley , 1985 Edelhauser , 2006 , is shown schemat-ically in Fig. 1 . The fluid pump activity of the endothelium , similar to that of other fluid transporting epithelia , is dependent on the ion transport mechanisms , expressed strategically at its basolateral and apical membranes Bonanno , 2003 . These mechanisms elicit a net movement of Na ? and HCO3 Cl from the stroma into the aqueous humor . Based on the theory of soluteesolvent coupling Diamond and Bossert , 1967 , it is envisaged that the net ionic movement sets up local osmotic gradients across the apical membrane , leading to vectorial fluid movement into the anterior chamber . In order for this transcellular fluid movement to be efficacious , the integrity of the TJs is crucial Srinivas , 2010 from two points of view . First , the TJs must prevent dissipation of the ionic gradients set up by the ion transport mechanisms by blocking trivial back-flux through the paracellular space referred to as the “gate” function of the TJs . Second , TJs must also limit the lateral diffusion of the integral membrane proteins , including those of the ion transport mecha-nisms . This so-called “fence” function of the TJs , though a slow process , is critical for maintaining the apicalebasal polarity of the transport proteins in the endothelium . In the absence of polarized ion transport , vectorial ionic movement by the endothelium would not be possible . Overall , the barrier integrity of the corneal endo-thelium is indispensable for maintaining stromal deturgescence and , hence , corneal transparency . In the following , we review recent findings on the barrier integrity of the corneal endothelium vis-à-vis cell signaling linked to actomyosin contraction Satpathy et al. , 2004 , 2005 Srinivas et al. , 2004 Srinivas et al. , 2006 Jalimarada et al. , 2009 Ramachandran and Srinivas , 2010 and briefly discuss trans - Normal cornea Epithelium Leak Normal Endothelium endothelial electrical resistance TER based on electrical cell-substrate impedance sensing ECIS as a measure of barrier integ-rity Ramachandran and Srinivas , 2010 . Specifically , our findings have demonstrated that ECIS enables measurements of TER with high sensitivity and in real-time . Finally , we review recent work on the TNF-a -induced loss of barrier integrity in the bovine corneal endothelium Shivanna and Srinivas , 2009 , 2010 Shivanna et al. , 2010 . The TJs in the corneal endothelium offer weak resistance to paracellular permeability of solutes and water Srinivas , 2010 . Even slight damage to the TJs is sufficient to precipitate stromal swelling . A typical TJ consists of transmembrane proteins bound to cytoplasmic plaques , which are fused to the cortical actin cyto-skeleton through a variety of linker proteins . The paracellular pathway is occluded by homophilic interactions of the trans-membrane proteins of the TJs occludins , claudins , and junctional adhesion molecule . Cellecell proximity , achieved by the tethering forces at the TJs is essential for interactions between the trans-membrane proteins . Contraction of the cortical actin cytoskeleton generates a centripetal force opposing the tethering forces at the TJs , leading to a breakdown of the cellecell apposition and barrier integrity . This form of cytoskeletal regulation of the barrier integ-rity is known in vascular endothelium and also in certain epithelial monolayers Garcia et al. , 1995 Dudek and Garcia , 2001 Mehta and Malik , 2006 . The actomyosin contraction is regulated by phosphorylation of the regulatory light chain of Myosin II referred to as Myosin Light Chain or MLC . The extent of MLC phosphorylation is determined by two opposing pathways MLCK MLC Kinase -driven phosphoryla-tion and MLCP MLC Phosphatase -driven dephosphorylation summarized in Fig. 2 Somlyo and Somlyo , 2003 Srinivas , 2010 Ramachandran et al. , 2011 . MLCK is the dedicated kinase for phosphorylating MLC and is activated when bound to the Ca2 ? -calmodulin complex . MLC is dephosphorylated by MLCP , a hetero-trimeric complex consisting of PP1Cd the catalytic subunit of MLCP , a myosin-binding subunit MYPT1 130 kDa , and a small subunit M21 21 kDa of unknown function . Phosphorylation of MYPT1 by Rho kinase at T696 and T853 Fig. 2B inhibits the phosphatase activity of PP1Cd . PKC Protein Kinase C inactivates MLCP through phosphorylation of CPI-17 PKC-activated 17 kDa inhibitor protein of type 1 phosphatase 17 kDa , which is known to inactivate PP1Cd not shown in Fig. 2 Somlyo and Somlyo , 2003 Srinivas , 2010 Ramachandran et al. , 2011 . Overall , the activation of Rho kinase and or PKC results in actomyosin contraction . In contrast to Rho kinase and PKC , Protein kinase A PKA opposes actomyosin contraction . Specifically , RhoA is phosphorylated by PKA at Ser-188 , which prevents dissociation of RhoA-GDI RhoA-GDP-dissociation inhibitor from RhoA-GDP and thereby curtails activation of RhoA Ramachandran et al. , 2011 . A number of studies have shown that increased MLC phos-phorylation , which generally induces actomyosin contraction throughout the cell , significantly affects the contraction of the pool of actin cytoskeleton at the apical junction complex referred to as the peri-junctional actomyosin ring or PAMR and is responsible for the breakdown of the barrier integrity Srinivas , 2010 . We have found that thrombin activates RhoAeRho kinase axis through G12 13-coupled PAR-1 Protease-activated receptor-1 receptors in bovine corneal endothelial cells Fig. 3 Satpathy et al. , 2004 , 2005 Srinivas et al. , 2004 . The resulting increase in MLC phosphoryla-tion leads to a disruption of the PAMR with a concomitant break-down of the barrier integrity . In two subsequent studies Srinivas A 0.15 nm 470 0.10 OD 0.05 Active MLCP Active PP1C et al. , 2004 Satpathy et al. , 2005 , we demonstrated that the thrombin-induced MLC phosphorylation and the breakdown in the barrier integrity can be suppressed by elevated cAMP , which inhibits activation of RhoA Ramachandran et al. , 2008 , 2011 . We have also investigated the Ca2 ? -and PKC-dependent mechanisms involved in MLC phosphorylation upon activation of H1 receptors Srinivas et al. , 2006 , which are not known to activate RhoA . These experiments showed that the histamine-induced MLC phosphory-lation and the resulting loss of endothelial barrier integrity can be suppressed by ML-7 a selective MLCK inhibitor and a PKC inhib-itor , indicating a role of MLCK and PKC Srinivas et al. , 2006 . These findings are consistent with the cell signaling in the regulation of actomyosin contraction and the breakdown of the barrier integrity as depicted in Fig. 2A . Apart from the direct impact of the actin cytoskeleton , we have also found that there is significant cross-talk between actin cyto-skeleton and microtubules Jalimarada et al. , 2009 . Specifically , deliberate microtubule disassembly by exposure to nocodazole led to activation of RhoA , consequent disruption of the PAMR , and loss of the barrier integrity . These studies also emphasize a strong role for actin cytoskeleton along the locus of the apical junctional complex in the regulation of the corneal endothelial barrier integrity . Taken together , our results also provide insights into how other bioactive factors found in the aqueous humor may influence the barrier function of the endothelium and alter stromal hydration control in a dynamic manner . 4 . Breakdown and formation of the tight junctions in the endothelium In contrast to the indirect influence of enhanced actomyosin contraction , cell loss presents a direct threat to the barrier integrity of the corneal endothelium as it is not regenerative in humans Joyce , 2003 . While loss of endothelial cells occurs constantly during aging , it is pronounced during Fuchs’ dystrophy , following allograft rejection Srinivas , 2010 , and in response to iatrogenic injury e.g. , phacoemulsification . In situ-ations where endothelial monolayer sustains loss of cells , understanding the factors likely to impact on the reassembly of cellecell junctions and reestablishing the barrier integrity following cell spreading in an effort to cover the denuded area is crucial . In this context , we recently investigated the influence of actin cytoskeleton on the dynamics of disassembly and reas-sembly of the AJs and TJs upon extracellular Ca2 ? depletion and Ca2 ? add-back , respectively Ramachandran and Srinivas , 2010 . To follow the temporal course of the integrity of the AJs and TJs during Ca2 ? switch , we measured TER with ECIS using ECIS1600R , Applied Biophysics , Inc. , Troy , NY . ECIS allows rapid changes in TER to be measured in real-time Srinivas , 2010 . For ECIS , cells are grown to confluence on small , gelatin-coated gold electrodes . A small AC current is applied across the cells , and the impedance for the current flow is then measured by a lock-in amplifier at w0.1 Hz . The resistive component of the impedance for the current flow represents TER since the plasma membrane resistance is large Tiruppathi et al. , 1992 . Fig. 4A shows the dynamics of TER in response to cytochalasin D , which is known to experiment , electrodes were inoculated with bovine corneal endothelial cells and grown to grow to confluence . TER reached a steady state in w18 h and then cells were exposed to cyto-chalasin D. As an actin polymerization inhibitor , cytochalasin D breaks up the PAMR , and as a result , barrier integrity is lost . Fig. 4B shows the response to the Ca2 ? switch protocol . Disas-sembly of the AJs , and as a consequence TJs , was induced by replacing Ringers containing 2 mM Ca2 ? with Ca2 ? -free Ringers containing 2 mM EGTA . Subsequently , reassembly of the AJs , and thus resealing of the TJs , was promoted by exposing to Ca2 ? -rich Ringers 2 mM Ca2 ? on the same cells . As expected , expo-sure to the Ca2 ? -free medium led to precipitous loss in the TER Fig. 4B , and subsequent repletion of Ca2 ? led to a recovery of the TER Fig. 4B . These results from our recent study Ramachandran and Srinivas , 2010 not only show that ECIS-based TER measurements reflect the status of the barrier integrity but also quantify the dynamics of reformation of the AJs and TJs . By Western blot analysis , we have also shown evidence that Ca2 ? depletion results in activation of RhoA following disengagement of cadherins i.e. , breakdown of AJs Ramachandran and Srinivas , 2010 . This activation is likely to have contributed toward accel-eration of the breakdown of the TJs since pre-exposure to Y-27632 a selective Rho kinase inhibitor and blebbistatin a selective Myosin II ATPase inhibitor inhibited the response to Ca2 ? depletion Fig. 4C . Interestingly , actomyosin contraction is also essential for the reformation of the AJs and TJs , as shown in Fig. 4D . These results establish a role for actomyosin contraction in the reformation of AJs and TJs following cell spreading , which is induced by focal loss of endothelial cells . B 1.0 TER D TER 5 . Involvement of TNF-a in the corneal allograft rejection and anterior uveitis The corneal endothelium is a direct target of intraocular inflam-mationduringanterioruveitis bystandereffect andallograftrejection following corneal transplantation . Anterior uveitis involves cellular infiltration neutrophils , CD4 ? T cells , an increase in protein perme-ability i.e. , duetobreakdownofbloodeaqueousbarrier , upregulation of cytokines e.g. , TNF-a , IL-1b , and IFN-g and chemokines e.g. , MCP-1 monocyte chemotactic protein-1 in the aqueous humor and uveal tract El-Shabrawi and Hermann , 2002 Johnsen-Soriano et al. , 2010 . Autoimmune diseases , bacterial viral infections , and chemical and metabolic injuries are known to induce uveitis . In addition to the use of topical systemic immunosuppressive drugs , treatment targeted to the corneal endothelium would be useful to prevent corneal edema and consequent loss ofacute vision.As noted earlier , allograftrejection is also relatively frequent in high-risk transplantation George and Larkin , 2004 . As with anterior uveitis , TNF-a is also implicated in the corneal endothelial failure during allograft rejection the transcrip-tional activity of the cytokine has been detected , and TNF-a levels are also significantly elevated in the aqueous humor and the serum Rayner et al. , 2000 , 2001 . The cytokine is presumed to be released mainly from the circulating cells of the immune system , which infil-trate the anterior chamber during rejection . In consistence with the inflammatory load in the aqueous humor , the corneal endothelial cells show significant elevation in the expression of a variety of adhesion molecules that potentiate firm adhesion and transmigration of leukocytes into the stroma . These include intercellular adhesion molecule-1 ICAM-1 , endothelial leukocyte adhesion molecule-1 E-selectin , and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 VCAM-1 . a therapy has been found to be efficacious , indicating the relevance of the cytokine in the corresponding pathophysiology . A number of studies have demonstrated regulation of barrier integrity by cytokines , leading to a clear understanding of the etiology of a number of pathological conditions Capaldo and Nusrat , 2009 . In addition to their pro-inflammatory role e.g. , through the expression of cell adhesion molecules , cytokines break down the barrier integ-rity through distinct mechanisms of cell signaling independent of apoptosis Bruewer et al. , 2003 . Given the prominent role of pro-inflammatory cytokines in many pathological situations , the impact of TNF-a in the breakdown of the barrier integrity of a variety of endothelial and epithelial monolayers has been examined Capaldo and Nusrat , 2009 . A previous study by Watsky et al. has shown that TNF-a breaks down the barrier integrity of the corneal endo-thelium Watsky et al. , 1996 . However , the molecular mechanisms in the corneal endothelium remain unexplored . In other epithelia , the cytokine is known to break down the barrier integrity concomitant with disruption of the PAMR , formation of stress fibers , and disas-sembly of microtubules Goldblum et al. , 1993 Watsky et al. , 1996 Petrache et al. , 2003 Ye et al. , 2006 . Despite the formation of stress fibers , inhibitors of the actomyosin contraction e.g. , Y-27632-mediated inhibition of Rho kinase have not been efficacious in the corneal endothelium unpublished data . These observations led us to focus on other mechanisms , especially those involving p38 MAP kinase Shivanna and Srinivas , 2009 , 2010 Shivanna et al. , 2010 . 6 . Response to TNF-a 6.1 . Disassembly of microtubules Among the known pathophysiologic stresses , oxidative stress and exposure to cytokines e.g. , TNF-a , and TGF-b and proteases e.g. , thrombin are known to cause disassembly of microtubules Petrache et al. , 2003 Birukova et al. , 2004 , 2005 . Since we had B 10 4 0 TER % -40 -50 D 0 TER -10 in previously shown that microtubule disassembly breaks down the barrier integrity of the corneal endothelium Jalimarada et al. , 2009 , we first examined the effect of TNF-a on microtubules Shivanna and Srinivas , 2009 . As expected , exposure to the cyto-kine led to disassembly of the microtubules and also caused disruption of the PAMR . As shown in Fig. 5A , exposure to TNF-a caused a slow decline in TER during a 20-hr period . A similar exposure to cells grown on porous culture inserts led to a signifi-cant increase in the permeability to FITC dextran 10 kDa . These changes , which indicate a loss of the barrier integrity , were also reflected by dislocation of ZO-1 at the cell border and disassembly of cadherins Shivanna and Srinivas , 2009 . To confirm these responses , we challenged cells with the cytokine after stabilizing the microtubules using paclitaxel . As shown in Fig. 5A and B , paclitaxel induced microtubule stabilization and suppressed the response to TNF-a Shivanna and Srinivas , 2009 . 6.2 . Activation of p38 MAP kinase The TNF-a -induced disassembly of microtubules indicated a role for p38 MAP kinase in the cytokine response . Previous studies with vascular endothelial cells have demonstrated p38 MAP kinase-dependent reactive oxygen species ROS production and activation of Hsp27 heat shock protein 27 Mehta and Malik , 2006 . While ROS is known to cause microtubule disassembly , activation of Hsp27 is associated with the disruption of the actin cytoskeleton . In this context , we investigated whether the TNF-a -induced activation of p38 MAP kinase is involved in the microtubule disassembly , disruption of the PAMR , and breakdown of the barrier integrity Shivanna et al. , 2010 . We first observed that exposure to the cytokine results in a transient activation of p38 MAP kinase , as determined by Western blot analysis . Accordingly , exposure to SB-203580 a selective inhibitor of p38 MAP kinase suppressed the loss inTER Fig. 5C and D and opposed the impact of the cytokine on the actin cytoskeleton and microtubules Shivanna et al. , 2010 . These results , taken together , suggest that TNF-a breaks down the endothelial barrier integrity via acute activation of p38 MAP kinase . 6.3 . Effect of elevated cAMP Elevated cAMP increases barrier integrity in the corneal endo-thelium . Riley et al . Riley et al. , 1998 demonstrated enhanced stromal hydration control through cAMP-mediated decrease in the paracellular permeability to carboxyfluorescein . In recent studies , we also found that agents that elevate cAMP suppressed the thrombin-and histamine-induced loss of barrier integrity in the corneal endothelium Srinivas et al. , 2004 , 2006 Srinivas , 2010 . In contrast to these findings , cAMP levels are reportedly reduced in response to TNF-a through an upregulation of cAMP-dependent phosphodiesterases PDE activities . Furthermore , there are many bioactive factors , including adrenomedullin and vasoactive intes-tinal peptide VIP , in the aqueous humor that have the potential to increase cAMP in the corneal endothelium . As we showed earlier , the endothelium also expresses adenosine-sensitive A2B receptors , which are coupled to Gs G-protein Srinivas et al. , 2004 . Given these considerations , we recently examined the effect of elevated cAMP in the corneal endothelium in response to TNF-a Shivanna and Srinivas , 2010 . As shown in Fig. 6A and B , we observed that B 0 TER -10 in D 0 TER -10 in co-treatment with forskolin a direct activator of adenylate cyclase 10 mM and rolipram a selective inhibitor of a cAMP-dependent PDE4 50 mM prevented the TNF-a -induced sustained decrease in TER . Similar co-treatments also inhibited the TNF-a -induced activation of p38 MAP kinase , disassembly of microtubules , and disruption of the PAMR Shivanna and Srinivas , 2010 . We also confirmed these responses with the use of A2B agonists e.g. , adenosine and NECA to elevate cAMP as shown in Fig. 6C and D. These findings indicate a cross-talk between cAMP and p38 MAP kinase that is yet to be understood . 7 . Summary and conclusions The barrier integrity of the corneal endothelium complements its fluid transport activity by maintaining stromal deturgescence , which is essential for corneal transparency . The barrier integrity , dependent on the TJs , is closely linked to the plasticity of the actin cytoskeleton and microtubules . Extracellular stresses involving cytokines and neurohormonal stimuli mobilize the activity of small GTPases of the Rho family and or stress kinases e.g. , p38 MAP kinase and , in turn , produce actin remodeling , actomyosin contraction , and or microtubule disassembly . These changes enable remodeling of the apical junctional complex , leading to changes in the barrier integrity , cellecell adhesion , and intercellular commu-nication D’Hondt et al. , 2007 Ponsaerts et al. , 2008 . Therefore , the endothelial barrier integrity is susceptible to extracellular stresses . We have highlighted these aspects with TNF-a , a pro-inflammatory cytokine found in the aqueous humor during allograft rejection and anterior uveitis . Our findings have shown that the response to the cytokine is set forth with an acute activation of p38 MAP kinase , leading to a disassembly of microtubule and breakdown of the barrier integrity . We have also demonstrated that elevated cAMP , which is known to stimulate fluid transport through enhanced ion transport , opposes the TNF-a response . These results will be helpful in finding potential strategies to rescue , prevent , and overcome loss of barrier integrity of the corneal endothelium .

21979996	PURPOSE . The origin of autofluorescence in the subretinal space and the autofluorescence properties of the cells were investi-gated in surgically collected subretinal fluid . METHODS . Subretinal fluid was surgically collected from four eyes of patients with rhegmatogenous retinal detachment three eyes and Coats’ disease one eye . After cytocentrifuge preparation of the cells in the fluid and immunofluorescence staining , a cytologic examination was conducted by using con-focal scanning laser microscopy . The autofluorescence of the cells was elucidated by measuring the fluorescence spectra with spectroscopy , to obtain different excitation laser light emission fingerprints . RESULTS . The cells from the subretinal fluid were classified into three types CD68-negative cells containing numerous pig-mented granules , CD68-positive cells containing few pigments , and CD68-negative cells with no pigmented granules . Autofluo-rescence was observed in the inclusions of the cells classified into the former two types . When the cells were excited by a 458-or 488-nm laser light , emission spectra in autofluores-cence showed little difference between CD68-positive and -negative cells . Peak analysis confirmed that the two types of cells showed the same emission peaks within this range of excitation light . CONCLUSIONS . Autofluorescent inclusions appeared in the CD68-positive and -negative cells in the subretinal fluid . The macro-phages in the subretinal fluid possess autofluorescence that is spectroscopically similar to lipofuscin . Autofluorescence of macrophages can be attributed to degenerated outer segments and debris from apoptotic photoreceptors . Clinicians should consider migration of macrophages , in addition to retinal pig-ment epithelium , as the possible source when abnormal fun-dus autofluorescence is observed using an ordinary set of fluorescence filters . Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci . 2011 52 8534–8541 DOI 10.1167 iovs.11-8012 Ffuscin undus autofluorescence FAF mainly originates from lipo-in the retinal pigment epithelium . Recent studies in the retinal pigment epithelium . Recent studies revealed that a main constituent of lipofuscin that generates autofluorescence is pyridinium bisretinoid A2E .1–3 The deriv-atives of A2E in the photoreceptor outer segments are consid-ered to be another source of abnormal FAF . Novel imaging technology of FAF and optical coherence tomography demon-strated subretinal autofluorescent deposits in some macular diseases with serous retinal detachment , such as vitelliform macular dystrophy , 4,5 central serous chorioretinopathy , 6–11 choroidal melanoma , 12 and Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease.13 Various materials or cells have been proposed as the origin of autofluorescent deposits . These include migrating retinal pig-ment epithelial cells , debris of degenerated photoreceptor outer segments , or macrophages that have phagocytosed the outer segments . Among them , macrophages are thought to be the main source of the subretinal autofluorescent deposits.14 Migrating macrophages in the subretinal space are often found in histopathologic specimens and surgically excised tissue from patients with several retinal diseases , such as Best’s vitel-liform macular dystrophy , 15,16 age-related macular degenera-tion , 17,18 macular holes , 19 rhegmatogenous retinal detachment RRD , 20,21 and Coats’ disease.21,22 However , it is not clearly demonstrated that macrophages are the source of autofluores-cence in the subretinal space . In the present study , we inves-tigated surgically collected cells in the subretinal fluid and characterized the fluorescence properties of the cells . Disclosure T. Sekiryu , None Y.

Clinical Features of the Patients Patient Fluorescence Spectroscopy RESULTS Identification of Cells The ages of the patients with RRD were 11 , 17 , and 24 years Table 1 . Preoperative examination revealed yellow precipi-tates and corresponding granular autofluorescence on the outer surface of the retina in all three eyes with long-standing RRD . All eyes with retinal detachment had subretinal strands that showed hyperautofluorescence Fig. 1 . The eye with Coats’ disease in a 15-year-old boy showed diffuse hyperauto-fluorescence in the area of bullous retinal detachment . Part of hyperautofluorescence appeared as spotted hyperautofluores-cent lesions between the retinal folds Fig. 2 . The cells from the subretinal space were classified into three types . The first type was relatively large , round cells that had well-defined cytoplasm and nuclei covered with numerous pig-ments . Heavily pigmented cells were negative for CD68 staining . Autofluorescent inclusions appeared in the cytoplasm Fig. 3 . This type of cell frequently appeared in the specimens of the RRD cases . The second type was large 20–50 m in diameter , rounded or polygonal cells with few or no pigments . Differential interference contrast microscopy showed various sizes of vacu-oles in the cytoplasm . Most of the subretinal cells in the eye with Coats’ disease were positive for CD68 staining patient 4 . The contour of vacuoles was clearly observed when the cells were stained immunocytochemically. Autofluorescent inclusions ap-peared in the cytoplasm and in some vacuoles Fig. 4 . This type of cell appeared more frequently in the specimens from the subretinal fluid of Coats’ disease . The third type of cell is the spindle-shaped or oval cells that had few or no pig-ments in the cytoplasm . These cells were negative for CD68 staining and did not show autofluorescence . The density of each type of the cells was summarized in Figure 5 . Fluorescence Spectroscopy Fluorescence spectroscopy was applied to the first two types of cells . The intensity of autofluorescence of inclusions in the cells with CD68-positive or -negative cells stained with anti-CD68 antibody probed by AlexaFluor-647-labeled secondary antibody was examined with various excitation lights 458 , 488 , 514 , 543 , and 633 nm . The cells were characterized by the presence of far-red to infrared fluorescence excited by a 633-nm laser Figs . 6I , 6J . Unexpectedly , when excited by a 458-or 488-nm laser light , emission spectra of autofluores-cence showed little difference , either in CD68-positive or -neg-ative cells Figs. 6A–D . The emission peak at 580 nm was comparable in either type of cell . Red fluorescence obtained by excitation with longer wavelengths 514 and 543 nm was higher in CD68-positive cells Figs. 6E–H , but the CD68-neg-ative cells still showed significant autofluorescence . We could not find any remarkable difference in the spectra between the cells from the eyes with RRD and that from the eye with Coats’ disease . To obtain quantitative information , peak analysis was performed for each emission curve on a total of 50 autofluo-rescent inclusions in four to six typical cells from each of the four specimens Table 2 . Consistent with Figure 6 , this anal-ysis also indicates that almost all CD68-negative cells contain apparent autofluorescent vesicles , demonstrating that autofluo-rescence does not associate with CD68 expression . In the 458-and 488-nm emission spectra , the cells classified as the former two types showed the narrow peak at the same wavelength . DISCUSSION Characteristics of autofluorescence were examined in the cells collected from subretinal fluid in eyes with retinal detachment , which showed autofluorescence in the area of retinal detach-ment . The cells were classified morphologically and immunocy-tologically , with CD68 used as the marker for macrophages . We found that autofluorescent inclusions appeared in the CD68-pos-itive cells and -negative cells . No clear difference in autofluores-cence spectra was observed in the two types of cells . Although the main origin of FAF is lipofuscin in the retinal pigment epithelium , the subretinal deposits also show auto-fluorescence in eyes with retinal detachment caused by RRD , 22 central serous chorioretinopathy , 8,10,11,23 Best’s disease , 4,24 age-related macular degeneration , 25 or choroidal hemangi - oma.26 It has been speculated that the autofluorescent deposits may originate from macrophages.8,10,14 However , little is known about autofluorescence of the macrophages in the subretinal space . In addition , although immunofluorescent staining of CD68 is frequently used as the cytomarker for macrophages in histologic study of the retina and the choroid , little information has been provided about autofluorescence of the CD68-positive cells in the eye . Thus , information about autofluorescence of the macrophages may help to interpret histologic results . In the present study , we investigated the autofluorescence properties of CD68-positive cells . AlexaFluor-647 was used as a secondary antibody dye to identify macro-phages without interfering with observation of autofluores-cence from the cells . A case with subretinal precipitates in long-standing retinal detachment was reported by Vogt27 in 1938 . In such eyes , cyto - logic study has revealed that macrophages are the dominant cell population in the subretinal fluid.28,29 Coats’ disease is a retinal vascular disease showing yellow golden deposits in the retina30 and bullous retinal detachment occasionally . Numerous macro-phages were confirmed in the subretinal fluid aspirated from the eyes with retinal detachment.21,31 Abnormal FAF in both diseases has not been reported . We noticed hyperautofluorescent deposits corresponding to subretinal precipitates in the eyes with RRD and spotted hyperautofluorescence in the area of retinal detachment caused by Coats’ disease . In the eyes with RRD , hyperautofluo-rescence appeared along subretinal strands . Previous histopatho-logic studies suggested that subretinal strands are composed of macrophage and retinal pigment epithelium.32–35 Macrophages may have a part in the origin of subretinal strands . Three types of cells were morphologically identified in the subretinal fluid from the four eyes in the present study . Immuno - fluorescent staining confirmed that most of the lightly pigmented large cells were CD68-positive macrophages . Pigmented CD68-negative cells , on the other hand , were considered likely to be derived from the retinal pigment epithelium , because of their morphologic characteristics . Since autofluorescence appeared only in these types of cells , they were possible origins of abnormal autofluorescence in the subretinal space . Peak analysis for 50 inclusions consistently showed similar fluorescence properties , suggesting that the inclusions in both types of cells may have similar composition of fluorescent material . Autofluorescent inclusions in both types of cells showed yellow-red peak emissions within the range of 558 to 612 nm Fig. 6 . Consistent with this observation , ex vivo experiments of the human retinal pigment epithelium showed that the peak emission of lipofuscin appeared within the range of 588 to 610 nm.36 Peak emission of lipofuscin varies by age , 25,37 physical condition , 38 and method of extraction . Con-sideration of variation of emission spectra of lipofuscin from these reports suggests that yellow-red emission originates from lipofuscin-like materials in the cells . Previously , lipofuscin was considered to be synthesized in the retinal pigment epithelium as a product of phagocytosis of the photorecep-tor outer segments . Recent reports have suggested that A2E and its derivatives are synthesized in the photoreceptor outer segments before phagocytosis by the retinal pigment epithelium.39 Lipofuscin-like materials could also accumu - I FIGURE 6 . Fluorescence emission fin - late in the macrophages . Specifically , the accumulated outer segment material in phagosomes in the macrophages may generate autofluorescence similar to that in the retinal pig-ment epithelium . Since the former two types of cells showed autofluorescence in the cells , they were considered to be the source of subretinal autofluorescence in part . Autofluorescence was observed in the phagosomal vacuole . Hence , autofluorescent substances may have already been synthesized in shed outer segments before phagocytosis . Recent reports have also raised this possibility.14,39 How-ever , autofluorescence characteristics of shed substances in the subretinal space are still unknown . Further study is needed of this phenomenon . The digested photoreceptor outer segments that may not be properly processed in the macrophages may become lipofus-cin . The possibility of the photoreceptor outer segments being processed into autofluorescent material in the subretinal mac-rophages could not be excluded . CD68-positive cells showed two autofluorescence peaks within the range of 480 to 750 nm . In the present study , green emission peaks of autofluorescence , 505 nm for 457-nm exci-tation and 526 nm for 488-nm excitation , were observed . This emission spectrum was reported to appear in living human eyes.37,40 Flavin adenine dinucleotide FAD is considered to be the main source of the green emission . In the 488-nm emission spectra , the narrow peak appeared around 520 nm Figs . 6C , 6D . A similar peak also appeared on the left shoulder of the broad peak right , straddling 530 to 535 nm along the x-axis in the spectra induced by 458-nm light Figs . 6A , 6B . The flavoprotein signal may be incorporated into this peak.41 Since the green emission was not observed in macrophages in the lung42 or peripheral blood , 43 the fluorophore would be distinctive to macrophages in the subretinal space . Why would this emission spectrum appear only in the inclusions of the macrophages in the subretinal space ? Macrophages accumulate in the outer nuclear layer in regions of ongoing rod cell death after retinal detachment.44 Degenerated photoreceptor cells may be phagocytized by the macrophages . The highest con-centration of FAD is found in the mitochondria of the photo-receptor’s inner segments . As the results of phagocytosis , the mitochondria of the photoreceptor cells may accumulate in the phagosomes of macrophages and show green emission auto-fluorescence . Therefore , the macrophages in the subretinal space in eyes with retinal detachment would be predicted to show that green and yellow autofluorescence originates from lipofuscin-like materials and FAD . Inclusions in cells of the mouse models of age-related macular degeneration showed a spectrum similar to that of our samples.45 The increase in autofluorescence in an elderly population and patients with macular degeneration may reflect autofluorescence from mac-rophages associated with photoreceptor death . Excitation Wavelength nm 0 In this study , we were unable to determine the chemical composition of autofluorescent substances , since the quantity of cells obtained from surgically removed subretinal fluid was lim-ited . Further study is needed to examine whether the subretinal inclusions have the same composition as lipofuscin or FAD . With regard to the origins of CD68-positive cells , we should use the other antibodies that are more specific for tissue mac-rophages . A minority of the retinal pigment epithelium has been reported to be CD68-positive in situ.46 The transforma-tion of the retinal pigment epithelium into the macrophages is assumed to be one source of the subretinal macrophages.47 CD68-positive retinal pigment epithelial cells may look mor-phologically similar to macrophages . Therefore , the CD68-positive cells include the tissue macrophages and the trans-formed retinal pigment epithelium . To determine the contribution of the tissue macrophage to autofluorescence in the subretinal space , more specific staining is needed . How-ever , the broad spectrum of autofluorescence and small amount of the specimens did not allow us to perform multiple staining . Further study of this issue is need . In conclusion , we found that inclusions in the macrophages in the subretinal space emit intense autofluorescence . The spectra of the autofluorescence are very similar to that of the retinal pigment epithelium . Hence , autofluorescent properties of deposits in subretinal space raise the possibility that they are macrophages , and further critical markers are needed for clin-ical assessment as to their identity .

The subjects were 105 patients age range , 1 month–19 years who underwent head MRI . The refractive error was determined in 30 patients , and eyeball shape was expressed numerically by principal components analysis of standardized EFDs . RESULTS . In the first principal component PC1 the oblate-to-prolate change , the proportion of variance total variance in the development of the eyeball shape was 76 % . In all subjects , PC1 showed a significant correlation with age Pearson r 0.314 P 0.001 , axial length AL , r 0.378 P 0.001 , width r 0.200 , P 0.0401 , oblateness r 0.657 , P 0.001 , and spherical equivalent refraction SER , r 0.438 P 0.0146 n 30 . In the group containing patients aged 1 month to 6 years n 49 , PC1 showed a significant correla-tion with age r 0.366 P 0.0093 . In the group contain-ing patients aged 7 to 19 years n 56 , PC1 showed a significant correlation with SER r 0.640 P 0.0063 . CONCLUSIONS . The main deformation pattern in the develop-ment of the eyeball shape from oblate to prolate was clarified by quantitative analysis based on EFDs . The results showed clear differences between age groups with regard to changes in the shape of the eyeball , the correlation between these changes , and refractive status changes . Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci . 2011 52 8585–8591 DOI 10.1167 iovs.11-7221 Ption , eripheral visual input plays an important role in emmetropiza-and the quality of the peripheral visual input may affect and the quality of the peripheral visual input may affect postnatal refractive eye development in patients with myopia . However , changes in the shape of the eyeball during normal and pathologic postnatal eye development are still poorly under-stood.1–3 A previous report described that when the angle on the retinal side of the extrafoveal area changes by 1° , the contrast of the retinal image changes.4 Therefore , a quantitative evaluation of the shape of the eyeball is necessary to understand eye growth during infancy . Until now , few studies have been conducted on the shape of the eyeball itself.1,5–7 Deller et al.5 reported that the dimen - sions of most emmetropic eyes are similar , but that the rate of increase of length is approximately twice that of height and width as myopia increases . Atchison et al.6 suggested that there are considerable individual variations in adult eyes . In general , myopic eyes are elongated relative to emmetropic eyes , with greater growth in length than height and even lesser growth in width . Moreover , some researchers determined that the varia-tions are quantitative by using the Q-value of the shape of the surface of the adult retina.8 Their study results showed that in both emmetropia and myopia , the retinal shape is oblate and that this oblateness is decreased according to the strength of the myopia . The current method of evaluating the shape of the eyeball uses the ratio of the length , radius of curvature , angle of the tangent on the retinal surface , and Q-value.1,4–8 However , limitations in the evaluation of partial features and problems with the inaccuracy and lack of reproducibility are persistent with the use of these evaluation methods . In addition , the Q-value is not suitable for the evaluation of complex shapes , such as the shape of the entire eyeball . Therefore , it is necessary to introduce a method that can mathematically achieve a quantitative evaluation of an outline of the shape of the eyeball . Elliptic Fourier descriptors EFDs , initially proposed by Kuhl and Giardina9 in 1982 , can numerically express any shape with a closed two-dimensional contour . There have been reports show-ing that measurements based on EFDs are helpful in the quanti-tation of plant and animal organ shapes.10–17 Despite its potential , however , there have been relatively few reports on the use of EFDs in shape analysis within the field of clinical medicine . In our study , we used eyeball images taken by magnetic resonance imaging MRI to conduct a quantitative analysis of eyeball shape development based on EFDs . Disclosure K. Ishii , None H.

MATERIALS AND METHODS MRI Validation As our examinations were part of a retrospective study and the MRIs of the infants in that study were taken with the subjects under sedation , it was not possible to fix the visual line on these images . Therefore , a Elliptic Fourier Descriptors Evaluation of Oblateness Statistical Analyses width , age , principal components of standardized EFDs , and oblate-ness . P 0.05 was significant StatView ver . 5.0 SAS , Cary , NC . RESULTS There were 105 patients 105 eyes enrolled in the study they consisted of 55 males and 50 females , ranging in age from 1 month to 19 years 8.47 6.64 years . The AL Pearson r 0.794 P 0.001 and width r 0.754 P 0.001 of the right eyes showed a significant correlation with age . AL and age were closely approximated via a logarithmic approximation . AL Pearson r 0.443 P 0.001 and age r 0.356 P 0.002 showed a significant correlation with oblateness Figs . 4A , 4B . The average of the spherical equivalent refraction SER was 0.68 1.19 D n 30 . The SER showed a significant correlation with AL r 0.695 , P 0.001 , width r 0.547 P 0.0014 , oblateness r 0.423 P 0.0189 , and age r 0.682 P 0.001 . A PCA was performed based on the variance–covariance matrix of the coefficients Fig. 3D . Therefore , each principal component was independent of the shape without the corre-lation . In the PCA of standardized EFDs , the proportion of the variance total variance of the first principal component PC1 was 76.0 % . The proportions of PC2 and PC3 were 7.7 % and 4.1 % , respectively . Figure 5 shows the changes in shape vari-ations within the value range of 2 to 2 SD for the three principal components . The solid line in Figure 5 indicates the average value , and the numerical value is set at 0 in the PCA . The dotted line represents 2 SD , and the dashed line repre-sents 2 SD . Regarding the components following PC4 , their ratio to the eyeball shape was small , and the change was minute . As a result , it was found that PC1 showed a significant correlation with age Pearson r 0.314 P 0.001 as well as with AL r 0.378 P 0.001 , width r 0.200 P 0.0401 , and oblateness r 0.657 P 0.001 Fig. 4C . PC1 also was significantly correlated with SER r 0.438 , P 0.0146 n 30 . PC2 showed a significant correlation with oblateness Pearson r 0.289 , P 0.0027 , but not AL Fig. 4D . PC1 and -2 almost intersected oblateness in the origin Figs . 4C , 4D . Therefore , the eyeball shape of the mean value of PC1 and -2 was approximately spherical . Emmetropization is usually completed by about age 6 years . For those subjects in the group aged 1 month to 6 years n 49 , AL Pearson r 0.733 P 0.001 , width r 0.681 P 0.001 , and oblateness r 0.309 P 0.0301 showed a significant correlation with age . PC1 showed a significant cor-relation with AL r 0.421 P 0.0024 , oblateness r 0.715 P 0.001 , and age r 0.366 P 0.0093 , whereas PC2 only showed a significant correlation with oblate-ness r 0.355 P 0.0118 . The average SER of the younger subjects was 0.09 0.75 D age , 1 month–6 years n 14 . For those subjects aged 7 to 19 years n 56 , AL r 0.459 P 0.003 and width r 0.312 P 0.0187 showed a significant correlation with age . This result seems to reflect the trend of increasing myopia with increasing age within this subject population . PC1 showed a significant correlation with oblateness r 0.524 P 0.001 . The average SER of the young adult subjects was 1.36 1.11 D age , 7–19 years n 16 . PC1 showed a significant correlation with SER r 0.640 P 0.0063 , as did oblateness r 0.534 , P 0.0317 . The correlations between PC1 and -2 in the two age groups and AL , width , oblateness , age , and SER are summarized in Table 2 . Figure 6 shows the scatterplots comparing PC1 with age and SER in the two age groups . DISCUSSION To quantitatively evaluate the patterns of development of the shape of the eyeball , we performed PCA using standardized EFDs from the MRIs of 105 right eyes . The significance of PC1 and -2 in such development , which can be understood by visualizing the aforementioned PCA , is shown in Figure 5 . Such visualization helps us to understand the morphologic meaning of each principal component axis , which is not easy to do in a multivariate analysis.17 In addition , visualization may give us an idea for a novel shape characteristic that has not been evalu-ated so far . PC1 is the width expansion and contraction . The oblateness showed a significant correlation with AL and PC1 Figs . 4B , 4C . In addition , PC1 showed a significant correlation with age . Therefore , the deformation pattern of PC1 in the development of the shape of the eyeball was thought to be a change from oblate to prolate i.e. , a gradual change in the eyeball to a spherical shape from an oblate one and to a prolate shape from a sphere . This result shows the extension of AL to be more dominant than the extension of the width in the development of the eyeball . While the findings associated with myopic changes were consistent with those of many previous re-ports , 1,5–7 few studies have addressed the eyeball transforma-tion pattern in emmetropization , most likely because most evaluations of the eyeball shape of emmetropia have been conducted during later childhood.1,7 PC2 is the posterior pole elongation Fig. 5 . It should be noted that the oblate-to-prolate change can not be evaluated accurately in terms of oblateness alone . However , oblateness was correlated with both PC1 and -2 according to this exami-nation Fig. 4 . Therefore , since oblateness is an evaluation made using the ratio , the true oblate-to-prolate change and posterior pole elongation can not be distinguished . That the difference of the shape variation can not be evaluated by the ratio , but can be distinguished , is one of the advantages of using EFDs in this research . A major advantage of shape analysis based on the principal components of EFDs is that it requires no prior knowledge about morphologic variations of analysis objects . As suggested by PC2 estimated in this study , we were able to discover a novel shape characteristic and measure it via the shape analysis without any prior knowledge . On the other hand , in analyses based on conventional shape characteristics , we should iden-tify characteristics that are appropriate for evaluating analysis objects by referring to previous studies before taking measure-ments e.g. , the ratio of the length and the radius of curva-ture .1,5–7 If the established characteristics are not appropriate for our analysis objects , the shape variations of those objects will not be adequately evaluated . It should be noted that EFDs are not necessarily summarized by PCA alone . Other multivar-iate analysis methods may also be useful to extract significant information for our study objectives from EFDs . To evaluate Data are expressed as Pearson’s correlation coefficient . local shape characteristics , such as the shape of the corneal or retinal surfaces , more precisely , a different approach may be necessary . One example of such an evaluation method is mea-suring the angle of the tangent on the retinal surface and the Q-value.4,8 The main result of this study is that there are clear differ-ences between age groups with regard to changes in the shape of the eyeball , the correlation between these changes , and changes in refractive status . At 6 years of age , when em-metropization is generally complete , PC1 showed a significant negative correlation with age , but not with SER Figs . 6A , 6C . Previous studies have generally assumed that visual signals processed in the fovea dominate the emmetropization process and are the genesis of common refractive errors in children.18 From our results , it was not possible to explain changes in the shape of the eyeball during the emmetropization period by using the refraction value alone . Therefore , the pattern of development of the shape of the eyeball during emmetropiza-tion was thought to be a fixed form change from the oblate shape to the sphere i.e. , oblateness is 0 at approximately 6 years of age Fig. 4A . During the period from age 7 to 19 years , PC1 showed a significant correlation with SER , but not with age Figs . 6B , 6D . To explain the fact that the oblate-to-prolate changes did not correlate with age , we proposed that the main eyeball shape transformation after age 7 is global expansion . In a past report , the shape of the eyeball in adult eyes was almost the same as that described for emmetropia.5 In contrast , an-other past study indicated that myopic eyes in children are typically prolate.1 Our results showed that the development of myopia was due to the oblate-to-prolate change that occurred during the period from 7 to 19 years of age Fig. 6D . Recent studies have suggested that the mouse eye grows in two phases—that is , a period of rapid growth that lasts until postnatal day P 40 to P60 and a period of very slow eye expansion that continues up to P300.19,20 When the evaluation of the crystalline lens and corneal radius of curvature were added , Tkatchenko et al.21 suggested that the mouse eye grows in three phases . In the human eye , AL has a growth pattern approximated in the logarithmic function , with a rapid growth phase up to 6 years of age followed by a slow growth phase from 6 years onward.22,23 Our research results suggest that there is a difference in the development of the shape of the eyeball between these two phases of growth . In addition , the change in the eyeball shape did not essentially correlate with age in the young adult subjects . On the other hand , the change from oblate to prolate was shown in the myopic subjects during the period from 7 to 19 years of age . Therefore , it was suggested that two pattern changes in the eyeball shape exist in the young adult subjects . There were some limitations in this study . One constraint was the possibility that the sample data were biased because the subjects were not prospectively selected randomly . An-other potential limitation is that , since only the horizontal images were examined , the overall height of the eyeball was not known . It is necessary to examine the MRI in a slice of 1 mm or smaller to restructure the sagittal image with the hori-zontal image.24 Because this examination was part of a retro-spective study , it was difficult to obtain other data . In addition , the cases that had an appreciable refractive error were limited . If it had been possible to examine patients by subdividing them into those with emmetropia and those with myopia , a more interesting result might have been obtained . In conclusion , the main deformation pattern in the devel-opment of the shape of the eyeball from oblate to prolate was clarified by quantitative analysis based on EFDs . Our findings suggest that there are differences between age groups with regard to changes in the shape of the eyeball , the correlation between these changes , and changes in refractive status . Pre-vious studies were unable to evaluate complex shapes , such as that of the entire eyeball . This research clearly distinguished two or more deformation patterns of the eyeball shape that could not be distinguished by the aspect ratio i.e. , the oblate-to-prolate change , the posterior pole elongation , and the global expansion . We believe that our new technique based on EDFs , which allows quantitative evaluation of the shape , is effective for research on emmetropization and myopic changes and will ultimately serve as a useful tool in the field of ophthalmology .

21984580	OBJECTIVE—In humans , it is unclear if insulin resistance at the monocyte level is associated with atherosclerosis in vivo . Here we have studied first-degree relatives of patients with type 2 diabetes to investigate whether a reduction in components of the insulin signal transduction pathways , such as the insulin receptor InsR or InsR substrate 1 or 2 IRS1 or IRS2 , or a reduction in genetic modifiers of insulin action , such as the TIMP3 ADAM17 tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 3 A disintegrin and metal-loprotease domain 17 pathway , is associated with evidence of atherosclerosis . RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS—Insulin sensitivity was analyzed through euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp , and sub-clinical atherosclerosis was analyzed through intimal medial thick-ness . Monocytes were isolated through magnetic cell sorting , and mRNA and proteins were extracted and analyzed by quanti-tative PCR and pathscan enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays , respectively . RESULTS—In monocyte cells from human subjects with in-creased risk for diabetes and atherosclerosis , we found that gene expression , protein levels , and tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS2 , but not InsR or IRS1 , were decreased . TIMP3 was also reduced , along with insulin resistance , resulting in increased ectodomain shedding activity of the metalloprotease ADAM17 . CONCLUSIONS—Systemic insulin resistance and subclinical ath-erosclerosis are associated with decreased IRS2 and TIMP3 ex-pression in circulating monocytes . Diabetes 60 3265–3270 , 2011 Ierosclerosis nsulin resistance and compensatory hyperinsulinemia , both consequences of obesity and lipotoxicity , are well-known risk factors for the development of ath-1 . Recent findings from animal models outlined that a combination of insulin resistance and hyper-insulinemia promote changes in the liver’s ability to regulate lipoprotein release , which leads to atherogenic dyslipidemia 2 . Insulin resistance is causative of unbalanced regulation of transcription factors FoxO1 and FoxA2 , which act on the control of VLDL synthesis , whereas hyperinsulinemia may favor lipogenesis through upregulation of transcription factor SREBP2c activity 3 . However , atherosclerosis is also an inflammatory process , and how insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia act in the regulation of innate and adaptive immunity is still debated 4 . Data from experi-mental models have yielded contradictory results . In fact , whereas liver-specific insulin resistance promotes ath-erosclerosis 5 , genetic models of insulin resistance in monocytes , the master regulator of atherosclerotic plaque progression , were found to either promote or prevent lipid accumulation in aortas depending on the strain of mice used 6,7 . Nevertheless , the activation of monocytes and their propensity to differentiate into macrophages contrib-utes to insulin resistance in different tissues as well as ath-erosclerosis 8 . In humans , it is unclear if insulin resistance at the monocyte level is associated with insulin resistance and atherosclerosis in vivo . Here we have used the offspring of patients with type 2 diabetes , a well-characterized model to study how metabolic factors influence vascular homeo-stasis 9,10 , to investigate whether a reduction in compo-nents of the insulin signal transduction pathways , such as the insulin receptor InsR or InsR substrate 1 or 2 IRS1 or IRS2 , or genetic modifiers of insulin action , such as the TIMP3 ADAM17 tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 3 A disintegrin and metalloprotease domain 17 pathway , is associated with evidence of atherosclerosis .

For protein monocyte gene expression data according to tertiles of insulin RESULTS Correlation between insulin resistance , sublinical atherosclerosis , and gene expression in monocytes from offspring of type 2 diabetic subjects . By analyzing clinical characteristics and metabolic parameters of FDRs of type 2 diabetes anthropometric , biochemical , and clini-cal parameters are shown in Table 1 , we found that in-sulin resistance , evaluated as glucose disposal rate M during a euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp , negatively correlates with IMT r 20.575 P , 0.0001 , and di-viding our population into tertiles of insulin resistance assessed by M clamp , we also confirmed that the insulin-resistant tertile has higher IMT values , confirming the validity of this model to study biomarkers linking insulin resistance to atherosclerosis 9,10 Supplementary Fig. 1A and B . We analyzed the mRNA expression levels of InsR , IRS1 , IRS2 , and SirT1 . No correlation was found between levels of InsR , IRS1 , and SirT1 expression with clinical and biochemical parameters data not shown . However , we found in this group of subjects that IRS2 expression cor-related with fasting plasma glucose r 20.34 P , 0.05 , insulin resistance assessed by M r 0.406 P , 0.01 , glycated hemoglobin r 20.36 P , 0.05 , HDL choles-terol r 0.28 P , 0.05 , and IMT r 20.49 P , 0.001 data not shown . We observed that subjects in the lowest tertiles of expression of IRS2 in monocytes were signifi-cantly more insulin resistant and had the highest IMT level Fig. 1A and B and Supplementary Table 2 accordingly those with low IRS2 had increased fasting plasma glucose and HbA1c and reduced levels of HDL cholesterol Fig. 1C–E and Supplementary Table 2 . Next we analyzed the expression of genes relevant for inflammation , such as TNF-a , CCR2 , LOX1 . Similarly , we did not find correlation be-tween levels of gene expression and clinical and biochemical parameters in this group of subjects . Because mRNA ex-pression could not reflect protein regulation at the mem-brane and cytoplasmic level , we analyzed the levels of InsR , IRS1 , and IRS2 in the lowest versus the highest tertiles of insulin resistance . Our analysis confirmed that in cultured monocytes of insulin-resistant subjects , IRS2 protein and tyrosine phosporylation levels were significantly decreased Fig. 2B , whereas no differences were observed for InsR and IRS1 in both protein expression and phopsphorylation Fig. 2A . Interestingly , whereas Akt1 protein levels were similar in the two groups , Akt serine 473 phosphorylation reflected the reduced IRS2 activation Fig. 2C . Analysis of the subjects with lowest IRS2 protein levels in monocytes confirmed that these were significantly more insulin resistant and had the highest IMT level Fig. 2D–H , with results similar to stratification of subjects with IRS2 mRNA levels . DISCUSSION The contradictory results from monocyte-specific InsR knockouts do not provide definitive evidence for a positive or negative role of myeloid insulin resistance in the patho-genesis of diabetes and atherosclerosis in humans 4–7,12 . Here , we observe no correlation between insulin resis-tance , subclinical atherosclerosis , and InsR in monocytes from human subjects . In contrast , expression of IRS2 , the major transduction element of InsR tyrosine kinase in my-eloid cells 13,14 , was correlated to both systemic insulin resistance and subclinical atherosclerosis . Overall , in sub-jects at risk for diabetes , those with insulin resistance and increased IMT carry lower expression of IRS2 in circulating monocytes , suggesting that myeloid-specific insulin resis-tance at the molecular level facilitates the development of atherosclerosis and diabetes . The reduced IRS2 expres-sion might be explained by the exposure to different in-sulin levels , since relative hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance are known to affect IRS2 expression through AkT FoxO1 activation 15 . The inflammatory behavior of circulating monocytes is dependent on several checkpoints 16 . One extracellular factor regulating innate response is TIMP3 , through its ability to restrain release of cytokines and chemokines from the plasma membrane 11,17 . Monocytes from subjects characterized by increased in-sulin resistance and atherosclerosis exhibit reduced mRNA TIMP3 levels . We previously established that TIMP3 is a genetic modifier for insulin resistance in mice it is reduced in atherosclerotic plaques of subjects with type 2 diabetes , as a result of altered SirT1 activity on vascular smooth muscle cells and monocytes 18,19 . Hyperinsulinemia a compensatory response to peripheral insulin resistance is known to increase ADAM10 and ADAM17 activity , the inflammatory metalloproteases that are restrained by TIMP3 , causing increased release of transmembrane pro-teins as soluble factors 20,21 . Among transmembrane proteins with chemokine activity , we found that in off-spring of patients with type 2 diabetes , soluble IL-6 re-ceptor and sVCAM-1 were positively correlated with insulin resistance and markers of atherogenic dyslipide-mia , suggesting a role for these chemokines in the early phases of metabolic inflammation . In conclusion , in monocyte cells from human subjects with increased risk for diabetes and atherosclerosis , we found that gene expression and protein activity of IRS2 , but not InsR , negatively correlates with insulin resistance and atherosclerosis . Moreover , TIMP3 , a natural check-point for inflammation , is reduced along with insulin re-sistance . Our data suggest that the reduction of TIMP3 may increase the release of inflammatory soluble factors generated through the ectodomain shedding activity of metalloproteases such as ADAM17 , a process starting at preclinical levels with release of soluble IL-6 receptor . In-triguingly , data in experimental models suggested that low TIMP3 expression defines a subpopulation of highly in-vasive foam-cell macrophages with increased proliferation and apoptosis , all properties expected to destabilize ath-erosclerotic plaques 22 .

Introduction Cells with characteristics of neural progenitor stem cells have been isolated from the ciliary epithelium CE Coles et al. , 2004 and the neural retina Klassen et al. , 2004 Lawrence et al. , 2007 of the adult human eye , and both cell populations have been considered as potential candidates for cell based therapies to replace or regenerate retinal neurons .

Limb . presence of CE with progenitor characteristics in the rodent retina and the subsequent identification of these cells in the adult human eye , extensive studies have been undertaken on the characteriza-tion and application of these cells to retinal transplantation using rodent models of retina degeneration . Several groups have reported that extended culture of CE causes their differentiation into progenitor-like cells Ahmad et al. , 2000 Fischer and Reh , 2003 MacNeil et al. , 2007 , leading to suggestions that these cells could be used to regenerate visual function . Despite the ciliary epithelium not being part of the neural retina , as a result of these reports CE cells were thought to constitute ‘retinal stem cells’ Tropepe et al. , 2000 . However , despite the high volume of research in this field , no major advances in the use of CE cells for potential therapies have been so far achieved . On the contrary , more recent investigations have provided evidence that CE do not have the retinal neurogenic abilities previously thought . This is supported by findings that spheres formed by CE in vitro contain cells with epithelial proper-ties and limited expression of neuronal markers as compared to neurospheres of neural stem cells Moe et al. , 2009 . Furthermore , other reports have indicated that although cells isolated from the CE could be induced to express low levels of neuronal markers , they retained their epithelial morphology and failed to differentiate into retinal neurons Cicero et al. , 2009 Gualdoni et al. , 2010 , strongly suggesting that CE are not true retinal progenitor cells as previously suggested Ahmad et al. , 2000 . Although recent studies suggest that human CE cells may have a functional capacity following transplantation in vivo , there is a lack of robust data to support this hypothesis Inoue et al. , 2009 . Studies in the zebrafish , known to regenerate retina throughout life , have demonstrated that Müller glia are able to de-differentiate into new retinal neurons in vivo Raymond et al. , 2006 Fimbel et al. , 2007 . Müller glia with stem cell characteristics have been identi-fied in the postnatal chick Fischer and Reh , 2001 and murine retina Ooto et al. , 2004 Karl et al. , 2008 , and more recent studies have shown that human Müller stem cells hMSC can also be isolated and expanded indefinitely in vitro from the adult human retina Lawrence et al. , 2007 . In the light of recent studies that question the true progenicity of CE , at present , there are no comparative studies between pigmented and non-pigmented CE and hMSC in relation to their phenotypic features or their ability to differentiate into retinal neurons in vitro . This study therefore aimed to compare pigmented and non-pigmented CE with Müller stem cells by examining their ability to survive and proliferate in culture and to express markers of neural progenitors and retinal neurons upon growth factors stim-ulation in vitro . Analysis of these features may aid in the under-standing of the true regenerative potential of these two distinct cell populations within the human eye , and the targeting use of these cells as potential therapies to treat retinal degenerative disease , either by transplantation or endogenous induction of proliferation and neural differentiation in situ . 2 . Materials and methods 2.1 . Isolation of Müller cells with stem cell characteristics from the neural retina and of ciliary epithelial cells from the adult human eye Acquisition of human tissue adhered to the tenets of the declaration of Helsinki . Following approval of the local research ethics committee , eyes with consent for research were obtained from Moorfields Hospital Eye Bank between 24 and 48 h post-mortem . After removal of the lens , retina and vitreous were gently dislodged from the eye cup using a pair of small forceps and placed in phosphate buffered saline PBS . Müller stem cells were isolated as previously described Limb et al. , 2002 with some modifications to incorporate isolation of cells from the pigmented and non-pigmented ciliary epithelia . Using a dissecting microscope Nikon SMZ1500 , Nikon , Japan , http www.nikon.com , the pig-mented ciliary epithelial cells were scraped away from the non-pigmented ciliary epithelium using a brush and scalpel and trans-ferred to a tube containing PBS Fig. 1 . The non-pigmented ciliary epithelium was then separated from the neural retina . The non-pigmented ciliary epithelium and neural retina were individually transferred into different tubes containing PBS Fig. 1 . Dispase Invitrogen , Paisley , U.K http www.invitrogen.com was added to reach a concentration of 2.4 U ml and the tubes were incubated at 37 C for 20 min . Hyaluronidase at a final concentration of 0.67 mg ml , SigmaeAldrich , Gillingham , U.K , http www.sigmaaldrich . com and 10 TrypsineEDTA 5 % trypsin , 2 % EDTA , Invitrogen were then added to the dispase solution , the tissue was homoge-nised by vigorous pipetting and incubated for a further 20 min at 37 C. Large tissue debris was then removed by filtration through a gauze mesh . Dissociated cells were pelleted by centrifugation and resuspended in the appropriate cell culture medium . 2.2 . Culture of cells under adherent conditions For adherent monolayer culture , isolated cells from the neural retina or ciliary epithelium were placed in 12.5 cm2 tissue culture flasks Becton , Dickinson and Company BD Biosciences http www.bdbiosciences.com coated with 10 mg cm2 fibronectin Sigma in the presence of 40 ng ml of epidermal growth factor EGF in DMEM medium containing GlutaMAX I Invitrogen and 10 % foetal bovine serum FBS Invitrogen . The original medium was maintained for one week and then replaced weekly . Colonies formed after 2e3 weeks , cells were detached by incubation with TrypsineEDTA for 3 min at 37 C and resuspended in fresh media before plating . When cells reached confluence , they were plated at a concentration of 2.5 105 cells ml and cultured with or without the addition of EGF to the culture medium . 2.3 . Culture of cells under non-adherent conditions Cells isolated from the neural retina and ciliary epithelium were suspended in DMEM medium containing GlutaMAX I , 40 ng ml of EGF and B-27 supplement without Vitamin A Invitrogen . The medium was replaced every two days . After a week culture in suspension , cells were transferred to adherent culture conditions as indicated in the previous section and passaged when confluent . Cells were otherwise passaged weekly and were plated at a dilution of 104 cells ml with the addition of EGF to the culture medium . 2.4 . Assessment of cell proliferation Following detachment with Trypsin EDTA and prior to replat-ing , cells were pooled in 1e2 ml of medium and counted in a Neubauer haemocytometer using the trypan blue exclusion method . Cells were cultured at a concentration of 1 104 cells per well in 6 well plates . The total number of cells was calculated by multiplying the initial number of cells by the number of divisions obtained after each passage . The number of divisions was calcu-lated by dividing the total number of cells obtained at each passage by the number of cells plated . The resulting number was plotted to analyse the total number of cells obtained from each cell preparation . 2.5 . Neural differentiation in vitro For differentiation studies , cells were plated onto flasks coated with basement membrane protein ECM gel from Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm murine sarcoma , Sigma at a concentration of 104 cells ml . Cells were cultured in DMEM medium containing 5 % FCS , fibroblast growth factor 2 FGF2 bFGF-40 ng ml , Sigma and DAPT N- [ N-3,5-Difluorophenacetyl -L-alanyl ] -S-phenylglycine t-butyl ester , Sigma diluted in DMSO to a concentration of 50 mM ml . Media was replaced every 3 days and cells were cultured for a total of 7 days . 2.6 . Immunostaining of cells Cells were fixed in 4 % Paraformaldehyde for 10 min and cry-oprotected with 30 % sucrose .

In vitro characteristics of Müller glial stem cells and ciliary epithelium cultured under non-adherent conditions upon isolation In previous studies , ciliary epithelium CE derived progenitor cells have been cultured in suspension using the B27 supplement Table 1 and serum-free media for 1 week before being transferred to adherent culture conditions to generate cell lines Coles et al. , 2004 . Human Müller glia isolated from the neural retina that become spontaneously immortalized and that express stem cell markers are normally cultured as monolayers immediately after isolation in the presence of FBS Lawrence et al. , 2007 . When cultured under non-adherent conditions in the absence of serum and but in the presence of B27 supplement and EGF , Müller glia isolated from the neural retina did not form spheres Fig. 2A . After one week culture in suspension , retinal Müller cells were transferred to adherent conditions in the presence of 10 % FBS and EGF . Under these conditions a few cells attached to the plate and displayed an elongated morphology Fig. 1B but did not proliferate . When cultured in suspension , primary cells obtained from the pigmented CE did not adhere or form spheres Fig. 2C , whilst non-pigmented CE cells formed spheres within 72 h of culture Fig. 2E . When transferred to adherent conditions , cells from the pigmented CE adhered to the plates and exhibited a flat-tened and aberrant epithelial morphology suggestive of terminal differentiation Fig. 2D . In contrast , cells derived from spheres formed by non-pigmented CE cells , when transferred to adherent cultures exhibited a characteristic epithelial morphology Fig. 2F , proliferated and rapidly reached confluence . These cells continued proliferating in the presence of EGF for up to 20 passages examined . 3.2 . In vitro characteristics of Müller glial stem cells and ciliary epithelium cultured under adherent conditions upon isolation Primary cells isolated from the neural retina , when cultured with medium which contains 10 % FBS and EGF , adhered readily to tissue culture plates coated with fibronectin . Most cells isolated from the neural retina that adhered to the plates appeared bright when viewed under a phase objective , and displayed a character-istic glial morphology after 1 week in culture Fig. 3A . Colonies of proliferating Müller glia appeared after 2e3 weeks in culture under adherent conditions and could be dissociated and further expanded upon removal of the EGF initially added to the primary cultures Fig. 3A . Müller cells that displayed these features became spon-taneously immortalized and exhibited characteristics of stem cells as previously described Lawrence et al. , 2007 . Pigmented and non-pigmented cells from the CE cultured on fibronectin coated plates in the presence of FBS and EGF also attached readily . After 1 and 4 weeks in culture , pigmented CE cells that had originally adhered to the plate did not proliferate Fig. 3B . In contrast , non-pigmented CE cells divided rapidly and showed confluence within 1 week Fig. 3C . During the first 3 weeks in culture , non-pigmented CE divided more rapidly than Müller glia with stem cell characteristics Fig. 3D , but by 4 weeks in culture a large proportion of them had acquired a squamous aberrant morphology with visible stress fibres Fig. 3C and stopped prolif-erating despite the presence of EGF Fig. 3D . Comparison of the cell yields obtained over successive passages of both Müller glia and non-pigmented CE cells cultured under adherent conditions in the absence of EGF showed that although non-pigmented CE cells proliferated soon after isolation , over successive passages they declined in number and by passage 6 they had stopped prolifer-ating . In contrast , Müller glial cells did not start proliferating until 2e3 weeks in culture , but they grew exponentially and continued to proliferate indefinitely to become spontaneously immortalized Fig. 3D . Both spontaneously immortalized Müller and non-pigmented CE cells expressed mRNA coding for genes expressed by retinal pigment epithelium RPE , although stronger expression of markers of RPE cells was observed in CE cells when compared with immortal Müller glia Fig. 4A . These included the tight junction marker ZO-1 , MITF-A microphthalmia-associated transcription factor A , a protein highly expressed in RPE , MERTK a receptor tyrosine kinase involved in phagocytosis of photoreceptor outer segments by RPE and RPE65 an enzyme involved in 11-cis retinal synthesis . In contrast with the marked expression of cellular ret-inaldehyde binding protein CRALBP by Müller cells , non-pigmented CE cells did not express this molecule . The high mRNA expression of RPE cell markers in CE cells and their lack of expression of CRALBP , one of the main Müller glial cell markers , highlights the pigmented epithelial origin of these cells . Immunostaining for RPE65 and cytokeratins by CE further confirmedtheretinalepithelialnatureof theculturednon-pigmented CE cells . In contrast , hMSC did not stain for cytokeratins and only a small number of these cells showed a weak staining for RPE65 Fig. 4B . Staining for glial proteins also revealed differences between the two cell populations . Immortalized Müller glia strongly stained for the hyaluronan receptor CD44 and the glial protein Vimentin , both of which are expressed by Müller glia in situ Nishina et al. , 1997 , contrasting with the lack of glial marker expression by non-pigmented CE cells Fig. 4C . Müller glia that spontaneously became immortalized and non-pigmented CE cell lines grown in the presence of EGF expressed markers of retinal progenitors as determined by RT-PCR analysis Fig. 5A . Both cell types expressed mRNA coding for SHH , PAX6 , CHX10 , SOX2 and NOTCH1 . The intensity of expression of CHX10 , SOX2 and PAX6 amplicons appeared qualitatively lower in CE cells when compared to spontaneously immortalized Müller glia . Immunostaining confirmed the protein expression of progenitor markers in both immortalized Müller glia and non-pigmented CE cells . The majority of immortalized Müller glia stained for the retinal progenitor markers CHX10 , SHH and SOX2 Fig. 5B . Staining for CHX10 and SOX2 was seen in both the cytoplasm and nucleus , and predominant nuclear staining for SOX2 was characteristically observed in immortalized Müller cells . These cells also stained for SHH , supporting suggestions that Müller glia may have the potential to utilize this signalling pathway towards neurogenesis Wan et al. , 2007 . Müller stem cells also stained intensely for the intermediate filament protein Nestin , a marker of neural stem cells Fig. 5B . Only a very small number of CE cells 1e2 % stained for CHX10 , SHH and SOX2 , but expression of Nestin was not observed in CE cells at any time during culture . To compare the potential of spontaneously immortalized Müller glia and non-pigmented CE cells to differentiate into retinal neurons , cells were cultured at low density on Matrigel in the presence of FGF2 . These conditions have been previously shown to promote the differentiation of Müller stem cells Lawrence et al. , 2007 . In addition cells were also cultured in the presence of FGF2 and DAPT , an inhibitor of the Notch pathway which inhibits progenitor cell differentiation during development Nelson et al. , 2007 . Following 7 days in culture , non-pigmented CE cells did not show any real change in morphology Fig. 6A , B . When DAPT was added to these cells in culture , the rate of proliferation was markedly reduced , but cells did not extend neuronal processes Fig. 6C . In contrast , a large proportion of spontaneously immortalized Müller glia cultured under similar conditions for 7 days adopted a neural morphology in the presence of FGF2 Fig. 6E . Presence of DAPT caused a greater number of Müller glia to adopt neural morphology and extend long axon-like processes Fig. 6F . Analysis of protein expression revealed that under differentiating conditions , three different preparations of immor-talized Müller glia expressed BRN3B , a transcription factor expressed by post-mitotic ganglion cell precursors Fig. 6B . However , three different preparations of CE cells did not express this protein under any of the conditions investigated . Investigation of mRNA expression revealed that both CE and immortalized Müller glia expressed the genes coding for the rod photoreceptor markers NRL and rhodopsin when cultured with FGF2 Fig. 6C . These factors are also expressed in situ by cells of the human CE Bertazolli-Filho et al. , 2001 . However , CE cells did not express genes for S-Opsin , which was observed in Müller glia cultured under similar conditions . 4 . Discussion This study shows that profound differences exist between ciliary epithelium and Müller glia with stem cell characteristics from the human eye , both of which have been shown to exhibit neural progenitor characteristics . Although the ciliary body contains pigmented and non-pigmented cells , these cells have not been previously dissociated to assess their proliferative and neurogenic properties . Several studies have reported that progenitor cells can be isolated from the pigmented layer of the ciliary epithelium of rats and mice Tropepe et al. , 2000 Das et al. , 2005 , 2006 Giordano et al. , 2007 . Although progenitor cells have been isolated from the ciliary body in larger mammals including pigs , non-human primates and humans , there have been no objective studies that identify whether cells reported to be progenitor cells are of pigmented or non-pigmented origin Gu et al. , 2007 MacNeil et al. , 2007 . Some reports have suggested that retinal stem cells are rare pigmented ciliary epithelial cells Xu et al. , 2007 and other studies in primates and humans have suggested that a stem cell population may exist in the non-pigmented CE Fischer et al. , 2001 Mayer et al. , 2003 , implying that differences may exist between the ciliary epithelium of rodents and humans , which may be important to identify when considering the potential of these cells to develop therapies using adult stem cells from the human eye . To address these issues , we dissociated pigmented from non-pigmented CE cells from the human eye and cultured them under various conditions . Pigmented CE cells consistently failed to proliferate when cultured either as floating spheres or as monolayers . In contrast , non-pigmented CE cells proliferated when cultured as primary cultures in suspension or under adherent conditions either as primary or secondary cultures . In contrast , Müller glia that became spontaneously immortalized and that display stem cell characteristics did not proliferate when cultured in suspension , and when cultured under adherent conditions , they started forming small colonies after 2e3 weeks and did not depend on the presence of EGF for long term survival and proliferation . This may explain why many attempts at stem cell isolation from the adult human retina have been unsuccessful as most studies have attempted to establish primary cultures of these cells under non-adherent conditions Tropepe et al. , 2000 MacNeil et al. , 2007 . Non-pigmented CE cells proliferate faster during early passages when compared to Müller stem cells . However they proliferate for a long time in culture only when they had been initially cultured as spheres in suspension before adherence to plates . In the presence of EGF they proliferated for up to 22 passages investigated . This suggests that sphere forma-tion may be necessary to de-differentiate these cells before they can be expanded in culture in the presence of EGF . This is sup-ported by evidence that epithelial cells , such as RPE Engelhardt et al. , 2005 and limbal epithelial stem cells Zhao et al. , 2008 de-differentiate and acquire neuronal properties upon initial culture in suspension . Based on the evidence presented in this study and several in vivo studies in small vertebrates Fischer and Reh , 2001 Ooto et al. , 2004 Karl et al. , 2008 , it is possible to suggest that the population of Müller glia isolated from the adult human retina which grow indefinitely in vitro and express markers of neural progenitors constitute true retinal stem cells . In common with adult neural stem cells from the brain Goldman , 2003 , immortal Müller cells possess a glial phenotype and express CRALBP , Vimentin and CD44 , which is in accordance with previous studies that Müller glia and retinal neurons arise from a common multipotent retinal progenitor cell Turner and Cepko , 1987 . Since Müller glia are the last type of cell to be generated in the retina , it is possible that a sub-population of these cells may retain retinal progenitor characteristics , and could therefore de-differentiate , re-enter the cell cycle and form new retinal neurons . Although these cells have shown neurogenic properties in the early postnatal retina of chicks and rodents Fischer and Reh , 2001 Ooto et al. , 2004 Karl et al. , 2008 , no evidence for in vivo neurogenesis has yet been observed in humans despite the presence of these cells in the neural retina . Never-theless , evidence for the presence of Müller glia with stem cell characteristics in the adult human retina provides a theoretical basis for the potential development of endogenous repair strategies . That human Müller stem cells in culture expressed mRNA coding for ciliary epithelium cell markers , it may reflect that observed in situ where they form adherence junctions with the outer segments of photoreceptors Tserentsoodol et al. , 1998 . A sub-population of hMSC also expressed RPE65 , thought to be selectively expressed by RPE and cone photoreceptors . This raises the possibility that RPE65 may be involved in retinoid processing by Müller glia , supported by evidence that these cells are able to process retinoids Kanan et al. , 2008 . Human Müller stem cells in culture also expressed mRNA coding for the transcription factor NRL , a rod photoreceptor gene , as well as Rhodopsin and S-Opsin , well characterized photoreceptor markers . These observations , together with the evidence of RPE65 expression , suggest that by expressing these genes Müller glia has the potential to differentiate into mature photoreceptors . Non-pigmented CE cells expressed a higher level of pigmented epithelial mRNA markers compared to Müller glia , and were found to stain strongly for cytokeratins reflecting their phenotypic epithelial origin . Although non-pigmented CE cells expressed mRNA markers for neural progenitors , they did not express the corresponding proteins as seen with Müller glia . Under conditions known to promote the differentiation of immortalized Müller glia into retinal neurons , CE cells failed to adopt a neural morphology and did not express markers of ganglion cells , although they expressed some mRNA transcripts present in developing rod photoreceptors . These results confirm a previous demonstration that CE cells may not constitute true retinal stem cells Cicero et al. , 2009 . In contrast to other studies that reported positive staining for Nestin and SOX2 in CE cells Goldman , 2003 Coles et al. , 2004 , we did not detect Nestin protein expression by CE cells and only a small minority of these stain for SOX2 . However , no other studies have correlated immunostaining with gene expression , and many reports have shown that spheres may non-specifically stain for various factors and this may account for these differences . In addition , it has been suggested that neurosphere culture may affect cell proliferation and the positional cues to which cells are exposed Jensen and Parmar , 2006 , thus accounting for the possibility of non-specific staining previously reported by CE spheres . From these observations , it is reasonable to conclude that CE cells have limited proliferative ability and lack true neurogenic potential . On this basis we believe that these cells do not constitute a suitable cell population for developing therapies to treat retinal disease . In contrast , Müller glia that become spon-taneously immortalized and that exhibit stem cell properties in vitro may constitute a potential source of retinal neurons and fulfil the characteristics of true stem cells due to their proliferative and neurogenic ability . These cells may therefore constitute a viable target to develop therapeutic strategies by either cell transplantation or by induction of endogenous repair mechanisms .

To identify sex-related differences and age-related changes in individual retinal layer thicknesses in a population of healthy eyes across the lifespan , using spectral domain optical coherence tomography SD-OCT . METHODS . In seven institutes in Japan , mean thicknesses of the retinal nerve fiber layer RNFL , ganglion cell layer GCL , inner plexiform layer IPL , inner nuclear layer INL , outer plexi-form layer OPL , outer nuclear layer ONL , photoreceptor inner segment IS , and photoreceptor outer segment OS were measured using SD-OCT with a new automated segmen-tation protocol in 256 healthy subjects . RESULTS . Interoperator coefficients of variability for measure-ments of each layer ranged from 0.012 to 0.038 . The RNFL , GCL , IPL , and INL were thinnest in the foveal area , whereas the OPL ONL and OS were thickest in this area . Mean thicknesses of the INL and the OPL ONL were significantly greater in men P 0.002 and 0.001 , respectively . However , mean RNFL thickness was greater in women P 0.006 . Thicknesses of the RNFL , GCL , IPL , INL , and IS correlated negatively with age . Thickness of the OPL ONL was not correlated with age , and thickness of the OS correlated positively with age . Inner retinal RNFL GCL IPL thickness over the whole macula correlated negatively with age P 0.001 , but outer retinal OPL ONL IS OS thickness did not . Thicknesses of layers did not correlate with axial length . CONCLUSIONS . Macular layer thicknesses measured on SD-OCT images in healthy eyes showed significant variations by sex and age . These findings should inform macular layer thickness analyses in SD-OCT studies of retinal diseases and glaucoma .

Recently , advances in OCT have allowed measurement of the thickness of specific retinal layers , which is useful for diagnosing and monitoring pathologic changes in various ocular diseases.1–10 Studies have found that the thick-ness of the photoreceptor layer , measured by ultra–high-reso-lution OCT , is correlated with the severity of photoreceptor loss associated with decreased visual acuity in retinitis pigmen-tosa.1,2 Studies using spectral-domain SD OCT showed that the thickness of the outer nuclear layer ONL in the fovea correlates with visual acuity in eyes with central serous chori-oretinopathy , 3,4 polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy , 5 and epiretinal membrane.6,7 Studies in which a layer segmentation algorithm was used with time-domain TD OCT and SD-OCT to automatically measure the combined thickness of the three innermost retinal layers retinal nerve fiber layer [ RNFL ] ganglion cell layer [ GCL ] inner plexiform layer [ IPL ] , which are the most susceptible to glaucomatous damage , differed in the thickness of these layers between glaucomatous and healthy eyes.8,9 In a study using SD-OCT , GCL thickness was found to be reduced in patients with type 1 diabetes who had no or minimal diabetic retinopathy.10 As these studies demon-strate , measuring the thickness of individual retinal layers is becoming a powerful tool for assessing and monitoring changes in the macula resulting from retinal diseases , glau-coma , and optic neuropathy . The usefulness of these technologies is predicated on an understanding of the normal anatomy of the many layers in the macula , each of which has its own normal 3D shape and may be affected in various ways by disease . However , to our knowl-edge , no normative database exists against which thickness maps of individual retinal layers in diseased eyes can be com-pared . Macular thickness measurements have been reported in healthy eyes by TD-OCT and SD-OCT11–28 and by three-dimen-sional raster scans.11–15 Earlier studies using TD-OCT16–22 or SD-OCT23–28 in healthy eyes reported changes in the macular Investigative Ophthalmology Visual Science , November 2011 , Vol . 52 , No. 12 Copyright 2011 The Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology , Inc . profile in relation to factors such as age , sex , and axial length . It was only recently , however , that an algorithm was devel-oped for SD-OCT that allows for measurement of the thickness of each macular layer in each of the nine areas of the macula.29 This development provides the unique opportunity to profile the 3D anatomy of individual macular layers . In this study , we used SD-OCT with the new automated retinal layer segmentation algorithm29 and a raster scanning protocol to measure the thickness of individual retinal layers in 256 healthy eyes of men and women in six age groups , with the objective of developing a database for assessing and mon-itoring intraretinal pathologies when using SD-OCT instru-ments . We evaluated mean measurements in nine macular areas sectors on the basis of areas defined in the Early Treat-ment Diabetic Retinopathy Study ETDRS and evaluated the results according to subject age , sex , and axial length of eyes . SUBJECTS METHODS AND Subjects SD-OCT Measurements of the “inner ring” 1 to 3 mm from the center of the fovea and the “outer ring” 3 to 6 mm from the center of the fovea Fig. 2 . Statistical Analysis RESULTS Four hundred sixty-four subjects were initially enrolled in the study , but 189 were excluded , and acceptable OCT images were not obtained in 19 subjects . Thus , 256 subjects 130 men [ 51 % ] , 126 women [ 49 % ] ranging in age from 20 to 77 years mean , 50.5 years were included in the analysis . When both eyes qualified for the study , one eye was randomly chosen for inclusion . As shown in Table 1 , men and women were equally represented in each age group . Differences between them in mean age and axial length were not significant P 0.556 and P 0.080 , respectively . Table 2 shows the reproducibility of measurements of ret-inal layer thickness . For measurements over the entire macular area , CVs ranged from 0.012 to 0.038 for measurements of various layers , ICCs ranged from 0.931 to 0.988 . Mean retinal layer thicknesses for all subjects are shown in Figure 3 and Table 3 . Thickness maps Fig. 3 show vertical symmetry for all retinal layers . In the central fovea , the RNFL , GCL , IPL , and INL became so thin that their thicknesses were nonmeasurable , and the OPL ONL and OS were at their thick-est . The IS displayed nearly uniform thickness in all areas . Areas of maximal thickness of the GCL , IPL , and INL formed circular or “C” patterns in the parafovea . In the inner ring , mean thicknesses of the GCL and INL in the nasal quadrants were significantly greater than in the temporal quadrants Table 3 P 0.001 for both . Mean thicknesses of the INL and OPL ONL were signifi-cantly greater in men than in women P 0.002 and P 0.001 , respectively Fig. 4 , Table 4 . However , in women , the mean RNFL thickness was greater P 0.006 , especially in the peripheral macula outer ring P 0.001 Fig. 4 , Table 4 . As Figure 5 shows , thicknesses of the RNFL , GCL , IPL , INL , and IS decreased with increasing age . The thickness of the OPL ONL in the peripheral macula did not vary with age however , foveal thickness increased with increasing age , as did OS thickness . Table 5 shows that after adjusting for axial length , the thicknesses of the RNFL , GCL , IPL , INL , and IS correlated negatively with age . Age-related losses in the thicknesses of the RNFL , GCL , IPL , INL , and IS over the whole macula were 0.05 , 0.07 , 0.05 , 0.03 , and 0.05 m year , respec-tively . OS thickness correlated positively with age , as did the thickness of the OPL ONL in the central foveal sector . Sup-plementary Table S1 http www.iovs.org lookup suppl doi 10.1167 iovs.11-8388 -DCSupplemental shows that after ad-justing for axial length , the thicknesses of the GCL , IPL , INL , and IS correlated negatively with age in men and women , whereas RNFL thickness correlated negatively and OS thick-ness correlated positively with age only in women . Figure 6 and Table 6 show thicknesses of the combined inner retinal layers RNFL , GCL , and IPL , known as the gan-glion cell complex GCC , versus the outer retinal layers ORL consisting of the OPL ONL , IS , and OS . After adjusting for axial length , GCC thickness over the whole macula correlated negatively with age P 0.001 , but ORL thickness did not Table 6 .

DISCUSSION Several studies of normal macular layer thickness have used TD-OCT measurements33–35 however , the acquisition of accu-rate 3D macular measurement data using TD-OCT is limited by the imaging speed and axial resolution of these instru-ments . Using TD-OCT , mean macular layer thickness is cal-culated based on only six radial linear scans of 6 mm each , requiring interpolation to fill in the nonimaged areas . SD-OCT instruments allow 43 to 125 faster image acquisi-tion and provide approximately double the axial resolution 3–7 m and a higher signal-to-noise ratio than the Stratus OCT . These features provide images on which measuring fine details of macular structures is possible , specifically the thicknesses of individual retinal layers . Loduca et al.36 re-cently reported the use of Spectralis Heidelberg Engineer-ing , Heidelberg , Germany , a type of SD-OCT instrument , to map the thicknesses of retinal layers on 19 horizontal B scans in 15 healthy eyes . We used a different type of SD-OCT instrument , together with 3D raster scanning , to measure retinal layer thickness in a large population of sex-matched , age-stratified groups . The clinical usefulness of any imaging system depends on the reproducibility of the measurements it is used to obtain . In this study , interoperator CVs ranged from 0.012 to 0.038 , and ICCs ranged from 0.931 to 0.988 . In a study of 43 healthy eyes using the same SD-OCT system with a multilayer segmentation algorithm , intervisit CVs ranged from 0.021 to 0.044 Hangai M , et al . IOVS 2010 51 ARVO E-Abstract 221 . These results indicate that the SD-OCT system with the multilayer segmen-tation algorithm permits reliable measurement of the thickness of each retinal layer . Mean Retinal Layer Thickness The mean values we obtained for retinal layer thickness were similar to those obtained in other studies of healthy eyes.36–38 In our study , the mean RNFL thickness averaged over the whole macula was 32.2 3.7 m , compared with the values reported by Loduca et al. 36 7 m 36 and Kotera et al. 29 4 m , 37 who also used SD-OCT . Similar small differences can be found among RNFL thicknesses measured in studies that used TD-OCT.8 Furthermore , the thicknesses of the GCL , IPL , and INL in our study Table 3 were comparable to measurements of GCL , IPL , and INL thicknesses averaged over all ETDRS segments , excluding the central fovea in the TD-OCT study.8 Using TD-OCT , Ishikawa et al.33 found a mean of 51 4 m for OPL thickness and 94 7 m for mean outer retinal complex ONL IS OS thickness the total thickness of these layers 145 m was slightly greater than what we obtained 138.5 7.8 m . We believe this can be accounted for by the differences in study populations and imaging systems . Standard SD-OCT images acquired along the optical axis typically do not show axons of the photoreceptor nuclei or Henle’s fiber layer HFL . Recently , Lujan et al.39 and Otani et al.40 were able to identify the HFL by varying where the SD-OCT beam was directed through the pupil . With this ma-neuver , they were able to view reflected light from the HFL when the beam was directed eccentrically , toward the side of the fovea opposite the side of beam entry . When they included the HFL in measurements of ONL thickness , these measure-ments increased by 52 % .39 These results demonstrate that accurate measurement of ONL thickness is challenging . Thus , in the study we report here , we did not evaluate ONL thickness alone instead we measured the combined thickness of the OPL and ONL . We found that the GCL and INL were thinner in the temporal sector than in the nasal sector within the inner ring 1–3 mm from the center of the fovea but not within the outer ring 3–6 mm from the foveal center . The circular or “C”-like shapes of the GCL , IPL , and INL in the parafovea were similar to the findings of a histologic study wherein the spatial distribution of ganglion cells was quantified in whole mounts of healthy hu-man retinas.41 Within the central fovea , ganglion cell density was the highest in a horizontally oriented ellipse 0.4 to 2.0 mm from the foveal center . The number of ganglion cells was lower in the temporal sector than in the nasal sector within 0.5 to 2 mm of the foveal center , but the difference was minimal within 2 to 3 mm of the foveal center , which may explain the thinner GCL and INL in the temporal sector than in the nasal sector within the inner ring 0.5–1.5 mm from the center of the fovea but not within the outer ring 1.5–3 mm from the foveal center . We also found that peak INL thickness occurred in the same area as peak GCL thickness thus , we speculate that the densities of bipolar cells , amacrine cells , horizontal cells , and Mu ¨ller cells might be high in these areas . Numerous studies have found that total retinal thickness is greater in the nasal quadrant than in the temporal quadrant and greater in the ETDRS inner ring than in the outer ring.11,13– 15,17,19–28 Thickness maps for each retinal layer in the present study clearly show that the RNFL is vertically but not horizon-tally symmetrical . This asymmetry of the RNFL probably ac-counts for the finding that total macular thickness in the outer ring is less symmetrical than in the inner ring . Differences due to Sex Several studies have reported sex-related differences in total macular thickness and in thicknesses in some sec-tors.13,15,19,20,25,28 For example , mean central foveal sector B GCL , C IPL , D INL , E thickness was found to be significantly greater in men than in women , and mean retinal thicknesses in all quadrants of the inner ring and in the temporal quadrant of the outer ring were found to be significantly greater in men than in women.28 This study is the first to identify sex-related differences in the thicknesses of individual retinal layers . We found that the INL and OPL ONL were significantly thicker in men , whereas the macular RNFL was thicker in women . In the central foveal sector , ETDRS inner ring , and temporal quadrant of the outer ring , where the RNFL is relatively thin , the sex-related differ-ence in INL or OPL ONL thickness may be responsible for the observed sex-related difference in total retinal thickness . Changes with Age OCT measurements have demonstrated a negative correlation between age and total retinal thickness , 16,21,22,25 and one study found that in the fovea , mean thickness was not corre-lated with age , but in 5 of 8 extrafoveal sectors , thickness correlated negatively with age.28 Using SD-OCT HD-OCT , Song et al.25 studied 198 eyes and reported that average extra-foveal retinal thicknesses decreased as mean subject age in-creased , although no significant correlation was found be-tween mean central foveal sector thickness and age . In this study , the thicknesses of the RNFL , GCL , IPL , INL , and IS correlated negatively with age . However , the thickness of the OPL ONL was not correlated with age , and the thick-ness of the OS correlated positively with age . Of the three primary retinal layers in the central fovea , with increasing age , the OPL ONL did not change in thickness , the OS thickened , and the IS thinned . The varying effects of aging on the layers of the fovea indicated why previous studies found no overall statistically significant correlations be-tween aging and foveal retinal layer thickness.22,25,28 Simi-larly , our findings support previous studies showing that total retinal thickness in extrafoveal regions is negatively correlated with age.16,21,22,25,28 Among the retinal layers we examined , only the thickness of the OS was positively cor-related with age in the inner and outer ring . Aging has been shown to be associated with loss of neurons in the inner retina.42–46 Histologic studies showed age-related losses of 0.3 % to 0.6 % of retinal neurons per year , 42,43 whereas age-related thinning of the RNFL occurs at a lower rate of 0.2 % per year.45 Most OCT studies report similar findings , including decreases in the mean circumpapillary or peripapil-lary RNFL thickness with age.16,22,44–46 We found a linear decrease in macular RNFL and GCL thickness with age , with negative slopes of 0.05 and 0.07 m year 0.2 % and 0.2 % year , respectively . We also found age-related thinning of other inner retinal layers IPL and INL , suggesting that aging is associated with loss of other neurons or glial cells in the INL . Fewer studies have examined the effects of aging on the outer retina . In one study , 28 the mean thickness of the central fovea , which is composed primarily of outer retinal layers , was not correlated with age , whereas another study found a slight increase in thickness of the central foveal sector with increas-ing age.22 In this study , the thickness of the outer retinal layers did not change in the inner ring and outer ring but was positively correlated with age in the central foveal sector . Taken together , these findings indicate that retinal thickness in the outer fovea does not decrease with age . This is supported by histologic findings . Curcio et al.47 counted cones and rods in 27 whole-mounted retinas from donors 27 to 90 years old with macroscopically healthy fundi and reported that changes in the cone density showed no consistent relationship with age , whereas rod density decreased by 30 % from the youngest to the oldest specimen . Thus , foveal thickness may not de-crease because of the following reasons foveal cones remain stable with aging subclinical vitreous traction has positive effects on the fovea the OS thickens because of decreased retinal pigment epithelium phagocytosis with age . Effect of Axial Length We found no correlation between total retinal thickness and age-adjusted axial length for any ETDRS sector . No previous study examined this correlation by sector , and results were contradictory in studies that examined total retinal thickness over the entire macula . For example , a study that included subjects with high myopia found a correlation between total macular thickness and axial length , 18,19,25 but a study that excluded highly myopic eyes28 and studies that included highly myopic eyes48,49 found no significant correlation . Con-troversial results have also been reported for correlations be-tween peripapillary RNFL thickness and axial length or refrac-tive error.45,46,50–52 Several differences in study design could have contributed to these inconsistent results , such as inclu-sion of eyes with high myopia and adjustment for age or correct magnification . The relationship between retinal layer thickness and axial length should be investigated further , es-pecially for subjects with highly myopic eyes . Study Limitations Although several authors have measured OS thickness as the distance between the IS OS and the RPE , 5,36,53 OS thickness may be between the IS OS and OS tip line . Thus , the OS thickness defined in the present study and the true OS thick-ness might differ . RPE and OS tip lines are difficult to identify independently in some subjects , and OS thickness might be underestimated in them . Another limitation of our study is that the 3D-OCT raster-scan protocol may not cover the entire ETDRS region in some eyes the ETDRS sectors are encompassed in a 6-mm diameter circle , whereas the raster scan is a 6 6-mm square area . Thus , even if the central fovea and the central sector of the ETDRS layout match exactly , the corners of the outer ring may be omitted . Similar problems are encountered when obtaining measurements with the Stratus TD-OCT . A further limitation was that although we studied a large number of people evenly distributed by age and sex , all sub-jects were Japanese adults without high myopia results could differ among other population groups or groups with high myopia . Specifically , foveal and extrafoveal thickness differ-ences between different ethnic groups20 and between eyes with and without high myopia19 have been reported . Thus , studies similar to ours on the relationships between macular layer thickness and age , sex , and axial length in other ethnic groups and among those with high myopia would add clarity . In summary , 3D macular layer dimensions in a large healthy population were profiled using an SD-OCT instrument . Our findings indicate that the effects of sex and age on macular dimensions vary by retinal layer these subject variables must be considered while interpreting macular layer thickness data . Evaluation of the thickness of the ONL or photoreceptor layer may be used to predict visual prognosis in various macular diseases , and these thicknesses may also be used for monitor-ing the progression of retinitis pigmentosa . GCL thickness may be used to diagnose early-stage glaucoma and to evaluate the efficacy of medical and surgical treatments for glaucoma . Our findings provide basic information to facilitate macular layer thickness analysis using SD-OCT instruments for assessing var-ious retinal diseases and glaucoma . References chorioretinopathy .

21998398	RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS—We used HLA-A*02 01 tetramers complexed to PPI peptides to enumerate circulating PPI-specific CD8+ T cells in patients and characterize them using mem-brane markers and single-cell PCR . 3299 , 2011 Tthatthediabetes ype 1 is an autoimmune disease driven by activation of lymphocytes against pan-creatic b-cells . Although the successive steps control the activation of autoreactive lym-phocytes have been extensively studied in animal models , the disease process remains ill defined in human type 1 di-abetes 1 . In mice , type 1 diabetes is transferred into naïve recipients by T cells , is prevented by antibodies that target T-cell differentiation , and fails to develop when key genes in T-cell differentiation or activation are nonfunctional . In humans , T cells—especially CD8+ T cells—are predominant within insulitis in most observations 2–5 . Occurrence of type 1 diabetes in a patient deprived of B lymphocytes further underscores the role of T cells 6 . An unexpected feature is the high recurrence level of autoimmunity in long-standing type 1 diabetic patients . Rapid diabetes recurrence is seen in type 1 diabetic recipients of isograft from a nondiabetic twin , accompanied by an almost exclusive islet CD8+ T cell in-filtration 7 . b-Cell–specific T cells thus seem to maintain immune memory for years after type 1 diabetes onset . However , the differentiation patterns of autoreactive T cells once diabetes is diagnosed remain largely unknown . Insulin has been ascribed a key antigenic role in type 1 diabetes . Altered diabetes development in proinsulin 12 2 or 22 2 NOD mice makes a strong case for the primary role of insulin in the NOD mouse 8–10 . In humans , insulin and proinsulin are common targets of autoantibodies and T cells in prediabetic and diabetic individuals . Insulin autoanti-bodies are the first to be detected in children at risk for type 1 diabetes and carry a high positive predictive value for di-abetes in siblings of patients 11 . A restricted region of pro-insulin located in the B chain and adjacent C-peptide clusters has epitopes that are recognized by CD8+ T cells 12–16 . Other epitopes are located within the A chain , the C-peptide and C-peptide–B chain junction 14 , and preproinsulin PPI leader sequence 13,17,18 , including residues excised dur-ing insulin processing . PPI-reactive CD8+ T cells have mostly been observed in recent-onset type 1 diabetic patients 12,13 . However , some peptides , in particular peptides located in the insulin B chain , allow the detection of interferon-g IFN-g –producing CD8+ T cells in long-standing patients who have been treated with insulin for decades 12 . Most studies have used IFN-g enzyme-linked immunospot ELISpot assays to characterize autoreactive CD8+ T cells 12–15 . More recently , HLA class I tetramers TMrs have identified CD8+ T cells expressing a T-cell receptor specific for HLA class I–restricted peptides , independently of cytokine production 13,18,19 . Developing T-cell assays is a major challenge in human type 1 diabetes . It is therefore expected to help in identifying epitopes recognized by T cells and to pave the way toward immunotherapy to restore tolerance to b-cells . New T-cell technologies are expected to allow defining autoreactive T-cell differentiation programs and characterizing autoimmune responses in comparison with physiologically appropriate immune responses . Here , we used TMrs to detect insulin-reactive CD8+ T cells in type 1 diabetic patients and characterize their functional profile in comparison with cytomegalovirus CMV -specific CD8+ T cells . Remarkably , CD8+ T cells detected in recent-onset type 1 diabetic patients are specific for leader sequence peptides , especially PPI6–14 . The detection of CD8+ T cells against an insulin B-chain peptide in patients with established disease raises the hypoth-esis that insulin therapy may also contribute to expansion of autoreactive CD8+ T cells . RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS TABLE 1 Characteristics of patients and control subjects RESULTS Insulin-specific CD8+ T cells are detected in type 1 diabetic patients . PPI peptides are recognized by CD8+ T cells from type 1 diabetic patients using IFN-g ELISpot 12–15 , which , methodologically , restricts recognition to TABLE 2 HLA-A*0201 peptide TMrs PPI peptides Sequence score score MFI PDHase 208–216 TLLEIENAV 26 1,055 na CMV pp65 495–503 NLVPMVATV 30 160 1.5 MFI , mean fluorescent intensities na , not available T1D , type 1 a functional subset of T cells , precluding characterization of their differentiation stage . To characterize PPI-specific CD8+ T cells independently of their function , we prepared HLA-A*0201 PE-labeled TMrs complexed with previously defined PPI peptides A2 PPI Table 2 12–15 . Stable TMrs were obtained with peptides that showed a percent MFI .0.5 in HLA-A2 stabilization assays Table 2 . HLA-A2 TMrs complexed with CMV peptide pp65495–503 A2 CMV TMrs and PDHase208–216 A2 PDHase TMrs were used as positive and negative controls , respectively . A2 PPI TMrs+ CD8+ T cells were detected Fig. 1A–E in 35 49 type 1 diabetic patients 71.43 % . Detection thresholds for each individual TMr+ were set at the 95th percentile of values obtained in controls . Percentages of TMr+ CD8+ T cells above 95th percentile of controls were considered positive . Table 2 . No CD8+ T cells were stained with A2 PDHase TMrs Fig. 1F or in absence of TMrs Fig. 1G . As expected , more cells were often stained with HLA-A2 CMV TMrs than with A2 PPI TMrs Fig. 1H . Significant differences were observed among recent-onset , long-standing type 1 diabetic patients , and control subjects in the frequencies of TMr+ CD8+ T cells specific for PPI leader sequence peptides PPI6–14 , PPI15–24 , and B-chain peptide PPI33–42 B9–18 Fig. 2A . Percentages of CD8+ T cells specific for leader sequence peptide PPI2–11 , B chain peptides PPI30–39 , PPI34–42 , and PPI42–51 , and A chain peptide PPI101–109 did not differ significantly among groups , but few individual responses were seen against these peptides Fig. 2A and Supplementary Table 1 . There was no signif-icant difference in PPI-specific CD8+ T cells between healthy controls and type 2 diabetic patients , including with insulin-treated Type 2 diabetic patients data not shown , and in CMV-specific CD8+ T cells between type 1 diabetic patients and control subjects Fig. 2A . The number of individuals whose TMr+ frequencies were $ 95th percentile of control subjects was different between recent-onset patients and control subjects for PPI6–14 TMr+ cells 8 25 , 32.0 % P , 0.03 and PPI15–24 8 25 , 32.0 % P , 0.03 but not for PPI33–42 7 25 , 28.0 % P 0.06 and between long-standing type 1 diabetic patients and control subjects for PPI33–42 12 24 , 50.0 % P , 0.002 but not for PPI6–14 9 24 , 37.5 % P 0.35 and PPI15–24 7 24 , 29.2 % P 0.055 . In a healthy control subject , a high 0.14 % frequency of PPI6–14–specific CD8+ T cells was observed Fig. 2A . Assay reliability was calculated from values obtained from two assays performed in two different samples collected at median intervals of 3 days following diagnosis range 2–90 days in the same individuals using PPI6–14 , PPI15–24 , PPI33–42 , and CMV pp65495–503 TMrs . Differences of up to 60.038 , 0.042 , 0.060 , and 0.186 % were observed for PPI6–14 , PPI15–24 , PPI33–42 , and CMV pp65495–503 TMrs , respectively . Mean dif-ferences represent interassay mean errors and intervals acceptable errors . There is good interassay agreement for PPI6–14 , PPI15–24 , and PPI33–42 peptides , each value being included in the error interval , which is # 0.05 Fig. 2B . Overall , 68 % of recent-onset and 83.3 % of long-standing type 1 diabetic patients had detectable PPI-specific CD8+ T cells above the 95th centile of control subjects . Responses were observed against at least two peptides in 44.9 % of patients 22 49 , including 32.6 % 16 49 who showed a re-sponse to either PPI6–14 , PPI15–24 , PPI33–42 . In long-standing patients who stained positive for A2 PPI TMrs , mean diabetes duration was 6.5 years range 3–25 for PPI6–14 peptide , 14.4 years 3–39 for PPI15–24 peptide , and 10.7 3–39 for PPI33–42 peptide . Basal C-peptide values were available in 11 19 patients in whom increased A2 PPI33–42 TMr+ CD8+ T cells TMr+ patients were detected and 7 30 patients in whom A2 PPI33–42 TMr+ CD8+ T cells were in the basal range TMr2 patients . Although differ-ences between both groups were not significant , lower C-peptide values were observed in TMr+ patients median 0.07 6 0.09 nmol L range 0.01–0.27 than in TMr2 ones median 0.22 6 0.19 nmol L range 0.01–0.59 P 0.07 Fig. 3A . Moreover , an inverse correlation was observed between percentages of A2 PPI33–42 TMr+ CD8+ T cells detected and fasting C-peptide values r 20.63 P 0.05 Fig. 3B . PPI-specific CD8+ T cells express central memory cell markers . Upon antigen encounter , CD8+ T cells express differentiation programs that imprint their homing , sur-vival , activation , and functions . Detection of circulating TMr+ CD8+ T cells allows characterizing membrane markers , especially homing and signaling markers that discriminate effector and memory cells from naïve cells . PPI-specific CD8+ T cells were gated to evaluate percent TMr+ cells and define Fig. 4 30 CD45RA+CCR7+ naïve T cells TN , CD45RA2 CCR7+ central memory T cells TCM , CCR72CD45RA2 effector memory T cells TEM , and CCR72 CD45RA+ effector memory T cells TEMRA Fig. 4A and B . Significant differences were seen in the distribution of CMV-specific and PPI-specific CD8+ naïve and memory T cells between type 1 diabetic patients and control subjects using the Kruskal-Wallis test , but not between recent-onset and long-standing type 1 diabetic patients Fig. 4C . In recent-onset and long-standing type 1 diabetic patients , 31.5 and 32.0 % TN PPI-specific CD8+ cells were detected , re-spectively , whereas these cells were almost undetectable among CMV-specific T cells . Similarly , PPI-specific TCMs represented 25.4 and 29.8 % of CD8+ T cells in the two re-spective type 1 diabetic populations , whereas they repre-sented only 15.6 % of CMV-specific CD8+ T cells P 0.0071 .

B Each symbol represents the correlation between the percentage of PPI33–42–specific CD8+ T cells and basal C-peptide levels detected in type 1 diabetic patients in whom increased A2.1 PPI33–42 TMr+ CD8+ T cells were detected . A negative correlation P £ 0.005 , Spearman r 20.63 was observed . In contrast , PPI-specific TEM and TEMRA were under-represented in recent-onset 8.19 % and long-standing 12.1 % patients , as compared with CMV-specific TEM and TEMRA CD8+ T cells 50.47 and 29.97 % , respectively . There was no difference in distributions of PPI6–14– , PPI15–24– , PPI33– –specific CD8+ T cells . Altogether , these data show that PPI-42 specific CD8+ memory T cells are predominantly TN , TCM , and TEM cells , whereas the majority of CMV-specific CD8+ T cells are TEM and TEMRA cells . We observed no correla-tion between diabetes duration and percentage of PPI-specific CD8+ TN or TCM T cells on long-standing type 1 diabetic patients data not shown . PPI-specific CD8+ T cells show characteristic CD8+ T cells gene expression programs . Cell surface phenotypes often fail to ascribe functional attributes to memory CD8+ T cells 25,31,32 . To address how differentiation programs are established at clinical onset and in long-standing type 1 diabetes , we studied 18 genes coding for inflammatory che-mokines , cytokines , cytotoxic molecules , and receptors in-volved in CD8+ T-cell responses . Gene expression was evaluated in TMr+ CD8+ T cells and nonpurified TMr+ CD8+-naïve and central memory cells . Cells were obtained by pu-rifying CD8+ T cells , then sorting TMr+ cells from patients in whom a minimum of 0.05 % TMr+ CD8+ T cells were de-tected . In these patients , the percentage of cells expressing the CD3e gene was 82.06 6 14.35 % , in contrast with patients who did not reach this threshold 16.50 6 8.96 % . Gene expression profiles were heterogeneous between single cells carrying the same peptide specificity , but a significant percentage of single cells coexpressed genes involved in the same functional program Fig. 5 . Gene expression in PPI-specific Fig. 5A and CMV-specific Fig. 5B CD8+ T cells was different . Figure 5A illustrates a representative subject R18 displaying 0.19 % A2 PPI6–14 TMr+ CD8+ T cells of which only 4.3 % coexpressed Pfr and Gzma or Gzmb , none coexpressed Ccl5 coding for RANTES and Mip1b , but 40 % expressed Ccr7 . Opposite profiles were seen in A2 CMV-specific CD8+ T cells . In patient L9 Fig. 5B , 2.0 % A2 CMV TMr+ CD8+ T cells were detected of which 36 % coexpressed Pfr and Gzma or Gzmb but only 4 % expressed Ccr7 , while 32 % coexpressed Ccl5 and Mip1b . Gene expressions were strikingly comparable in A2 PPI6–14 , PPI15–24 , and PPI33–42 TMr+ CD8+ T cells data not shown . Considering the whole type 1 diabetic population , the mean percentage of PPI-specific CD8+ T cells that ex-pressed Pfr and Gzma and Gzmb was 16.1 , 11.0 , and 6.9 % , respectively , as compared with 51.5 , 40.7 , and 21.4 % for CMV-specific CD8+ T cells P 0.0003 , P 0.0092 , P 0.0125 , respectively Fig. 5D . Differences in chemokine gene expression were also seen , such as Ccl5 and Mip1b , which drive immune cells to inflammatory sites . Indeed , a higher number of CMV-specific CD8+ T cells expressed Ccl5 compared with PPI-specific CD8+ T cells 81.9 vs. 27.8 % P 0.0026 , and the same result was observed for Mip1b 20.6 vs. 6.0 % P 0.01 . By contrast , Ccr7 , which controls recirculation through lymph nodes , was more expressed by PPI-specific CD8+ T cells 30.9 % than CMV-specific CD8+ cells 3.4 % P , 0.001 . These data sug-gest that PPI-specific CD8+ T cells display gene expression programs that largely overlap TCM rather than TN phe-notypes , based on expression of IFN-g and Rantes genes 33 , whereas CMV-specific CD8+ T cells are predominantly TEM cells . Expression of Fasl , Tnfa , Il2 , Mip1a , and Il10 genes was remarkably rare . Expression of the Il7ra gene was above 70 % in both A2 CMV and A2 PPI peptide TMr+ CD8+ T cells . In contrast with previous reports 34 , the expression of Klrg1 by CMV-specific CD8+ T cells was heterogeneous , whereas it was low in most PPI-specific CD8+ T cells . A significant difference was further observed in expression of Pd1 between PPI-and CMV-specific CD8+ T cells 3.0 vs. 11.1 % P 0.0117 . There was no significant difference in gene expression levels by PPI-specific CD8+ T cells between recent-onset and long-standing type 1 diabetic patients data not shown . In the only control individual who showed detectable PPI6–14–specific CD8+ T cells Fig. 2A , a unique gene expression program was ob-served , with 34 % CD8+ T cells expressing Il10 , as compared with 2.2 6 3.3 % of PPI6–14–specific CD8+ T cells in type 1 diabetic patients . DISCUSSION HLA class I TMrs may prove instrumental in characterizing T cells in autoimmunity . Following previous identification of PPI-specific CD8+ T cells in type 1 diabetes using IFN-g ELISpot 12 , we here report the presence of circulating PPI-specific CD8+ T cells in type 1 diabetes . PPI-specific CD8+ T cells were detected against three major peptides , two within the PPI leader sequence PPI6–14 and PPI15–24 and one within the insulin B chain PPI33–42 also known as B9–18 . CD8+ T cells that were specific for other PPI peptides were only seen in few patients . Overall , CD8+ T cells specific for at least one PPI peptide were detected in 68 % of recent-onset and 83 % of long-standing type 1 diabetic patients . These figures are likely underestimated , since stable TMrs were only obtained with peptides that showed sufficient binding affinity to HLA-A*0201 Table 2 . How-ever , we can not rule out that PPI-specific T cells not tested here are activated in type 1 diabetes and that different peptides are recognized at different stages of type 1 di-abetes because we only tested individuals with clinical diabetes . HLA-A*0201–restricted leader sequence peptides are commonly presented to CD8+ T cells , as previously reported for PPI6–14 and PPI15–24 12,15 . PPI6–14– and PPI15–24– specific CD8+ T cells have previously been shown to be cytotoxic against human islet T cells and HLA-A*0201– transfected P815 target cells , respectively 13,17 . Rec-ognition of PPI15–24 has been reported to increase when human islets were incubated in the presence of high glucose concentrations 17 , adding further insight into its role in the natural history of human type 1 diabetes . The differentiation of memory T cells in relation to an-tigen exposure has been extensively studied in immune responses to viruses but remains poorly understood in autoimmunity . Clinical diabetes occurs after a preclinical phase that spans over years in many patients . However , the b-cell mass in prediabetes and the level of autoantigen ex-posure once diabetes is diagnosed remain unknown 35,36 . The persistence of CMV infection with time makes it a rel-evant control , since T cells are kept exposed to low levels of CMV antigens , as is the case for autoimmune T cells exposed to residual b-cells 36 . We limited our study of membrane markers of PPI-specific CD8+ T cells to CCR7 and CD45RA , which discriminate central memory from effector memory CD8+ T cells . However , CD45RA does not fully correlate with effector memory functions . Markers such as CD27 and CD28 further discriminate at least three and four different CD8+ subsets within CCR72 CD45RA2 and CCR72CD45RA+ CMV-specific cells , respectively 25 . These markers were , however , less relevant to study PPI-specific CD8+ T cells as these cells were mostly within the CD45RA2 CCR7+ central memory compartment . CD45RA+CD45RO+ double-positive T cells have been identified as possibly representing a transi-tion population from naïve CD45RA+ to memory CD45RO+ T cells . This population has been shown to be increased in recent-onset type 1 diabetic patients but not in long-standing patients , possibly reflecting an imbalance between the two CD45 isoforms in autoimmunity 37 . Because we did not exclude CD45RA+CD45RO+ T cells from the analysis of memory cells , we can not exclude that we lost these transi-tion cells that are likely to be included in naïve cells in our analysis . However , we saw the same increase in memory PPI-specific CD8+ T cells in long-standing type 1 diabetic patients in whom the double-positive CD45RA+CD45RO+ T cell is not increased . A recent work has reported the pre-dominant detection of TN and TEMRA CD8+ T cells , but they were specific for different peptides , i.e. , PPI2–10 and PPI34–42 , with higher percentages of detection and in subjects who had possibly been treated with anti-CD3 antibody 38 . Analysis of postactivation CD8+ T cells actually illustrates much greater diversity in survival , recall potentials as well as tissue specificity than is defined by current phenotypic markers 32 . We turned to single cell PCR to study gene expression programs in CD8+ T cells . In contrast to CMV-specific CD8+ T cells that showed effector effector memory phenotypes , PPI-specific CD8+ T cells showed profiles that overlap with those of central memory cells . Gene expres-sion profiles of PPI6–14– and PPI15–24–specific CD8+ T cells in recent-onset type 1 diabetic patients as well as PPI33–42– and PPI15–24–specific CD8+ T cells in long-standing type 1 diabetic patients were identical . Similarities in gene ex-pression patterns of CD8+ T cells specific for PPI leader sequence peptides and B chain PPI33–42 are remarkable because exposition to B chain epitopes persists in insulin-treated , long-standing , type 1 diabetic patients indepen-dently of the persistence of residual b-cells . However , this may not be an exclusive mechanism , since PPI15–24–specific CD8+ T cells were detected in a subset of patients with long-standing diabetes , and thus independently of insulin therapy because insulin preparations are devoid of PPI leader se-quence . No correlation was observed between detection of PPI15–24–specific CD8+ T cells and type 1 diabetes duration . Of further note , a significant fraction of PPI-specific T cells displayed a naïve status that was virtually absent in the CMV-specific repertoire , suggesting that there is still an un-expressed potential for further autoimmune activation in most patients . This unexpressed potential may explain the arousal of PPI33–42–specific CD8+ T cells upon insulin treat-ment in long-standing patients . Indeed , these cells were not detected in type 2 diabetic patients treated with insulin , suggesting that insulin treatment may effectively expand them only in the presence of preexisting autoimmunity . The detection of naïve PPI-specific CD8+ T cells may indicate their preexistence and maintenance in the repertoire of type 1 diabetic patients in relation with the slow chronic process that characterizes type 1 diabetes . Adding further value to the extensive functional characterization carried out by single-cell PCR , one single healthy subject harbored PPI6–14– specific CD8+ T cells expressing the regulatory cytokine Il10 . Thus , the mere presence of autoreactive CD8+ T cells may not be considered pathogenic , as previously suggested for islet-reactive CD4+ T cells 39 . We observed a differentiated CMV-specific CD8+ T cell phenotype , as previously reported 25 , with low expression of Ccr7 and high expression of cytolytic effector molecules and significant diversity among individuals . By contrast , PPI-specific CD8+ T cells expressed higher levels of Ccr7— presumably allowing them to repeatedly circulate to lymph nodes rather than directly homing to the islets—and lower levels of cytolytic effector molecules . An important factor in driving distinct memory T-cell phenotypes is the strength of T-cell activation in relationship with local factors in sec-ondary lymphoid organs in which the initial T-cell activation takes place and at the inflammatory site 32,40 . Expression of homing receptors for lymph nodes have usually been as-sociated with situations in which low strength of activation or a low antigen load is seen 41 . Although in most instances antigen persistence is not required for maintenance of memory T cells , recent data in type 1 diabetes suggest that long-standing type 1 diabetic patients may still harbor re-sidual b-cells 42,43 . The detection of B chain–specific CD8+ T cells in a signif-icant fraction of long-standing type 1 diabetic patients indi-cates that memory CD8+ T cells persist in the long-term range despite the likelihood that autoimmunity to b-cells is progressively downregulated , since residual b-cells disap-pear . This persistence of detectable central memory CD8+ T cells in the long term raises several nonexclusive hypoth-eses . They may persist in the absence of residual b-cells or in the presence of a minimal residual b-cell mass , either resist-ing autoimmune destruction or regenerating as destruction proceeds , as proposed in the NOD model 44 . The persistent detection of PPI6–14– and , to a larger extent , PPI15–24–specific CD8+ T cells in few long-standing patients is compatible with either hypothesis . Alternatively , long-term treatment with ex-ogenous insulin may contribute to activation of T cells against B-chain peptides . This is relevant in the light of the clinical observation that type 1 diabetes is a highly recurrent disease in patients who have been treated with exogenous insulin for years . The negative correlation observed between the per-centage of A2 PPI33–42 TMr+ CD8+ T cells detected in type 1 diabetic patients and residual basal C-peptide values is com-patible with this hypothesis . In conclusion , a majority of type 1 diabetic patients har-bor PPI-specific CD8+ central memory T cells . The absence of these cells in most control individuals makes a strong case for the role of PPI-specific CD8+ T cells in type 1 di-abetes . Although type 1 diabetes is characterized by active autoimmunity many years after disease onset , our obser-vation that exogenous insulin may contribute to expansion of autoreactive CD8+ T cells in the long term brings a new light to the natural history of the disease .
